i ll go first 

fletcher tannon, a mandalorian, was born 22 bby as a mandalorian  not long after his birth, death watch attacked their clan s town and bo katan killed his father  it was related to his father s mandalorian creed, but he never discussed it  he joined the empire late, around the age of 23  he rose through the ranks at the academy quickly and was sent to scarrif to become a death trooper  death trooper dt 271, or fletcher tannon, finished his training with his squadron and entered his first mission, protecting a commander at the battle of endor  the battle seems to go well, until it doesn t  his commander is killed, the higher ranking officers are gone, and the squadron is captured by the rebellion  being their first assignment after the heavy training on scarrif, they didn t know anything useful, but (having little true loyalty to the empire) they revealed everything they knew  mostly info regarding death trooper training, and some bits of info regarding the empire s intentions after the battle of endor (if they succeeded)  the rebellion still places them in custody for a shortened sentence of 3 years, since they were imperial though not guilty of much else  in prison, the squadron s hatred for the empire grew, fletcher especially hating their treatment of mandalorians, his people)  after being freed, the squadron meets on naboo to figure out what they re going to do  fletcher decides to return home to his mother s mandalorian clan, one of the squadron decides to become a bounty hunter (its what he does best, and has no other allies or skills), one joins the new republic, and the last one joins fletcher to go to his home (having no family himself)  when fletcher returns to his mother, he learns how much the tannon clan has changed since he was a child  they allied closely with moff gideon and his claim to mandalore, and have changed their colors to gideon s black and white (though he accepts his father s armor as it was, unchanged and unworn since his death)  and not only that, his clan won t accept his longtime friend as a foundling  he learns of bo s return and the claim of din, a foundling, and his hatred for her burns as the clan rejects her claim, since she didn t accept it by combat, and gideon won it by tradition  though, he is intrigued by din s arrival, as an unknown character to the clans 

basically, a character that shows bo s past, and the effect gideon had among the mandalorians

88,starwars,"i won't bore you with my love of this movie  it's my favorite  i have my reasons  you have your reasons why you might not like it, but i'd love to talk about my writing partner's ideas that would've improved the film and probably also decreased backlash  

1  first and foremost, don't make poe and holdo enemies  make them unwilling partners who both share a love of leia  poe takes after leia's rebellious side  holdo takes after her strategic side  in this version, holdo is on board with the finn  amp  rose mission but has her doubts  she and poe argue about retreat vs  fighting back and how they can keep everyone together  poe still learns his lesson that it's not about being a hero and taking out bad guys  it's about saving lives  

2  instead of fathier racing, it's the children being forced to pod race  get a little nostalgia in there  it changes nothing from the story and a pod racing chase scene would've been awesome! they still get to destroy the casino by flying through it and destroy shady supplies in the process  

3  extend luke's flashback  don't have him immediately buried under rubble  have him caught off guard enough where the attack on his temple is still a success but also show him being a badass that was expected of so many people  he wields his green lightsaber  he takes out a knight of ren or two, spars with a fallen ben and finally forces them to retreat   then he self exiles in shame  

even as someone who loves this movie, i can easily say that these three very minor changes extensions would've improved the movie and pleased more star wars fans  plus, it keeps in tact all the things that i find amazing in this film ","the last jedi is my favorite star wars film, but my friend suggested three minor tweaks that even i think would've made the film better!"

118,starwars,"you got this simple farm boy from sand world  he has two loving parents  they're not his mom and dad but they love him as a son  

then one day things get a little out of his hand with his new robot toys and when he gets home, his parents    the man and woman who raised him, the folks that are bit hard on him but still understand him enough    well they're just vaporized aren't they? they're not stabbed  they're not shot  they are fucking skeletons! and luke is just    well it appears to suck a little for him  definitely gonna put a damper on his day  it's at least gonna make the next hour kinda shitty  

but then this old guy, ben, who he's known for all of about thirteen hours is struck down by another random stranger and luke just about loses his shit  death to space nazis! death to robot men with red laser swords! death to anyone who insulted this old man who could do magic tricks! it's depression time    his magician buddy is gone  shit, he might not even actually be dead  there wasn't a body and luke is pretty confident he heard him tell him to run away    but he ain't actually here with luke so he might as well let this hot girl who only lost her entire fucking planet comfort him 

skip ahead a bit and luke goes to avenge his surrogate grandpa who he knew in real life for less than a day and still may or may not be around    it's kinda unclear to luke, as he was either hallucinating on the brink of an icy death or had been chilling with a talking frog the past few days so it made sense  

anyways, he confronts the murderous robot human who is also space hitler    but also his daddy! that's right! space hitler killed luke's friend, but now he's also ready to be a part of his life and have a real relationship, provided a lil' genocide is on the table every now and then  luke says no but then mulls it over a bit and like    maybe? if he can convince his deadbeat dad to stop committing genocide and in fact fight against the genocide    maybe they can do that game of catch every once in a while and enjoy the benefits of traditional family values  

tl dr  luke doesn't give a fuck about the people who raised him as their own from birth, but a few hours is all he needs to grow permanently attached to a religious hermit and literally space hitler who killed the religious hermit 

obviously, this post is tongue and cheek  i'm just saying that star wars has _always_ been inconsistent and silly with its characters and that's okay  we can still love it and appreciate what we got rather than hating what we didn't ",let's talk about luke skywalker for a second because this guy is wild!

128,starwars,,a star wars comic i drew a few years ago 
129,starwars,"in the mandalorian we get to see the legend himself  luke skywalker  he is a fully realized jedi, and he is now the most famous man in the galaxy  luke is now spending his days traveling the galaxy, looking for force sensitive beings to induct into the new jedi order  this is his chance to save the jedi once and for all  

and this is where everything falls apart  

in tlj, we learn that luke sensed the dark side in ben and acted on impulse, trying to kill ben so that he couldn't destroy what luke had worked to build with his blood, sweat, and tears  at first, like a majority of others, i couldn't believe my eyes  luke skywalker would never do that! how could luke do such a thing, this isn't luke!

and then i saw luke in the mandalorian, and all the puzzle pieces came together  picture this  you're luke skywalker, you have defeated your father and the empire is practically no more   all eyes  in the galaxy are now on you  you are the legendary luke skywalker, you are the paragon of good, you can do no wrong  and you accept this, you allow the legend to permeate and spread because, what? are you going to tell these people not to look up to you? you who, in their eyes, single handedly took down the two most feared men in the galaxy? so instead, you allow this to happen while devoting yourself to rebuilding the jedi order  remember, at this time, you believe that you are the   only   chance the jedi have left  so, you do what is expected of you  you go around the galaxy, you recruit students, and you do your best to teach them the ways of the jedi of old  after a decade, perhaps more, of doing this, it happens  you sense something, something you haven't felt in what feels like a millennia  you brush it off, thinking that one of your students is frustrated, or having a bad day  then it comes back, and then again, and again  you keep getting these pangs of dark, and you know where they're coming from  but it's ben! han and leia's child! it's ridiculous to think that he would ever harbor such negative emotion  he's probably just prone to impulses like his father  but    as the months drag on, you cannot ignore the growing darkness in his heart  you've tried to advice him, to remind him of the jedi ways, and he scoffs  he won't listen  one day you're patrolling the grounds and you feel it, the dark side  you haven't felt it so intensely since    since vader and the emperor  you, the legendary luke skywalker, heir to the jedi, now has a tangible threat to your jedi order  years spent trying to foster a new jedi order, and one of your students can spell the end of it all  doubt creeps in, ""how could i let this happen, i'm luke!?"" after doubt, comes fear, ""if ben turns on us, on my students, everything will be lost  i will have failed the jedi, failed the new republic  the jedi as the galaxy knows it will be destroyed forever ""

fear is the path to the dark side  fear leads to anger  anger leads to hate  hate leads to suffering  

so you do it  you resolve to destroy the roots before they can spread  you enter ben's room, lightsaber in hand, you ignite it  you are going to save the jedi  your own morality no longer matters, it is the good of the galaxy and the fate of the jedi, for the life of one man  then, ben looks at you, fear in his eyes  you realize that you've gotten it all wrong  you have failed  it is you that has driven ben to the dark side  ben collapses the room before you can protest and runs away, never to return  it was you, it was the legendary luke skywalker that destroyed the jedi order  

as you can see  i believe that it was the legend of luke skywalker and the pressure put upon him by the entire galaxy that drew the dark side to manifest itself in him again, as it had when he fought vader  the dark side was always there in him, it didn't disappear forever when he forgave his father  it bided its time, and prayed upon his fears and doubts as his legend grew larger  and in that one fateful moment, he fell from grace, and the rest is history  i hope that this gets expounded upon more in the future, because i think it reminds us all that luke is still just a person  he has flaws, and he can make mistakes in the heat of the moment  luke is not the unfillable legend that we all believed him to be  that is why i think luke in tlj works so well and why the mandalorian only reinforces that  now, i'm not a fool, obviously 99  of y'all are gonna disagree and drag me through the mud, but it wouldn't be the first time  i just hope that you can look at luke in a new perspective, even if you still vehemently disagree with me  after all, it is multifaceted and complex characters that make star wars so much more interesting than many other properties out there  i would love to hear your own takes on luke and where he will end up  thank you for reading  

tldr  the legendary luke skywalker realized in the mandalorian does not retcon tlj luke, but reinforces it  the pressure of the galaxy on his shoulders is what allowed the dark side to manifest itself within him despite avoiding it for decades ",the mandalorian has made me appreciate tlj more than i thought i would

which brings up another question   where did din get his old armor?  was it beskar?  if so how did the mudhorn manage to dent it?  did mando choose those mismatched dried blood red and bright blue colors of his old armor?  do you think he will ever paint his armor? or remain literally the only mando we've ever seen without paint?  sorry i'm rambling now ",was dins right thigh piece not beskar?

234,starwars,"(   couldn't care less if luke is grumpy or he dies  the sequel triology has some fun and entertaining scenes too i think 

   peequels aren't fantastic films, very average but they don't ruin the franchise  they weren't trying to change the cannon (which when you change basic rules set in a fantasy universe you are pretty much saying the writers don't know what to do )

tldr   it's the blatant laziness, cashgrab that i hate 

i know fans think that the sequel triology will soon be regarded good in star wars fans eyes  just like the prequels  i don't see that happening  why?

 1  lazy writing

force awaken, everyone force sensitive, everyone super lucky, random kid levitate rake, rey super powerful, luke super grumpy, liea actually trained to be a jedi so she can stay alive after the blast on the ship  

this is what the new sequel triology is to me  this hurts the franchise  throwing absolute dogshit around, doing whatever the story wants the charachters to do  they give whole explanation of liea being more or less a jedi in 5 seconds ( ahem  george was apparently going to put leia incharge in his new triology, the creator of the whole franchise wanted something else that made more sense then what disney chose  ahem ) just for a 3 minute subversion scene  this is the trainwreck the new movies are 

force is such a vague device used in all the movies, never explained ( ahem  which george was apparently going to in his new triology  ahem )  it's more like force is used whenever the writer doesn't know what to do now 

i'm a new fan  they never explain what the force is  so from what i understand from the lore present, they still never explained all of this is any of the movies yet 

force isn't meant to be sentient is it, it's more or less like gravity, a thing that exists everywhere around us, the only thing is beings with midi chlorians can manipulate it? so why is it awake 

why didn't it awake before  (it created anakin the chosen one yes, but in the new triology everyone somehow is super lucky because of the force, a random child can levitate a rake and call it towards him now)

if it did awake why is it helping the jedis because as far as i know, both the sith and jedi use the force  dark force and good force aren't two entities fighting so why is it trying to create balance in the first place  

who are the skywalkers, why are they so powerful 

what happened to palpatine's son daughter  who even married them, why did they, and what happened after a daughter was given birth to  

why can palpatine only care for granddaughter and not his real daughter son

there were always only jedi's, no sith's  the force when used with anger and selflessness can give someone the power of the dark side  so why did sith's originated in the first place  the only sense i can make of it is a jedi wanted something only the dark force can achieve, so he turned evil to gain the powers and help himself  why is it never explained

why is vader a moron  all he cared for once was power and being a jedi master and learning more  then he turns dark and doesn't learn the sexy brain transfer trick palpatine used to stay alive in rise of skywalker   why didn't the sith before palpatine use it 

so much is left unexplained and what they chose to do is prequels  which fair play, george wanted to do them for fun  he had no plans of ever making star wars seriously after the ot  they didn't ruin the logic, they just were badly made films that are liked now because they are a meme  they are hilarious and give atleast some insight  they are passionate but not lazy 

2  clickbait

""rey is actually a sith robot""

what if kathleen comes out and announces this tomorrow? just think this for a moment   yeah?

this is what most star wars fans felt while watching the last jedi  the problem isn't what luke does  it's just absolutely dogshit clickbait 

clickbait isn't subversion

why do you think they didn't make other movies or shows before making a skywalker triology, and then said ""these new movies are not for people who are nostalgic""

any way you approach it, these movies are cashgrabs  after acquiring lucasfilms, they didn't take a second to announce star wars and luke is back! when you say that, it logically means they are calling out the star wars fans who love the franchise 

then you build up hype, you release a 30 sec scene of a 
beloved hero (a good scene) but you do all this for hype  

then on last jedi, poof? what is the return here from the hype you generate  it's like if apple teases an revolutionary product, and releases a 800  plastic stand  you will receive backlash for that ","a explanation on why i, who started watching star wars in 2020, still hates the sequel triology and why i think they won't be as liked as the prequels"

i want to poke a bear, so most of star wars has so many plot holes  after watching the sequel i went back and watched the original and prequel trilogy  i love this series and so invested we mando season ending perfect got me deeper into star wars but man if we take a way the cool universe, dark and light symbolism, saber fights, lovable characters and one liners  you see tons of plot holes  it's wild because the new trilogy is said to have many issues but i sat here and watched the prequel and original trilogy and both are super flawed story wise  gonna ask you guys to drop some things that don't add up  


letting a ship get away because it had no life forms but they were looking for information  

leia she remembers her mom? how? her mama died at birth 

how obi got so old between 19 year's he ages like a clone  

obi forgot about leia when saying luke is our last hope but he was there for birth 

obi still wearing his robe but hiding he is a jedi?

obi tells anakin he will be more powerful if he kills him, still killed him but somehow anakin  learns how to be a force ghost ?


luke learn to be a jedi quick  which would be ok if others did the same but they didn't except maybe rey

257,starwars,"ok yall i have developed a spicy theory that will make sriracha seem like it is vanilla yogurt and here it is  plo koon is alive and will return  this theory comes from 3 bits of info

first off we know that plo koon was killed in order 66 right? wrong we know his ship was shot down but we never had a confirmation of his death  the clones shooting at him were solders he had fought alongside of for 3 years in the clone wars  plo also was a phenomenal pilot and the lego model of his space ship has an eject button 

second we know that plo koon was the jedi who brought ahsoka tano into the jedi order and was her mentor for years  were he to make a cameo it would be huge for the upcoming series 

third dave filoni is a huge fan of plo koon and he has stated in an interview that he does not believe plo is dead  who is dave filoni you ask? the director of the clone wars series and projected director of the ahsoka tano series 

finally plo koon is one of the only cannon jedi who do not speak to rey in episode 9! of all the voice actors who make an appearance in episode 9 plo koon's voice actor james taylor is not one of them (i went back and listened 4 times to confirm) 

to summarize this whole thing we know that plo is a member of the baran do order, a force sensitive order of kel dor who survived order 66 due to their small size  plo koon likely ejected from his ship, fled to his home planet and has remained with the baran do order until his appearance in the ahsoka tano series in 2022 

what are your thoughts? let me know below ",plo koon is alive and will return (soon) and here is why

322,starwars,"force users abilty to fight extremely fast and deflect blaster fire allways had me wondering how they did it  we know that force users can sense the future and the and near future seems more certain than distant future, this got me thinking 
could it be that force users are sensing the future when they fight? 
my idea is that the next two seconds are so firm in their minds that they are actually fighting two seconds into the future, what we see as blinding speed is actually the force users just going through the motions of a move they allready finished in their minds waiting to be able to get to the next move they have allready seen through the force  
the same with blaster fire, they know where the round will hit every time because they have seen them itso they simply but their sable in the way

349,starwars,"i am not a fan of rogue one  a star wars story  i'd even go so far as to say it's my least favourite disney era star wars film  

however, i am clearly in the minority on this, and everyone else on this reddit hails it as one of the best or the best film in the franchise  i've seen lots of people defend it for a multiple reasons that i personally don't agree with, but i was hoping some of you guys could shed some more light on your personal reasons for liking this film that i'm just not getting 

for argument's sake, i do have a quick run down of my likes and dislikes on the film  i just wanted to outline the things that make it frustrating in my opinion to watch, as well as acknowledge the good that is in it, as it is not the worst movie if all time by any means 

likes 
  the cinematography is good  like really good  some real gorgeous shots throughout
  the space battles are well executed from a technical standpoint 
  i actually like cassian andor and would like to see more of him as he was really under used imo (looking forward to the disney  series)
  the joke where the stormtroopers put a bag over chirrut's head and he exclaims ""are you kidding me?! i am blind"" legitimately made me laugh out loud
  it actually made the empire threatening
  the cgi on tarkin and leia, while not quite there yet, is an impressive feat and looked better than i thought it would

dislikes 
  the characters  just    the characters  i had a hard time caring about any of them, and i can usually forgive a dumb plot and other flaws if i like the characters enough 
       saw gerrera   i have no idea what the point of his character is and it is not acted well  we don't see any of his relationship with jyn as her ""adopted"" father and his death is meaningless  if this character type is in your movie, it's kind of an unwritten rule that you should see a connection between them and their adoptive child 
       jyn erso   i also don't care about jyn  she has no particular skills, likes or dislikes that made me relate to her  lots of other characters had something to bring to the team (sharpshooting, hand to hand combat, imperial knowledge, etc) but she just    is related to someone who's actually important? i also didn't buy her relationship with her dad of sudden belief in the rebellion in act 2  again if we had some time anywhere in the movie to see their relationship or her view of the world i might have cared but i just    didn't  she's also a super passive character, basically being dragged along everywhere she went and told what to do until she decides she likes the rebellion, which again made no sense to me 
       bodhi rook   not a bad character per se, but so much wasted potential, and again we know nothing about him  he defected from the empire but    why? then he gets his brain scrambled and then is fine 2 minutes later? and then the movie kind of forgets he's even there? this one is more frustrating because of how much people hate on finn for his wasted potential, when bodhi has a pretty similar set up, but is given even less insight into why he defected and everyone seems fine with it 
       baze malbus   not much to say, i just don't know much about him aside from ""he has a gun""
       k 2so   i didn't find him funny, and he was essentially just a one liner machine  for how much people rag on the comedy in the sequel trilogy, i'm surprised he doesn't get more flack

  the first two thirds of the movie are a bit of a mess  i literally got whiplash from how many planets we went to in such a short amount of time and how many things were happening  imo it was needlessly complicated for a plot that can be summed up with ""rebels steal the death star plans"" 
  i didn't care during the fight scenes, even the darth vader hallway scene  like, it was well executed, filmed and choreographed well, i just didn't get excited about it like a lot of people did 
  the whole idea that galen intentionally put that design flaw in the death star is kind of lame  like, if you were going to put in something like that to destroy the death star, why make it so hard to hit, and if it's not supposed to be that hard to hit, it kind of devalues the significance of luke's accomplishment 
  also did not buy the emotion in galen's message to jyn  just did not feel genuine to me  we never get a single moment of the two of them together to connect with their relationship, and as a result, the whole thing rang hollow for me 

if you loved this movie, i really want to hear why! all the things i mentioned are my opinion, and clearly i'm just not getting the same out of it as a lot of people are, so i'm curious about hearing some real peoples' thoughts  

please try to keep the conversation civil!! we're all star wars fans here and i don't want to crap on anyone's opinions ",why does everyone love rogue one?

first fifteen minutes quickly flashes through kis life and him having his many children and becoming a member of the jedi council

then skips to his defeat on the battle of hypori and stages general grevious as the main villain  

ki adi mundi is crippled by defeat and turns to smoking spice which he becomes addicted to  although he keeps his addicted hidden from the council his many baby mummies find out and revoke his rights to see his children  

mundi befriends an old pilot friend called olabar and they smoke spice together and talk about their pasts  

mundi and olabar agree to track down general grevious so they can be sound  without the jedi councils knowledge they fly off to general grevious ship and board 

after a legendary lightsaber duel ki adi mundi is defeated  just as general grevious is to cut off mundis head the ship turns sharply and a brick knocks mundi and grevious into an elevator shaft leaving their lightsabers behind 

mundi chucks around grevious with the force and remarks that he is  trapped down here with no freaking spice   grevious then opens up to mundi that he was also once addicted to spice and they have a deep chat about their addictions and how to overcome  

after two days in the shaft spending time with grevious causes mundi to discover his sith side  count mundi uses his sith powers to lightning force the elevator shaft and spark it to work again  grevious and mundi leave in peace and mundi returns  i forgot to mention olabar died during the initial battle 

mundi goes back to the jedi council and get his life back together but has lost touch with his children  

the film ends during order 66 when mundi is shot down  however annakin finds him and senses his sith side and heals his gun wound using jedi powers 

whilst assumed dead mundi escapes in ship 

the film will be followed by a dark comedy sit com about mundi finding his children ",ki adi munda biopic idea

435,starwars,"first off, i love pretty much all star wars media, including series, spinoffs and the sequels    


generally it seems that revenge of the sith gains the top spot for most folks, where a phantom menace and attack of the clones compete for the bottom spot  the deciding factor being how much one dislikes jar jar or sand    


the reason i favor aotc for the top spot overall is in a sense twofold  its about what it does, and about what the other two does not   


phantom menace is actually a brilliant star wars film  it expands daringly upon the force, it introduces mulitple fan favorite characters, and it sets the pace for the other two by setting up threads of political division and jedi failure  there are plenty of real life sets and props, and the music is fabulous  it also introduces some of the coolest worlds  the reason it doesnt quite do it for me is essentially scale  wheras the meta plot about the return of the sith and anakins induction to the order is fantastic, the actual plot is about a trade dispute and blockade, which means it cant quite match up to the start of the clone wars, or its dramatic conclusion   


revenge of the sith, on the other hand, should easily be the best but it lets me down in some core areas which means i never have quite so much fun  i know that is controversial, but some primary mistakes or shortcomings can be how it wasted padme as a character, how the magnificent opening space battle is followed by what feels like a video game level, how so much of the combat and action is centered around battledroids which are used as much for comic relief as for actual tensionbuilding, and how three out of five lightsaber duels are in my opinion subpar or directly dissapointing  dooku vs anakin and obi wan is good enough, obi wan vs anakin is awesome, but the remaining three just dont work  the battle with grievous is so unengaging, and given how climactic the duel between mace and sidious should have been it is a massive letdown  the yodavsidious duel is fine, but i think they missed a trick given how powerful they both are, and we should have seen more large scale force battling    


attack of the clones, on the other hand, is always super fun and rewarding for me to watch  the only real drawback is some cringy scenes with anakin and padme, which are excusable at best  it begins with one of the best opening scenes in star wars, with the naboo shuttle turning in space above coruscant and some awesome sound design from the engine  it then goes into some fun setup with the assasination attempts and a logical starting point, that being obi wan and anakin sent to protect padme due to their familiarity  we have some really cool exploration of the relationship between anakin and the jedi, anakin and obi wan, and between anakin and palpatine  it shows the best of what obi wan and anakin has together, but shows the shortcomings of obi wan as a master to anakin as well  we get jango fett as a badass villain with what in my opinion is a super interesting intrigue arch, leading not only to the revelation of kamino as another cool world, but the introduction of the clones  all the while anakin and padmes relationship is furthered, and some really good groundwork is laid for anakins eventual betrayal with the death of his mother  the two storylines are tied together with each other and the meta plot, being the approaching war between the seperatists and the republic  as a payoff we get the sublime arena scenes, with some kickass jedi action (in a time where droids are allowed to be more threatening) and the superb entry of yoda and the clones  the film kind of wraps up with my favorite confrontation of the prequels, being the showdown with dooku   we get to see some awesome bladework from dooku, and some interesting storytelling  obi wan is smarter than anakin, but anakin has more raw talent as a duelist  both are relatively swiftly defeated, and then we get a super tense and cool force duel between yoda and dooku, finally showcasing yodas power (this is also the first time we get to see tutaminis) and i think they nailed the balance with regards to having dooku dueling yoda without it feeling too odd    


overall i always enjoy aotc, wheras rots and pm leaves me wanting or slightly dissapointed  all are great star wars films, but attack is my definite favorite ",attack of the clones is (by far) my favorite prequel era film

i imagine that there was plenty of fighting that happened off screen   there were an awful lot of pilots in the briefing room compared to what we saw get blown up   i know in one of the books it talked about how there were more pilots than ships but why brief them all if half of them weren't going up?

523,starwars,"all of marvels phase 4 and 5 movies are going to deal with some extremely out there premises  wandavision and loki s trailers prove that  and are people upset over multiple timelines being setup? no not at all, it is probably looked forward to as much as any movies and shows have ever been  

so the sequel trilogy can most definitely be undone or at least just be a really really shitty bad dream universe separate from the one we all grew up with  

favreau, filoni, feige(the brains behind all 22 mcu movies so far and a dozen to come as well as a dozen shows) george lucas and all the directors that have helped on the mandalorian are writing and developing a story that kathleen kennedy can only envy over and will try to rob us of considering she robbed us from jjs episode 8 and trevorows episode 9 as well as george lucass sequel trilogy  

who in there right mind has george lucas hand them an almost complete trilogy and tell the mastermind himself, no thanks i think i can do better  i mean omg  

if you don t think the st is gonna be erased or at least swept under a rug to exist in some alternate reality which doesn t affect the star wars fans want then you aren t paying attention to what disney is doing with star wars  

not 1!! i repeat not a single one of the 11 star wars shows announced a few weeks ago are going to be about the sequel trilogy  these shows won t be behind us until 2025 probably  then what do you think disney is going to do? all of a suddden make a rey or finn show? hahaha i really doubt that  

filoni has delivered with the clone wars and rebels  he has proven he can write amazing stories while having his hands tied(bc he has sw lore to adhere to ) 

the problem in kennedy s eyes is dave filoni doesn t look the part, isn t a woman and could care less what she wants bc he is only concerned with staying true to what lucas began  

all kennedy really has to do is set back and let them turn it around and she can come out of this, as much as i would hate it, in a good spot, having helped return star wars to its peak  i do not see that from her at all  she just cannot stand people like ideas that aren t hers  

the woke movement has good intentions at heart but a population isn t much different then a 3 year old  if you tell them to be one way they will most likely not listen bc no one wants told what to do  however if they can be swayed that way by great storytelling in the subtlest way that s fine with me  all stories have morals  it s just stupid for kennedy to assume shoving the moral in our face before the story is even told  the force is female t shirts  will actually work  

has anyone thought about bill burr? i guarantee kennedy didn t want to hire him  he is as anti woke as anyone i ve ever heard from  that s just favreau rubbing his clout he has now in her face  lmao  

john favreau is so much smarter then her  so is filoni and so is feige  

here s to a wonderful decade full of amazing star wars that in the process explains what was wrong with the sequels while simultaneously undoing them ","after wandavision, loki, spiderman3 antman 3 and dr  strange  if well received the star wars universe will introduce a similar concept  don t forget that favreau and feige started iron man and the mcu   that is the same formula star wars has now  the future is bright  don t be naive"

i m a relatively new star wars fan (started watching in july of 2020)  honestly, if it weren t for star wars, i don t see how i could have survived through 2020 with my sanity intact 

the pandemic made sure i lost every opportunity i had created for myself through four years of college  everything  a decent source of income, most of my self confidence and dignity, and above all, hope 

even buying disney  was a screw up on my part  i wanted to buy amazon prime and ended up buying disney   maybe watching mcu s superheroes live out their larger than life dreams could instil in me a sense of confidence, but no (btw, mcu s universe has a ridiculously low rewatch value   at least for me) 

switched over to watching star wars, and life started getting better  almost magically  luke s story of clinging on to that last bit of hope inspired me  i started seeing more opportunities, talking to like minded people more, and enjoying myself, even if a little bit  life picked up 

yesterday, i got a job  finally  in this post covid market  i m talking to my friends about stargazing trips (again, after many, many years)  i have begun seeing hope   finally 

sorry about this rant  i just had to let it out  don t know if it fits the sub s rules or not

538,starwars,,"with all the new fans recently, i am so jealous of you! i many times with i could wipe me memory and watch it all again for the first time!"
539,starwars,"   the grysk hegemony 

i'm sorry if someone has already posted something similar but i've looked before and couldn't find any theories on it so here is my own 

for those who don't know, the grysk are a warlike species from the unknown region who, for decades, have been amassing a fleet to invade the galaxy  in essence, the grysk are disney's version of the yuuzhan vong, who, for those of you that are fans of star war legends, brought untold destruction to the galaxy 

my theory is this  in the time between return of the jedi and the force awakens, the grysk invaded the galaxy, brought a similar level of destruction to the galaxy, and the mandalorian is disney's way of introducing us to this new storyline  first, let's backtrack a bit  the grysk are a species known by the chiss and brought to the attention of the empire by grand admiral thrawn  in fact, this was the premise of thrawn  alliances and thrawn  treason  according to thrawn  treason, the grysk has already begun making small advances into imperial territory in 1bby (the same time as the final season of star wars  rebels)  in addition, we know from these books that the chiss are either currently engaged or about to become engaged in a civil war which will be used to the grysks advantage  adding to the grysks favor, the galactic civil war causes the collapse of the empire, which was perhaps the only military power capable of defeating them 

now at the end of star wars  rebels grand admiral thrawn disappears with ezra to who knows where but we know from the mandalorian that he is not dead and that ahsoka is looking for him  furthermore, in the mandalorian, when the new republic officer talks to cara dune, he tells her that there is ""something going on out here"" and that no one in the core worlds believes it  some might be inclined to believe that he's referring to the empire reorganizing itself into the first order but i'm more inclined to believe that its the empire, or at least a remnant led by thrawn, trying to strengthen itself against the grysk 

the fact is, the sequel trilogy takes place 35 years after return of the jedi and so there is no reason why the new republic would've let the first order build a superweapon like starkiller base during this time  however, what if the new republic was relatively powerless to stop the first order from rising because they were weakened while fighting the grysk? the biggest piece of evidence i have for this is coruscant  why is it that coruscant, which was the home to the republic and the empire, is not the capital of the new republic? what makes hosnian prime so special that it replaces coruscant as the capital? i believe that coruscant was attacked and even invaded by the grysk during their invasion (similar to the vong's invasion of coruscant) and so the new republic was forced to make hosnian prime its new capital  this is further supported by the fact that we know that by the events of the force awakens, coruscant had fallen into lawlessness and was overrun by criminals  this would also explain why we never see coruscant in the sequels when yet we see other familiar planets moons like endor and bespin  because disney didn't want to spoil it 

adding to my evidence are the newly announce ahsoka and rangers of the new republic tv shows  both are set around the time of the mandalorian and so we can guess what the ahsoka show will be about  thrawn  more importantly though, this ahsoka show will most likely be our (the viewer) first introduction on screen to the grysk and will be about ahsoka learning about them from thrawn and maybe even ezra  if this is true, then this will most likely lead to luke's new jedi order beginning to learn about the threat of the grysk 

however, we have little news of rangers of the new republic but i believe it will deal with the new republic becoming aware of the grysk  in fact, according to disney's blog regarding the announcement of this show, rangers and ahsoka will ""intersect with future stories and culminate into a climactic story event""   lt     the grysk 

it's happening! the grysk are coming and the galaxy will be in for a rude awakening 

tl dr  an unknown alien force known as the grysk is going to invade the galaxy between the events of rotj and the force awakens and disney has been keeping it a secret ", spoilers   theory  the mandalorian is the stepping stone into the next big storyline in the sw universe

my friend and i have decided to embark on rewriting and ironing out the kinks and mistakes in the star wars sequel trilogy  we ve identified the majority of big things that people don t like from the different reviews, complaints and forums, but i wanted to ask for different things here  we plan on putting the finished book (s?) on archive of our own, so it will be accessible to those who plan on reading it  

the main thing that we are changing is that we plan on going more into the first order  the main complaint we ve seen about them is that we don t know anything about them  we also plan on adding midichlorians into it, backstory for finn, rey (no palpatine) and ben  we plan on cutting snoke out from the beginning and making kylo the supreme leader  

the force awakens  so we re including midichlorians (from the prequels)  the idea is that they re trying to rebuild the jedi  they make  clones  and use them as younglings  ben is not strong with the force, and has a lot of mental health issues that the adults in his life like to gloss over  in the movies, it s revealed that luke saw the darkness in ben s heart and tried to kill him  which makes no fucking sense but i won t get into it  in our rewrite, ben tries to kill himself  the skywalkers have a blood curse that prevent them from being killed by anyone who isn t of their bloodline, but it makes their blood toxic  ben, in his haze, assumes that luke was trying to kill him and runs away to join the first order that s more like communism in theory than how it was used  he becomes a sort of anti hero portrayed as a villain because the resistance comes in and wipes out the majority of the younglings to end the jedi because they re corrupt as shit and he gets the blame for it  rey and finn are two of the younglings who escape  ben finds them (he s about 10 years older than them) and puts rey on her planet and takes finn in as a stormtrooper  the force awakens is basically the same from there

589,starwars,"let's get one thing straight  i used to believe anakin did nothing wrong, as it was because of the circumstances the jedi put him in, he was backed into a corner and had no choice  

but    i went into group therapy for a year, where they specialize in preventing domestic violence  

and one of the things i learned in the class are these forms of control and power, along with abusing the person you're with   blaming, minimizing, and denial  

blaming is when you put the blame of your actions onto somebody or something else   the way many people blame the jedi order for anakin's actions and turn to the dark side  

minimizing is when you minimize an action you do  for instance, if you closed fist punch someone in the face, you say ""i only smacked you in the face! it wasn't that bad!"" 

and i think we all know what denial is   it's when you straight up deny your actions  ""i didn't punch you! what are you talking about? you're crazy!"" 

due to this, i learned to take responsibility for my actions  it doesn't matter what anybody or anything does, i am water, not soda  if you shake a bottle of water, nothing happens  if you shake a bottle of soda, it explodes   basically, it shouldn't matter that the jedi kidnapped anakin and took him away from his mom, never trusted him, always looked down on him, etc  none of that is a justificatory reason for anakin's horrific actions  

in real life, if anybody killed a school of children, i highly doubt any anakin defenders would jump onto defending this cold hearted, horrible individual     so why is anakin so defended? 

he not only killed an entire school of young padawan, who are all children between the ages of like 5 10  and on top of that, he is worse than hitler  come on, dude issued the death star which destroyed an entire planet! he slaughtered probably hundreds of thousands of people, and nothing, and i mean nothing justifies that action  

how would you feel if someone decided to randomly destroy earth, and all of its inhabitants? kill off all of your friends, family, people you will never meet now who could change your life, and if you don't care about humans and care more about pets    anakin killed all your dogs, all your cats, all your lizards and snakes and fish and literally every single thing on the planet  

how are people defending this monster? i don't get it anymore  

dude is a pure and utter horrific monster  anakin skywalker is, not darth vader because guess what, they are the same person! and this can be seen as blaming, again, which is a means of power and control  anakin, luke, everybody who defends anakin puts the blame on darth vader  ""anakin didn't do it, darth vader did "" yeah, no, that doesn't work  anakin is darth vader and anakin killed millions  don't put the blame on some made up person and take responsibility for your actions, anakin  

sorry for the long rant, but i feel this must be said  it's important to one's livelihood to have a good mental health, and seeing anakin as a good person    isn't really healthy  and i would know, because i wasn't mentally healthy when i believe anakin did nothing wrong ",anakin skywalker   why do people defend this horrible person?

604,starwars,,picture i took on dathomir
605,starwars,"i really liked the last jedi  it gave a new feel in the sw universe and really showed the war that is in star wars  however there were 3 things plot wise that i can't roll over and accept  i believe if these things were addressed in a minor edit, the movie might be more widely accepted, rather a movie like tros which needs a whole new cut to be salvaged 

1  poe and leia's character arc

poe's whole arc in tlj is to learn to be less a one man super warrior focused on the objective and more a commander whose focused on the lives of his comrads  leia tries to teach him this by expressing how many lives, including the bombing fleet, were wiped out  and those casualties should've been avoided by fleeing the fight  later in the movie, they land on a base on crait and poe is still thinking about his failure  problem is, the dreadnought can wipe out bases with a single shot from orbit, as they did with the resistance's first base in the beginning of the film  so if poe did not risk the lives of the bombing fleet and destroy the dreadnought, husk kylo ren could've just ordered the dreadnought to blow up the crait base from orbit  now, all of this could've been fixed with a simple line like ""this old base is so reinforced, not even a dreadnought blast can take it down "" cheesy? yes, but it leaves audience members like me not questioning whether poe was right all along 

2  finn and rose's bogus adventure

i really like both of these characters, yet i felt half of the film was spent on an adventure with no real pay out, mainly for the plot convenience of having 2 main characters not stay on the ship  it felt like one of those tv shows where they send half the cast on an adventure that episode just for it to lead to nothing and serve as no consequence to the greater show  i felt like every point they tried to establish either fell flat or, most importantly, had no pay off in the film or in tros  

rose tries to explain to finn not to run away, ending his timid character arc (that is fixed in the first 5 minutes of them meeting) 

rose tries to tell finn that the nice things in the galaxy are probably just rich people abusing their wealth and power (never going back to this thought) 

dj explains to finn that the good guy vs bad guy thing is wrong, that people are not just one or the other and the same people selling your equipment sells to the fo as well  (never bringing this great philosophical point up again)

they meet a slave kid who is force sensitive and gives him a resistance ring  the kid later stares in the sky at the end of the movie and shows the audience he's force sensitive, only for the movies to abandon him and this plot entirely 

they fail the entire 40  minute mission of getting the code breaker (wrong guy) and get captured  but its fine because we had a different plot going on the whole time with trying to make it to crait  it just felt like a terrible side story with no pay off or message that is throughly embedded  if they hammered one of these points in the whole adventure or just gave a plot payout for those characters for taking the adventure, other than the plot convenience of being on the supreme ship to have a rematch with phasma, i would've accepted the entire adventure  

3  luke forgets about redemption

i really like hermit luke  as far as i'm aware, hermit luke was even in george lucas' original drafts of ep 7 8 because he didn't want the main hero coming in and wiping away the new heroes problems  what i absolutely despised was the 3 version flashback of how ben became kylo  it makes perfect sense that luke looses his order and goes to exile because he feels responsible  it does not make sense that luke skywalker, the man who spent an entire movie trying to convince the galaxy's  1 murderer to become good again, sees a dark vision of his wannabedarthvader nephew, and decides to kill him in his sleep  its just, not in his character to do that  even if ben was in the middle of his blitzkrieg of the galaxy, luke would still try to convince him of returning to the light  immediately giving up on his family member because of a chance  a vision of the future is ridiculous for his character  

look these are a few things that really bug me from the writing perspective because some things in the film happen purely for plot convenience rather than ultimate payoffs which a long running universe like sw always is good at, see mandalorian  unfortunately i see having a one man rian johnson director writer be the problem  even in the bts of tlj you can see luke and rian arguing about the direction of the character and rian says something along the lines of ""i get how you feel but just do the story as its written for you "" if a writer is stuck in his head with a grand story idea with so much going on, he looses perspectives that other writers should've called him out on  like i said, with minor dialog edits and maybe a cut or two, tlj would stand as one of the bests imo, it doesn't need a massive overhaul or reedit like tros ",rant  the last jedi is a good movie but needs some serious edits

674,starwars,"though i only found the sequels mediocre at best and really bad at some points at worst,i feel like there's a lot of potential in the sequels to be expanded upon 


take the sith eternal for example 


sure the movie pretty much tells you that they're all dead and buried,but just because 1 hideout of sith cultists on 1 planet in the middle of nowhere in the unknown region is destroyed,that doesn't mean that the whole freaking thing is just gone(unless the sith eternal is only on exegol then in that case i'm dumb) 


plus,i don't think we see the more esoteric and fanatical side of the empire imperial remnant enough  seeing an imperial remnant like the sith eternal is very interesting in my opinion  i kind of want them to bring the sith eternal back, i want them to fight not only the new republic,but also other imperial remnants too  we already know in legends that there was an imperial civil war, so why not take that and put that into canon?besides, stormtroopers and rebels may hate each other, but no one likes a heavily armed, belligerent,angry cultist,no matter what side you're on

i'm probably gonna get a lot of crap for this, but personally, i hope lucasfilm disney don't feel pressured to be 100  faithful to legends  

regardless of how you feel about the new canon, we know that the old eu was much less organised in comparison, so sometimes you'd get designs that look out of place in the sw universe, some that look simply terrible and at its worst, you get both  

specifically, i'm talking about things like 

    jedi (    why does this guy look like a mandalorian with jedi robes? stylistically, it looks like generic modern sci fi (  la halo or destiny) instead of something ralph mcquarrie or doug chiang would design  
   republic troopers (    they had more than a 1000 years of evolution to consider and the best they could come up with is something that looks like an advanced phase 2 clone trooper   
   darth bane (    this is probably the best example  the  new canon version ( we got is 100 times better than the weird power rangers villain they had in the old eu

716,starwars,"the rebel alliance are divided and some of their actions are worse than you think to the point that if you read tales from jabba's palace, did you believe boba fett was right about them not starting the war?

if they didn't, casualties would not have piled up to the likes of galen, saw, chirrut, jyn, cassian, bodhi,  baze, etc 

even though what he said was from legends, he is right since restoring the republic allowed more conflicts to rise up like the yuuzhon vong, galactic alliance guard, krayt's empire, first order, etc 

the republic may have gotten better but it keeps getting worse the moment another threat comes out 

heck boba fett believes that the empire brought forth the very order to the galaxy by exterminating the jedi and the republic's corruption and even if they had remained intact had palpatine were to be alive, he would have no problem handling the upcoming yuuzhon vong threat and whatever is coming to him  

the republic rebel alliance jedi should have just stayed quiet to the point that it would all be over in seconds thanks to palpatine

linear version that follows roughly the show 
this would start a little before chapter one  we follow roughly the same story (add a few more side quests if you re feeling it)  at the same time make it a customizable experience  if someone can fly the razor crest well enough then make it possible to avoid crashing on the spider planet from season 2  some larger choices would be things like choosing to shoot ig or not  the open world element would be traveling from planet to planet at will as well as large maps for each planet, similar to fallen order with a larger sandbox element 

new story, new hero 
make an open world star wars with either a different mandalorian or even a different character entirely  just make sure they re a loner in the galaxy, preferably a bounty hunter  add ship customization, armor swapping, and adding a scrapper feature would be fun  players could find old clone armor and  scrap  it to fit there overall look as well as an option to do the same with your ship

finis valorum was born into the influential house valorum on coruscant, the capital of the galactic republic, and was a descendant of the republic's first supreme chancellor

mon mothma was born into a political family  her father was an arbiter general in the galactic republic, and her mother was a governor on their homeworld of chandrila

bail organa was a politician and a member of the royal family of alderaan

padme was a queen

leia was a princess 

these aren't exactly rank and file in touch with the plight of regular people  

meanwhile, slavery and indentured servitude still existed and thrived under the republic  common people struggled greatly under the republic  

so instead of several elite wealthy people governing , they were replaced by one elite wealthy person in palpatine (who was also born into wealth)

and who paid the price for their squabbles? the poor and those born into service  

maybe the wealthy elite of the republic were just mad their power was usurped by one guy ",was the republic really any better than the empire?

784,starwars,"i ve seen a lot of people talking about how they don t like how rey and kylo ren were using force heal out of no where so i thought i would explain it  

force healing is a dark side power, and that s why it s not commonly taught or used by the jedi  force healing is also not a new power, it s first mentioned in episode 3  the ability to save people from dying palpatine spoke of was force healing  the only reason rey knows how to force heal is because she read the ancient jedi texts  those books where written long before the jedi had an anti dark side stance  the only reason kylo ren knows how to force heal is because luke taught him how 

luke tapped into the dark side on some occasions, like when he force choked jabba s guards, or when he crushed a dark trooper on mando recently  luke based his teachings on what yoda taught him, and what he learned from the ancient texts  

it also takes extreme amounts of power to be able to force heal  that s why kylo dies when he force heals rey, he never finished his training  that s also why we only know luke, anakin, palpatine, darth plagueis, leia, rey, and kylo had the ability or the potiential to force heal ",why rey and kylo ren used force heal

i ve been a fan of sw since i first watched anh in 1997, but it was always a casual fan, see the movies in the theaters, get the dvd s and just enjoy every now and again because it s star wars  there was no other reason really  

2020 was a lot  understatement  one plus side has been that it has allowed me to really explore my love for star wars  i m the kind of person that really gets into the lore of a galaxy like star wars, but due to my own insecurities i always kind of kept it to myself  

anyway, my roommate and i obviously watched the first season of the mandalorian, and he saw the love i have for this universe so he pushed me to kinda just be open about it  it s amazing how much your love for something even deepens when your encouraged to share that  

so this year has really shown me not only how special this franchise is, but also how communities like this subreddit are  how the fans really make you appreciate it and act as a lens to see the beauty in everything from the cinematography, to how shows like the clone wars  add to the main saga while expanding g the universe, to how you can start seeing recurring themes, moments, etc  its what i take george lucas to mean by when he said,  it rhymes   

it has made this year suck just a bit less and provided a point of joy, familiarity, and community to return to when we ve all felt alone this year  so thank you, i am grateful for all of you, and sw

860,starwars,"hey all 

so, i don't know about you guys, but since i was a kid i always wondered why the hell did vader fall when fighing luke in return of the jedi  i'm not talking about when luke kicks him down the stairs, but the moment right before he cuts off vader's hand  if you look that duel carefully you notice that vader kinda simply gives up for no reason and stays there with his saber rised up and doing nothing  

i think you could say that he was overwhelmed by luke's fury and that might be the canon explanation if by chance there is one, but i think that the actual reason was simply and unfortunately  bad coreography  or to say it better  bad coreography execution  let me explain why  if you look at the behind the scenes of that particular moment (that footage wasn't used in the final cut of the movie though) luke actually pushes vader on the railing and he falls becaus of being pushed naturally  i think that when they shot the actual scene that we got, mark hamill forgot to push vader aside, but david prowse fell anyway and for some reason they kept it like that 

there's actually the same ""problem"" in wrestling fights during the so called ""botches"" in which one of the two fighters behaves like he was hit despite the fact that the opponent accidentally didn't performe the move properly 

so what do you guys think? have you ever noticed this particular moment, or is it just me?",i think i know why vader fell when fighting luke in rotj

920,starwars,"  spoiler warning for the new trilogy, and the mandalorian  
 first ill point out the most obvious example which is palpatine coming back from the dead as a clone 

the old cannon had this very plotline except instead of using grogu's dna they used luke's  in my opinion using luke's dna makes even less sense as capturing luke seems way less believable than capturing grogu 

secondly we have the ""like the death star but bigger"" trope  this happened alot in legends a few notable examples are the star crusher, and star destroyers outfitted with deathstar laser's which is basically identical to what we saw in the rise of skywalker 

the fact is that the original trilogy did not have a good opening for additional content at least not revolving around the characters from the original saga 

i think that's one of the reasons why the mandalorian did so well as main movie characters are mostly kept to a minimum, luke only appears in one episode and by his time being brief it sticks to what is required for him to do  save the day, and take grogu for training 
boba fett is the only other movie character we see and he fits in because the format fits with his character 

combine these factors with the 30  years of expectations from fans and i don't think we could have ever had a super good new trilogy involving the original characters 

it's a hard pill to swallow but there's only so much you can do with the fairly final ending that rotj left us with ",alot of what people complain about with the new cannon was present in legends

i just don't think it's a good idea to make your primary antagonists feel like barely more than a speed bump to your heroes   we all know that plot armor exists, but a good writer director will be able to make the audience forget about it   this show frankly does the opposite   especially in season 2 

it's important for your villains to feel like a legitimate threat   as is, watching mando and crew fight a bunch of stormtroopers is like watching mike tyson beat up a kid with cerebral palsy ",does anyone else think the empire in the mandalorian is just a bit too useless?

  legends    order 66 is one of 150 contingency order for the gar, and the clones are shady from the start  they know their true purpose and willingly execute order 66  the clones have unquestioning loyalty and murder their jedi generals in cold blood  the clones are completely aware of their actions  

  canon    the clones are implanted w  inhibitor chips at the earliest stages of their development  when palpatine issues order 66, these chips activate and forces the clones to comply w  order 66  the inhibitor chips takes away the clones  agency and individuality 

  personal opinion    i prefer the retcon canon version as it's more logical  prior to tcw, the legends version made sense because the clones barely had any character development except for that they have ""unquestioning loyalty""  however, tcw has portrayed the clones as individuals who developed personalities, made decisions and defied orders they deemed wrong  the jedi and clones developed strong bonds as tcw progresses  also, it s cruel how the inhibitor chips takes away the clones  agency and individuality ",question   do you prefer the legends or canon version of order 66?

i couldn't find anything else about this, and i don't have access to the novel so i was wondering if any of you could confirm this occurance

morrison was excellent this season and did so much for that character, more than there's been done   it's not like he's just a guy in a cool costume, he has a history, a physicality and a voice and delivery that all give so much credence to that character  i was already enamored with fett this season, so it's going to be great to get more of him in general

someone mentions it might have something to do with either the german  troopenkorps  (or something like that   lucas loved german terms, like ' vader ' for 'father'), or maybe that it referred to who the troops were assigned to   which unit they're a part of 

like, say, the isb (agent kallus from rebels is isb 021), or, drumroll    tarkin 

tk   and the reason we hear so many tk troopers is because tarkin was governor and later grand moff of the entire outer rim (a huge part of the galaxy, where a majority of post yavin action happens)   and so i imagine it's not out of the question that the empire might have given tarkin's letters of 'tk' as the regional designation for the outer rim 

other far fetched theories of mine include more planet based designations   like, again in rebels, the troopers designated ls 515 or ls 005 might have stood for 'lothal service' 

 amp  x200b 

other designations include lrc    or mb       any ideas what those could mean ?",stormtrooper identification system (   i think)

1041,starwars,"in my opinion still one of the top 10 best multiplayer shooter games ever created  star wars jedi knight two combined elements or lightsabers, force powers, a variety of gadgets and blasters  especially since we saw the unveiling of dark troopers in star wars canon in the mandelorian  

single player stories was fun and interesting, following the journey of a former imperial operative turned rebel alliance mercenary, then his discovery of force sensitivity leading to a path to becoming a jedi  kyle katarn and jan (his counterpart) was the original operatives who stole the deathstar plans  they faced off against imperial inquisitors, the dark troopers project, imperial remnants trying to create force sensitive soldiers and cultists trying to resurrect ancient sith lords 

then when jedi knight two  jedi outcast was released  the multiplayer     just   wow, incredible and still one of the best balanced competitive multiplayer games ever created and could stand toe to toe with apex legends, overwatch, quake  all of the quick paced multiplayer shooters  team deathmatch, capture the flag was multidimensional and interesting due to the simultaneous use of force powers, lightsabers, weapons and gadgets  first person shooter switching back and force to third person lightsaber combat 

force powers were balanced neutral, lightside and darkside to choose from, blasting out force lightning, force pushing, pulling enemies off ledges or holding back flag runners, force choking and lifting enemies off deadly falls  blocking blaster bolts was automatic depending on if you weren't swinging around your lightsaber, different weights of use and attacking  simplistic lightsaber use no showboating lightsaber combo attacks (jedi knight 3 jedi academy featured some after also introducing double bladed or dual wielding lightsabers)  you could force throw your lightsaber like a boomerang 

then there were the weapons and gadgets like portable turrets, deflector shield screens, mines  then the weapons  the absolutely wonderful variety with secondary firing modes (personal favorite was the tl 50 imperial repeater with the secondary concussion blasts  btw ea  dice thank you for bringing that back in battlefront two! i was ecstatic seeing that gem )  force powers had offensive and defensive use in conjunction with weapons  i could force push away rocket launcher rockets or i'd fire concussion blasts at an opposing teams base and my buddy was propelling them further with force push, use ""force speed"" run circles around enemies while going full auto with my e 11 blaster  this game needs a comeback  especially with today's technology and physics  maybe even see what crazier simultaneous force power and blaster use can do with new physics 

not as clumsy or random as a today's games  an elegant multiplayer fps for a more civilized age    

i know a lot of us fans would love to see all this make a comeback  keep jedi knight as simple as it used to be ""with the exception of some new game engine tech for more destructible environments and world physics  keep it mostly the same 

i truly think the force sensitive mercenary kyle can be brought back  whether it's a ""fallen order"" situation of him becoming a merc or perhaps escaping the knights of ren's temple massacre further up the timeline and making a living as a mercenary 

favreau and filoni gave the fandom exactly what they wanted last season of mando, it's time star wars gaming gets the same love of being made by fans for fans knowing what the others want  if you want to microtransction different skins (weapons and characters), lightsaber hilts or beams  colors fine  nothing that unbalances the game and keeps it's original spirit ",we need a canocal reimagining of one of the eus most iconic hero's and a reboot of their games  i'm talking kyle katarn and sw  jedi knight

1053,starwars,"  revenge of the sith   7 10 

this was the first star wars movie i saw (brothers told me the first 2 episodes of the prequels suck so we skipped)  i thought it actually did make sense even without the context of the first 2  overall the movie was wildly entertaining, but extremely cheesy  i was making fun of anakin and palpatine for most of the movie and not really taking it seriously  i love obi wan though, he's hilarious  in general, this is such a fun movie, i get why people love it  


  rogue one   6 10

this could be a hot take, but i didn't find this movie to be that great  the main characters were just dull in my opinion, which sort of prevented me from caring about the story  it's definitely a lot more well made than revenge of the sith, just not nearly as much fun   i will say, the final 30 minute battle at the end of this movie is amazing  


  a new hope   9 10 

this is the movie that made me realize why these movies are popular in the first place  now i see why the originals are so much more beloved  the first 2 acts of this movie built up the intrigue to insane levels and i found myself hooked on star wars  han solo and princess leia were easily the best characters in my opinion and definitely carried the movie  i don't think luke by himself would be that entertaining as a main character, but i did love his escapades on tattooine and mos eisley  though i will say, the third act wasn't nearly as strong as the first 2 acts of this movie  


  empire strikes back   10 10 

this movie was amazing  han and leia, my favorite characters, had such epic banter through the whole movie, and their journey as fugitives from the empire was entertaining as hell  the scenes with luke did drag a bit in my opinion, but yoda was funny and made it work  once luke finally goes to cloud city the movie really picks up to a great 3rd act  i can't really think of any significant flaws with this movie, it's extremely air tight and the characters shine so bright in this  


  return of the jedi   6 10 

this might be a hot take, but i was underwhelmed by this movie  the jabba's palace sequence was cool, plus the final showdown between luke and palpatine   vader was awesome  however this movie felt sort of like a repeat of new hope, plus i felt a lot of the dialgoue just wasn't quite as snappy or clever, especially the scenes with han and leia  overall it's a decent movie and a good ending to the original trilogy, but they could have done so much more with this  


  force awakens   6 10 

this movie definitely had awesome visuals and set pieces, but right after watching new hope and return of the jedi it just felt like another movie where the heroes destroy the death star  i didn't particularly resonate with the characters nearly as much as i did with the characters in a new hope and empire either   


so yeah those are my thoughts on all the ones i saw  overall i definitely get the appeal of these movies, especially the original two movies  with that said, it seems like to me they sort of ran out of ideas a long time ago, and at this point are just cashing in ","just finished my first ever star wars marathon, here are my thoughts as a 25 year old who watched them for the first time"

1056,starwars,"after return of the jedi (new edit ending), we see anakin, obiwan and yoda together as ghosts   in the clone wars we learn that yoda is taught how to keep his spirit alive after death   we also see that yoda tells a young obiwan to learn this power while he's in exile   in the prequels, palpatine tells anakin he cannot learn this power from a jedi 

my question   has it been written, shown or proven that enough time elapsed between the transformation of anakin to darth and return of the jedi for palpatine to have taught him this power to make the ending of this movie plausible?

does this in any way make the completely ridiculous resurrection of princess leah possible?

i m just curious because i don t get it  it s always tlj and rian johnson but tros is just as bad  the whole movie is rushed, the plot is too fast paced and there s no logic or explanation behind random happenings whatsoever  it s not good as sw, but it also fails as a movie  and still every time when the sequels come up it s tlj s fault that the trilogy is bad 
at least the message of tlj was good (let the past die, and you don t have to be someone s relative to be strong with the force)  tros on the other hand totally lacks meaning  hux s and ben s turn came out of the blue, palpatine s return is so uncalled for (and he   the most powerful and feared being in the galaxy   dies in the most stupid way imaginable) and there s not one character arc that goes in any direction  but at least we learn that you can be good even as a force sensitive clone s daughter  oh and also the fanservice in the movie doesn t work at all 

so why is tlj getting more hate? because it was the first of the two bad movies? is that all? or is there something else i can t see?

i hope this didn t sound like a rant, it was not my intention, just looking for answers 
i wish everyone a happy new year, may the force be with you!",why tlj gets much more hate than tros?

1125,starwars,"very few people on this planet understand that star wars is very if not completely similar to what is happening here  next to that, since everyone is connected to the creational power of the universe (or force), i am 100  sure starwars universe is real, somewhere else in the galaxy, maybe another era  don't believe me? the galaxy is far too big for your human mind to comprehend the possibilities of it, yet it's very logical  resistance to believing this comes from you feeling like an ant on this planet, working for money and dying later  also being in a materialistic environment makes you blind to what really is happening 

many abilities that are described in starwars are 100  real  persuasion, telepathy, force push (aka tk), enhanced physical traits, clairvoyance, ""manipulating luck""  one of the greatest attaining eternal life, aka retaining your intact consciousness and individuality when dying and returning to the force, as you know a few jedi masters can do 

the force is real, here we call it something else, it's just a ""word"" to point out to something  basically, it is in everything as it is everything  light side, dark side, it's in all of you  and it's also selfish bullshit like the jedi's and sith's do, to argue their way as the only way  there is only the force, and nothing but the force  after that  you can use it as you like, it's completely neutral  jedi's and sith's are just like you guys, judging each other  but again, there is only the creative power that animates everything in the universe  things just are 

again, very few are aware of this, but i am  i wonder if there are other ""force sensitives"" here? i'm definitely born with a sensitivity to it and i'm sure i am not alone  i have really cool experiences with the force and i am here to push it even further, to the limit  also, ""force sensitivity"" is present in everything and everyone  as i have seen people debate on reddit if everyone can be a jedi 

i do know everyone has it in them, but what i do not understand is why others (like me) are way more in tune with it and willing to develop that part  all the rest of the people on this planet seem to sleep ","force sensitivity, fiction is reality  change my mind"

1128,starwars,,are there two different types of venators with different hangar bays?
1129,starwars,"i know with the new canon about inhibitor chips vs the old battlefront canon of following orders that there has been a huge debate about why the clones would turn on the jedi, but that's when i realized something  

what if the mistake we're all making is viewing things through our own moral lens  we find it unthinkable for clones who are friends of the jedi to kill them because death is horrible  but what if we were raised from birth to fight and not be afraid of death  what if the clones willingly killed the jedi, because in their minds death wasn't that bad  we see clones try their hardest to save their friends, but what if that is less about dying and more about fighting till the end  

if we actually take a second to consider how they were raised and their environment, then killing their friends and commanders makes a lot of sense  in their minds the jedi dying for the republic just isn't that big a deal  what if the real source of guilt (as seen in battlefront 2) is just the idea of shooting fellow soldiers breaking the command structure, and the murder aspect isn't even considered  i seriously wonder if the clones would mind in the slightest if they trained against each other with lethal rounds, so long as they did it with the idea of becoming stronger soldiers ",order 66 explanation

it begins right after kylo and rey finish fighting the praetorian guards  kylo makes roughly his same speech to rey, ""you are no one, but not to me "" he reaches out his hand   rey, conflicted, instantly knows how she feels about ben, but she also knows how she feels about what he has done  

(thinking to herself) ""no, he's a monster, he's done things that can't be forgiven "" she fights what she feels because she knows he has done things that would undermine her own identity if she permitted herself to overlook them    but something strange has happened in the time that they have shared in this inexplicable (force) connection    she now knows his mind as if it was her own  the force has bonded their souls into one  she can feel the very suffering, abandonment, betrayal, and rage that lead him to his actions  the sick jester of the rippling circumstances over which he had no control  this visceral pain sat with her like an old friend   it was a pain she was all too familiar with  she had known it as a dark passenger all her life, but never had the power to rectify it  who is she to say that if she had had the power kylo had had since birth that she would not have seeked similar retribution?

she now doubts herself    who she really is  her mind, her very identity, is now being crushed under the weight of this conflict  so much uncertainty, confusion, struggle, yet standing across from her    ben  she is utterly certain what she feels about ben  the crystalline shine of this diamond like clarity feels like ""the light"" compared to the turmoil she feels fighting its overwhelming allure   every fiber in her being wants to reach out to him  (in her mind) ""why am i fighting so hard to deny myself everything i have ever wanted   this     it  is  everything   ""

and it really is to a scavenger like her    her entire life she has been nothing to anyone else  she's never had a family, she's never had power or money, and here is a man reaching out his hand to her, offering her everything that she's ever wanted    love, companionship, power, an existence where she will never have to eek by on 1 4 rations again   all the things she used to lie awake at night dreaming of having are at her fingertips  now all she has to do is reach out    and take it   

hesitant at first, but then decisively, she takes his hand, ""ben"" they embrace in a passionate kiss  as if their whole lives have been a painful and confusing prison of suffering until this very moment, and in this kiss their shackles are dissolved  the scene then changes and they are in a bed chamber, ben and rey are shown to be making love, not in an exploitative way, but in a symbolic way of showing their bond being cemented in something they both never thought possible    complete and total acceptance 

fast forward in the film and the rebel base standoff scene is playing out similarly to how it played out in the movies  rey is now by kylo's side in the at at  luke is actually physically present, leaving shortly after rey left, realizing the mistakes he had made after speaking with yoda and wishing to rectify them  after trying to blow luke up with blaster fire and failing, kylo looks at rey, ""we can only defeat him if we stand together "" they go out to meet luke in the open and barren field  kylo confronts luke about his failures as a master and how he betrayed him  ""you made a mockery of your own teachings, trying to take my life as a boy before i even had the chance to live,"" luke says, ""i know it must seem that way, but i didn't mean you any harm "" rey jumps in, ""liar! i believed you on the island because i wanted to believe you, or in the legend of you    but now i have seen the truth of what you did, who you really are  i see it now as if through my own eyes, i know now that you were going to kill him   (luke) ""perspective can be misleading young rey, search your feelings, you know you have chosen the easy path"" (rey) ""shut up! i will not hear any more deceit"" (luke turns to ben) ""i know i failed you ben, i'm sorry"" (ben sarcastic anger) ""i'm sure you are!"" (rey) ""you betrayed ben, you betrayed the jedi, and now you've failed for the last time!"" 

at that moment rey springs into action followed closely by kylo and an epic lightsaber battle ensues  the battle is close but rey and kylo are slowly starting to overwhelm luke, for he is only a pale shadow of his former self  out of practice and old, luke struggles mightily, but even now is still able to defend himself and put up a valiant fight against the onslaught of the much younger foes  using bad ass force abilities to make up for his less than agile older frame, luke resists the best he can  try as he might, kylo and rey slowly push luke back toward the entrance of the rebel stronghold  at that moment, near the precipice of the entrance, right as luke looks as if he is going to be overwhelmed, seemingly out of nowhere, leia force leaps into the frame!

leia defensively engages rey and kylo briefly with her saber, kylo stops fighting stunned at seeing his own mother seemingly attack him  
leia briefly crouches down in a ball   summoning all of her energy and focus, along with all of the pain and sadness she feels seeing her own son try to kill her brother   the air swirls around her, suddenly it goes quiet    a moment of suspense as suddenly she floats in the air, stretches out her body, and cries out a blood curdling scream, unleashing an enormously powerful force push blast  

rey and kylo go flying back hundreds of feet  leia collapses from the exertion and luke quickly grabs her and pulls her into the base  they run half hazardly supporting each other toward where the resistance is hiding near the back of the entrance of the cave  luke then sets leia down and puts both his hands outstretched above his head    he summons all of his force energy in immense concentration, the mountain itself creaks and cracks dramatically but nothing happens   then, slowly, leia gets up   looks at luke and says, ""let's do this  "" they then work together to use the force to collapse the entrance to the base, pulling the mountain down on itself,  sealing the rebels inside, but more importantly, sealing kylo and rey out 

(leia says assertively) ""come on there has to be a way out,"" a resistance fighter yells, there's not we already checked!,"" and luke says, ""there has to be   you understand?  "" the resistance fighter nods nervously   realizing the gravity of the situation they are in   leia and luke then lead the resistance to the back of the base searching for a way out 

suddenly finn spots an ice coyote wiggling his way through some rocks   ""guys i think i found something!"" luke and leia come over to observe, (finn) ""we can get out this way, use the force to move the rocks!' luke and leia look at each other knowing they don't have the strength to move the giant boulders after their massive exertion   but before they can deliver the bad news there is a loud and blinding explosion   bang! once the dust settles to their surprise they see chewie waiting for them hovering low in the falcon   this whole time chewie had been systematically checking for weak spots in the back of the mountain to see if he could find a way for them to escape  chewie lands the falcon and emerges with a porg on his shoulder  the porg has ruffled feathers, looking discheveld and beside himself like it had just been though something traumatizing yet funny   chewie and luke embrace as the resistance loads into the falcon  chewie says something in wookie along the lines of, ""i knew you'd find your way back"" luke chuckles and replies, ""guess this makes it 3 times i owe you pal,"" they then all load into the falcon and speed off into hyperspace and the resistance survives to fight another day 

that's it, hope you enjoyed the read! go easy on me i'm not much of a writer, but i had fun making it  if theirs enough interest i'll write another one with my idea on how this story line would be concluded in the next movie  thank you for reading!",what if rey turned to the dark in the last jedi?

i first made it into a 10v10 moba, but couldn't find anyone to play test    so i figured to make a player base have a clash of clans experience so you can play without another person online   and that is where the game is now, building a base and a huge fleet   next update though is a vast mmo 

mmo traits  pvp everywhere, but if you're not flagged for open combat, you get a bounty on your head   too big of a bounty and you go to jail for a few hours or days   when you log in, you can talk to people who visit the jail, maybe smuggle contraband, but you can't talk on the global channel unless someone smuggles in a communication device for you   

you can buy and sell materials in different zones for trade runes  
 you can also get bounties for trying to buy and trade goods that are illegal if someone scans your ship 

there will be ""space dungeons"" each with different rule sets, like ffa, team, highlander, chess, capture the flag, kill pve, etc etc   every 30 minutes another space dungeon will have an awesome reward and you need to find clues to which one   then you compete with other players there too for a good reward   not everyone will win every time since of the different rule sets 

there will be wandering mobs, and quests and stuff   finally culminating with a never before heard of space opera where love game masters let you change the course of history with real choices

1248,starwars,"fandom hatred is one idiotic phenomenon which honestly infuriates me 

do not get me wrong, there are cases when authors creators get  unintended fans  of their work (such as  my little pony  friendship is magic ) and cases when people are only in the business of creating entertainment media for the sake of money, fame and  spreading of ideologies  without any actual care for the fans  there are even cases in which the original creators themselves have decided to make changes in their works which fans may disagree with (such as  the last of us ) 

with that said, who in their bloody right mind actively antagonises the people who are basically giving them money for watching reading playing their works?

i get it, it is impossible please everyone 

that said, it should be perfectly possible to be at the very least be civil logical towards people who have disagreements with your works  it should also be perfectly possible to treat the fandoms that you have gained (such as  the last of us ) or have inherited from others (such as disney inheriting star wars and marvel) with respect, care an understanding 

unfortunately, it is clear that some people cannot even exercise such basic human courtesy 

seriously, real fans only want the fictional works that they love to be enjoyable fulfilling sensible true  the last time i checked, most sane people do not appreciate being mocked or treated unfairly when they have actual reasons to be upset about a fictional work being handled poorly (such as the  disney star wars sequels ) 

to the people who hate the fandom because they refuse to blindly accept the unwanted changes in their beloved fictional works without putting a struggle, you are no better than egotistical tyrants who refuse to listen to the cries of their people fans ",the idiocy of fandom hatred (it is relevant to star wars given the issues over the past few years after the disney takeover )

1254,starwars,,not sure if it's been done before lmao
1255,starwars,"random question that i thought of while having another discussion   


in the mortis arc of clone wars, the characters encounter the planet mortis with the father, son, and daughter, powerful entities with tremendous command of the force   the son being almost a personification avatar of the dark side and the daughter of the light side, while the father seemed to be a balance of neutrality between the two, holding them in check   


at the end of the arc, he is on his deathbed   having already spoken during the arc as if he was going to die, he is mortally wounded by the son's machinations   the main characters then find themselves back on their ship, their clocks prior to the time they landed on the planet, in empty space with no planet mortis nor any evidence the events actually happened and weren't a dream or force vision   


it should be noted here that the imagery of the father, son, and daughter seems to be ancient among at least some force wielders, as artwork depicting the three was found on lothal at an ancient jedi temple, which eventually leads ezra to the portal of ""the world between worlds""   the artwork was ancient, but prevalent enough (at least in ancient ruins) that palpatine's historian recognized it and was able to describe it, even if admitting that the exact significance was unknown   


fast forward to star wars  rebels and the founding of chopper base on attolan   there, former jedi padawan kanan jarus meets a large, nature like being calling itself the bendu, saying that there were the sides of the force, such as the light and the dark, but ""i'm the one in the middle   the bendu ""  


he does not say ""those like me"" or ""my kind"" or anything that would suggest a general statement   while he could be referring to a class or order of being, we've not seen nor encountered any others of his kind or his order or his   philosophy?   to make that determination   


like the father, he seems to be some singular being, dedicated to a peaceful existence and balance between light and dark rather than using either   to the point he refuses to take either side when thrawn's imperial forces assault the rebels on the planet, and when called a coward by kanan, proceeds to become a storm and attack both sides   the only time he attacks only one side is when the rebels flee after he demands everyone leave his planet, leaving only the imperials for him to attack   


after a barrage of fire from thrawn's forces sends him crashing to the ground in corporeal form, he predicts thrawn's future defeat (even after being unable to predict whether ahsoka would die if she confronted vader), and claims he is beyond thrawn's ability to destroy when thrawn asked what manner of being he was   he then vanishes when thrawn shoots at the bendu's fallen form, only his laughter echoing, indicating he had not been killed   


   


while being arguably weaker than the father outright, the bendu was force neutral, and described himself, like the father, as a balance point between the two   like the father, he was extremely wise, and had an air of immortality, or, at least, very extended life and a desire for peace and not engaging with petty or lesser or trifling matters like   you know, a major galaxy spanning civil war   like the father, he did not seem entirely immortal, and had at once both a corporeal and ethereal seeming existence   and like the father, he seemed to be an enigmatic and singular being, an anomaly in the universe, somewhat akin to the character of tom bombadil in the lord of the rings (aule theories aside)  


note that i'm not saying the bendu was the father or anything   more asking the question if they could be   i dunno, ""of a type of thing"" or somehow connected, i guess?  or, perhaps, that the bendu could have been an incarnation or corporeal branch of the father or something   


while we do know the father was mortally wounded in the events on mortis, as mortis seemed somewhat  from time, we don't really know how long his death would have taken, or even when it would have occurred in the outside universe (similarly to how events in hyperspace are not exactly in sync with the normal realspace galaxy), so we do not know for certain if the father would be dead by the events of rebels, or if he was even killed at all, or any thing like that that would interfere with any potential connection with the bendu   


anyway, just wondering if anyone might have a thought or answer to the question   


oh, one other thing of note  apparently, an early name in the original star wars for the jedi was the ""jedi bendu""   take from that what you will ",could the bendu be some type of incarnation reincarnation of the father from mortis?

bravo to you guys for pulling this one off

1284,starwars,"for context, this all takes place in legends continuity 

i find it a bit strange that the republic and the jedi, despite having multiple battles on the planet, never sensed or realized that the planet s natives were force sensitive  going by the force unleashed, at least one of the battles took place in their territory 

i mean, surely the jedi would be very interested in a planet wide race of sentient beings that were all moderately strong in the force ",did the jedi order not know about jungle felucians being force sensitive?

i love all the star wars movies (and books, games, toys, etc ) but it feels like it s impossible to enjoy the franchise anymore  every time i log onto a star wars themed subreddit, the very first thing i see is how dumb half the fandom is  

i used to love interacting with this fandom  i ve earned upvotes from seemingly every subreddit   r starwars,  r prequelmemes,  r sequelmemes,  r themandaloriantv,  r galaxysedge, and even  r saltierthancrait and  r saltierthankrayt (yes, both) 

but reddit isn t a place for sharing praise and criticism now  what happened to the star wars fandom? whereas we once discussed a shared love for the series, today it seems like fandom is just a constant competition among the fans to show who can hate certain movies most vocally  

rock bottom was when i ve seen the mental health of sequels fans get attacked by other fans 

can we just    try to like what each other likes? not just keep ourselves to our subreddits in echo chambers, but try to share each other s likings?

 can t the ot diehards start to enjoy prequel lore?

can t the prequel memers try to enjoy the acting of the sequel actors and actresses?

can t we all just enjoy the mandalorian without attacking each other?

maybe i m being too wishful  but the message i got from star wars movies is that being hateful is ultimately self destructive ",i m so exhausted by this fandom  the endless sequel trilogy arguments are draining me

1  obi wan tells luke that his father didn't share the same ideals as his uncle, who wanted him to stay on tatooine  is this just one of the mistakes that happen when you make prequels 20 years after your original trilogy?
2  obi wan talks about vader hunting down the jedi, which i guess sort of works in terms of revenge of the sith, but also heavily implies that vader is a separate person from anakin  i understand there is supposed to be a distinction between the two (good version vs bad) but again, is this just something george lucas wasn't thinking about didn't know during the original trilogy?

prequels are insane because literally both sides are the dark side  there is literally no way to win especially with order 99  they get absolutely  demolished  then on top of that you have anakin become vader an even harsher even creation in the star wars galaxy  good side gets absolutely  wrecked  the good side gets wrecked  nearly all the time   luke had his win when he defeated vader  but that place didn't last long  at all  he made a training temple that got  urged to the ground i feel like twice?

1367,starwars,"i forget the name of the movie but the 2nd one of the new star wars is the best or the most interesting from a twists and turns defying convention point of view  the amount of things that can be analyzed is intense  for example in the final fight scene one of the red guys is about to stab the main character and in the next frame the knife suddenly just vanishes  them choosing not the do a re shoot of this scene leads me to believe that maybe this is one of rays new force powers and instead of holding the audiences hand in terms of explaining things they just let it happen and leave it open to interpretation  i have seen hema people claim the choreography is bad but i think they miss the point of the movie  they even show the luke to be a weak coward which subverts expectations so heavily from the originals that  i never saw it coming  one word, zany  another crazy unusual choice was the slow motion version of a chase scene  the ships following one another was like watching a car chase but slowed down and turned into the main plot  not something i expected  for one you think of well they can just launch some smaller faster ships or use long ranged weapons but then they don't and pay the price when the girl from blue velvet who is now purple turns into pure energy and becomes even more powerful than the jedi and sith combined  then you think that the luke will have this awesome showdown but theres a twist and he is actually a ghost before he even dies and then after that he dies  then there is a part where the director took some strong influences from marry poppins and has layer the main character fly through space using the force to survive which feels like it belongs in a different movie  scenes like this can be hilarious but i found a lot of the humor to be a lot less slapstick and more plot based, for example how they humorously mock the genre by pretending theres things like gravity in space  massive departure from the play it safe first episode  i left the movie feeling like the same people did not even make the first and second movies which i know would be insane  while i would say i enjoyed it i will probably not watch the next movie because i am happy with where the story ended  overall feel pretty satisfied with the villain defeated and the conclusion to rays story  my only mark against it though is i think younger audiences will have trouble with a lot of what exactly makes it so funny and good  i would like to know where the knife that was about to stab layer during the red room fight scene went though  maybe this will be explained in the persondolorian series ",been obsessed with episode two and it is now my favorite star wars

since jedi were the only threat to palpatine wouldn't other sith be aswell? after all sith aren't above killing other sith as everyone knows especially to gain power  in fact while the inquisitor program was formed in order to hunt down jedi survivors of order 66  while inquisitors were force users vader and sidious made sure not to give them any training in ways of the sith for fear that the inquistors would become too powerful and might even attempted to overthrow them both

now, i personally hate kathleen kennedy for ruining star wars  she thought rogue one was boring, that's an example of being stupid and not having good taste  the mandalorian was also the only good sequel  keep in mind, i'm a prequel fan, and i 100  agree with someone if they say the sequels were trash

i know it s star wars  i know this isn t some grade a action movie with the highest trained military in film history, but can we do a little bit better?

watching the ot, it was laughable how bad the storm troopers aim was  it s fun to look back on it because it s an older movie and with older movies comes things such as that  

but aren t we at the point where things can get a little more interesting? i m so sick of seeing every single bullet miss the heroes  i m sick of these troopers just stumbling along, not using any type of formation or tactics whatsoever  you have a galactic empire that can rule the galaxy but can t devote a little time to military tactics?

i know a lot of people don t like the prequels but this is what i miss most about them  i miss that field of jedis surrounded by thousands of droids, swiping away shot after shot in a matter of seconds  at that point it at least seemed like they were ridiculously skilled and not that the enemies were just damn morons

my list is long , but to be succinct for discussions sakes, my biggest problems are 

shitty character development  honestly don t give 2 shits about any of the newer characters  rey and ben have potential but are executed poorly  

they insulted the legacy of previous characters we all loved 

what they did to luke is unforgivable and not anything i believe we d expect from luke

bringing back palptine( especially with no damn good explanation) was just lame 

the plot holes, the obvious lack of story consistency or a outline for how it should go 

side characters were terrible  no, it has nothing to do with kelly marie tran being an asian woman or any of that shit  personally i love all the actors, she seems sweet as hell, daisy is a gem, domhall and oscar isaac are great actors, adam driver is awesome  i literally have no issue with the actors, their characters however, are weak and poorly written  i could easily keep going, but i want to hear why i m wrong or looking at it wrong  thanks!",question for fans who love tlj and tros

ok so probably bonkers theory but as we saw in the finale of mando s2 din gives grogu off to luke to be properly trained in the ways of the force 

so, thematically as mando gave luke his  son  for safekeeping i wonder if maybe mando s4 or some future finale episode see s an older luke (maybe 15 aby) giving his child to mando to keep safe from the growing threat he feels on the horizon (ben stoke sideous) 

yes i know there s no mention of any child in the st but let s be honest the backstories of anything before tfa were brief, glossed over and contradictory at best 

i could totally see filoni and faverau doing mara jade at some point and also bringing in some version of ben skywalker from legends (anakin skywalker ii in this version)  

so in my wild bonkers theory we see this future point at the end of the mando story when din is older and thinks his adventures are maybe over when he s contacted by luke  meeting him in secret luke says something like   as you once entrusted me with your precious child i must now ask you to do the same for me  keep him safe, keep him from harm, and above keep him away from the dark side  

the scene then ends in a parallel to s2 finale with old man mando with grogu by his side and a young child asleep in his arms 


this is basically because i think it would thematically be a nice touch but also i really wanted the skywalker line to continue through luke like in legends, and this seems the only plausible way to do it to line up with the st

1514,starwars,"what are your thoughts on mace windu taking up that role? do you guys think this would be milking the characters too much?

i'm a kenobi fan, and have read a good amount of books in the eu  i enjoyed the  a'sharad hett darth krayt spinoff  it makes sense, a jedi who survives order 66 goes home  he has a hatred for anakin and wants to kill anakin's son and turns to the dark side   

however, i think disney has done away with the eu and wouldn't fall specifically on that storyline  

here are some reasons why i think an epic battle between windu and kenobi could work 

 

  there are a handful of people in the galaxy who can challenge kenobi, and windu is one of them  to me, it seems even more uncreative to whip out a superpowerful being out of thin air  at best kenobi, is top 5 in the galaxy (yoda, windu, anakin, palpatine, vader) at worst, he was a master on the jedi council  either way, kenobi is definitely a top gun in the galaxy 

  windu doesn't have to be an official ""darth""  windu can be a jedi who turned dark and is therefore a sith 

  depending on how they do it, i would be okay with survival  darth maul was able to survive getting cut in half with his hate for kenobi, palpatine was able to survive being blown up in the death star  windu was a master of form 7 vaapad, so i could see one unexpected betrayal could have tilted him to hatred and keep him alive  

  maul turned out to be a reasonable character in clone wars and i want to see more of windu, so i wouldn't be too upset if he avoided death  maul was fueled by hatred revenge, so windu could be too  windu was more powerful than maul and a top force user, so he could have survived the force lightning (yoda got up and fought after a weaker shock)   terminal velocity drop trauma would be blocked by the force 

  dooku was a top jedi master who turned dark, so i don't think it would be unreasonable for windu to also, especially after being betrayed 

  this sort of plot would allow him to stay low, out of the eyes of the empire  or maybe kenobi somehow lays an elaborate trap and it's a windu vs vader finale  vader will be in jedi hunting mode around this time anyways 

  in the mandolorian, it is a regular person in armor, so ordinary obstacles are okay, but in kenobi, the villain has to be very powerful  

extra details 

   a tv show probably won't get into the weeds of lightsaber styles etc, but on a more detailed side, obi wan's style 3 could be a great defense against windu's shatter point vaapad  grevious's attack style was a sort of vaapad in its own way where it could find all the holes in the enemies  idk if it is canon, but grevious killed a jedi master in 1v1 in 20 seconds  (  

   if there is no attack anger to redirect, windu would have to approach it differently than vaapad (given, he is a master of all the styles its not a big deal)  in theory, if there are no weaknesses, then shatter point won't help  in the rots book windu says, 

""but surely, master windu,"" obi wan had said, ""you, with the power of vaapad or yoda's mastery of ataru "" mace windu had almost smiled    ""i created vaapad to answer my weakness  it channels my own darkness into a weapon of the light  master yoda's ataru is also an answer to weakness  the limitations of reach and mobility imposed by his stature and his age  but for you? what weakness does soresu answer?""   blinking, obi wan had been forced to admit he'd never actually thought of it that way  ""that is so like you, master kenobi,"" the korun master had said, shaking his head  ""i am called a great swordsman because i invented a lethal style  but who is greater, the creator of a killing form or the master of the classic form?""   rots book

  for people who think, windu would stomp kenobi, maybe kenoni has mastered his connection with the krayt dragon and will just tell it to eat windu 

ps  i just realized darth krayt is named after the krayt dragon

durge knows many ways to kill mandalorians and the darksaber has to be the key to push them to the cliff before they face mass extinction 

even as a pretender to the throne can mandalorians be put under fear to the point durge would swiftly execute them in a slight breeze 

maybe the mandalorians can change their minds after all of this and accept the new ways that din, jango, and boba went through 

after all durge would put all mandalorians and pseudo mandalorians unite together to defeat a common threat in order to dethrone him to pave way towards a new era  

i bet s3 will feature the imperials as a lesser threat as if they were to hire durge, he will pretty much steal the show since his ties to his hatred for the mandalorians makes it a focal point overshadowing the imperials 

or if durge doesn't make it, an expy can taking all of his traits and project durge making it the durge of disneyverse

1541,starwars,"alright, so i watched the originals and the prequels when i was so young i did not truly understand what was going on in these movies  now i've decided to watch the movies again, and there have been a few questions i have been asking myself that come from all the star wars talks i've read over the years, so here goes  btw if these questions have already been answered, i am sorry, and feel free to remove my thread, i'll get my answers some other way!

1  why do the prequels get so much hate? i know people talked a lot about the conversations anakin has with padme as being bad or stuff, but what i see is a 19 years old boy who was originally very close to his emotions (in episode 1 with his mother, he was always a very empathic and loving child), who then got told to repress his emotions the become a jedi, by being trained by obi wan who was actually training him because of his emotions for his late master, from what i have been seeing, obi wan is terrible at controlling his emotions as soon as anakin or his master is involved  he also keeps talking about how he ""hates"" things  also, anakin shows a very high respect for senator palpatine, who keeps telling him that he will become stronger by embracing his emotions  these emotions are clearly shown when he meets padme again, and for a kid who never had any dating advice or experience, it makes sense that he looks like a real fool speaking to the love of his life  

2  i might be wrong here, but aren't the jedi masters a bit hypocritical (and is maybe one of the things that were supposed to be understood but i just now understand), luke was a very emotional person, but had a clear mind and could stay calm in moments he needed, which helped him control his powers, but his emotions actually made his powers much stronger? yoda is another with whom i noticed this, in ep5 when he is training luke, he keeps arguing with obi wan, and keeps dodging lukes questions, which makes me feel like he is experiencing sadness fear but tries to repress it infront of luke, but the fact that he does have those emotions and lives them makes me think that is why he is such a powerful jedi  this would mean that they are purposefully training sub par jedis because of their fear of having people get angry and realize how powerful those emotions are, but if they could use their love and empathy instead they could be far more stronger all while staying attuned to the light side?

3  why were people upset about the message heard from emporia palpatine in the new episodes being something that happened in fortnite and not any official sources? the beginning introductions in all the movies seemed to talk about bits that did not make it in the official star wars media, so why was that one such a controversy?

4  is there any easy to access shows books or anything else that goes more into side stories such as the mandalorian? heard there was a yoda ark in the clone wars series, is there anything else like that?

1  sheev palpatine is the most ingenious state crafter i have ever seen! for example, his investment into an obedient clone and droid army to start off his influence then to win the support of many human to be recruited across the galaxy is a great way to secure the loyalty of his state security apparatus 

canon and legends provide numerous examples of his cunning and brilliance

   why palpatine ( kept the senate around  (
   what was palpatine's ( ultimate endgame?  (
   why did palpatine ( kill his master who brought him to power? (

key questions 

  was palpatine's 157 year rule impressive? why?

1552,starwars,"here s my personal pitch for a luke skywalker series on disney 

the series begins shortly after the mandalorian season 2, luke has just begun training grogu as his apprentice, although luke won t start his jedi academy for another 6 years in 15 aby (which allows this show to run for 5 6 seasons) luke, grogu and r2 d2 are traveling around the galaxy learning the history and culture of the jedi, we see luke gather the 8 sacred jedi texts seen in the sequel trilogy and learn more about what s in them  we can even show the first meeting between luke and lor san tekka, hell, maybe even bring in ashoka for an episode  luke is being guided on this long journey by anakin s and yoda s force ghost, i d love to see a meeting between yoda and grogu  

the first antagonist of the series would be mara jade,  let me explain, in this timeline mara jade would have been a secret apprentice to the emperor, not even vader knew, kinda like starkiller in a way  she was trained to either avenge his and vader s death or become a replacement for vader should he die, although the emperor didn t prefer her over luke  she s out for revenge against luke for supposedly killing the emperor and vader, eventually she turns to the light side and becomes a jedi  since this show would run for 5 6 seasons we would have plenty of time for this character development  her and luke can get married or stay separated, it s complicated, maybe they did get married but she died in the fire, or maybe they stay separate, let me hear your ideas on this subject 

the series would end with luke (and maybe mara jade) establishing a new jedi academy, we can even feature a young ben solo, a de aged han and leia, and chewbacca at the opening of the academy ",my pitch for a luke series

1607,starwars,"so, we've all heard this discussion a million times before, but like my buddy m  night said   but wait, there's a twist 

i'd like to be open and honest with something first  i think rey is a mary sue character, and a lot of what was done in rise of skywalker was making up for a lot of lost time that they simply did not have  but that's not the important thing here  

here is the twist   

see, i think star wars canon is robust enough for both rey and original older luke to coexist  i think that diverging timelines should definitely be a thing, but that's ultimately down to disney  

the galaxy is a big place, it can host luke and ahsoka and rey in it if it wants, as well as all of the nonbinary and transgendered characters necessary  (hey so ya'll realize palpatine was trying to lowkey become transgendered, right? like him going from old man to young lady was like      a thing     yerr ) 

what this galaxy can not host however      is empire like behavior masquerading as rebellion  

harassment is not cool 

calling everything you don't like ""sjw""  and going off on a rant about how they are ruining everything is not cool  

calling every female character a mary sue without seriously considering the reasons for it is not cool 

being an ass to people for sharing their emotions over a powerful moment that reminded them of their childhood hero that helped them survive cancer is not fucking cool  

not every piece of work regarding star wars is going to be for me and that is okay  

i don't have to like everything sw does and that is okay 

i'm allowed to like what parts of sw are acceptable and that is okay

1619,starwars,"i want to preface this by saying that this is just my opinion  i tear up every time i watch it because of how magnificently executed it is 

maybe it's the events that lead up to it that already put me in such an emotional state  anakin asking luke to remove his helmet so that he can see him with his own eyes, anakin telling him to go, luke wanting to save his father so badly  he knew anakin had redeemed himself and that he was enslaved by the dark side and palpatine in many ways 

 the funeral itself is beautiful, sad, and poetic all at the same time  it's extremely sad because only luke attends while the rest of the galaxy celebrates vader's death and the fall of the empire  this all happens in spite of anakin redeeming himself  luke viewed his father as a hero in his final moments and chose to honor and respect him for his bravery when it counted most  the burning of vader's suit in a way signifies the end of story of vader anakin  it also is a great callback to what created vader (physically)   binary sunset playing in the background is simply perfection, john williams makes everything better  the lack of dialogue is extremely powerful  what could luke have said? what can one say after such an experience  luke knew the truth, and that was more than enough  he laid anakin to rest knowing that he had fulfilled his destiny 

no matter how many times i view this scene it will always bring me to tears",vader's funeral is the best scene in all of star wars

1636,starwars,"star wars theory is a canadian star wars youtuber who created his channel back in 30th july 2016 and has since then made over 1800 videos registering 778 million views 

on the 22nd december 2018 he published  ""vader episode 1  shards of the past   a star wars theory fan film"" which has gained 22 million views and caused him to gain worldwide fame  he regularly creates lore videos along with breakdowns of all the new star wars i e mandalorian and clone wars  he also has a podcast rule of two where he and the collider owner marc fernandez discuss all things star wars occasionally bringing on guests including ashley eckstien and sam witwer

now onto why i dislike him (i will try to b e as objective as possible presenting only facts)

  clickbait   now there is nothing inherently wrong with clickbait as long as you stay honest  a line which he crosses  his content consists a lot of theories but he titles the videos in a way that makes his theories seem like they are confirmed news    cal kestis saves grogu in the mandalorian season 2   star wars theory  ,   anakin saved grogu during order 66   star wars theory  ,    mace windu's return in the mandalorian season 2   star wars theory    whilst the word theory is present in these titles that is so when you search his channel name, these videos pop up  nowhere is it said that the yare unofficial or fan made etc  this is part of a larger problem on youtube of putting a channels name in your title to grab their viewers   he has 183 videos that do just that  star wars theory's star wars explained playlist (
  canon   now a lot of modern day star wars on youtube revolves around the new canon, anything released post 2014 through the lucasfilm licensing program  he used to make videos where it was implied they were canon (i e he used pictures of them from canon but talked about legends stuff) but that has stopped now  something he still does however, during videos discussing things that are canon, which he very clearly made sure we knew that it was canon, he will commonly refer to a legends idea concept as the crux of his argument  for instance in a video about grogu he said that it's yoda and yaddle's son as in legends ki adi mundi was able to breed in order to save his dying species  this was showcased on multiple occasions in the star wars republic comic series that ran from 1998 2013 is some form or another
  manipulation of viewers   this one cannot be supported by facts but merely context and observations  when swt made his vader fanfilm, it was claimed under grounds of copyright infringement by warner tamerlane publishing corp who license the music for star wars  this was because he included a sample of imperial march in his product  at the time the film was not monetised but that doesn't mean it wasn't copyright infringement  he started a campaign asking disney to reverse their claim  he said he just wanted them to remove the adds   something they could still do whilst the video was claimed  after a 'public' outcry and borderline harassment to disney but specifically certain employees (kathleen kennedy and the usual suspects, you know who i mean) and the twitter operators  in the end, presumably to avoid more drama they reversed the claim and apologised  since then it has been more of the same  playing victim, urging people to fight his battles and by not discouraging and behaviour, indirectly endorsing it and after getting what he wants, defends himself again by saying he didn't want thus  as these keeps on happening it is hard to believe that he doesn't wish this as there are many things he could do stop this from becoming harassment and cyberbullying  there are many other examples of him clearly tricking his viewers that i could bring up but that is not what i am here for 

  pablo hidalgo controversy   

the grounds for this recent pablo hidalgo controversy is one tweet, out of context that cannot be viewed due to his account being private  giving swt the benefit of the doubt that he didn't realise it could actually mean anything, after having been criticised by many people (lfl and ea employees along with news journalists, all who pointed this out) you'd think he would at least acknowledge his possible lapse in judgement, which he hasn't  today he published another video on this issue where he, marc fernandez and denofnerds have brought it up again, stirred on more of the hate on, proving he will not back down  why would he do this? well controversy benefits the accuser most of the time no matter the argument and it's validity  take tatty who accused james charles of being a sexual predator, claims which were all rebuked with strong evidence  she gained 5 million subscribers through this whilst james lost 3 million  this shows a motive to do what he is doing, one that isn't purely protecting his reputation  

  verdict  

theory is someone who i used to respect but since his breakthrough has fallen down a dark path so to speak  i am not evaluating him as a human being but rather the content he puts out and the way he presents it  he has shown signs of exploitation of channels established reputation and fans along with seemingly intentionally causing headline seeking drama and controversy",why star wars theory deserves the criticism he is getting

the first order remnants of the empire being under grand admiral thrawn turns out to be him amassing as many in his fleet as possible as the yuuzhan vong have been attacking the outer rim planets  

in the first film, his troops are defeated and he sends a message to leia etc of the republic much as she sent to obi wan, you must help we are going to be defeated  meantime we get grand master luke and he's come across and training rey and finn, similar backgrounds, and we have him also training ben  they're the oldest and most trained students but there are lots of others from all manner of species  the first film ends with them heading out to meet the empire remnants knowing it could be a trap 

in the second film, a lot of death a lot of losing  we end up with thrawn showing he's a great leader but with luke, rey, finn, and ben they're all pushed back and losing badly  luke steps out to hold off thousands of them showing epic use of the force like we all wanted to see but is overcome finally and does the legends force light one with the force and a massive bright light emits as he takes them out at the cost of his life and joins obi wan, his father, and yoda 

the third film is about rey, finn, and ben coming together with thrawn's strategic leadership to end the yuuzhan vong threat and leave the galaxy in a hard won peace

1688,starwars,"i have been thinking about this for a while   
i would really like jon favreau and dave filoni to make a new trilogy or series about the mandalorien wars, and i actually think there are few hints in the mandalorian that would make this seem possible  though, i know that there are some problems 

the mandalorian brought back a bit of the eu into star wars  mandalore the great was mentioned and the mandalorian wars  i think dave and jon are trying to set something up by bringing this up in the series   
plus in my personal opinion the potential is great and it would set a new tone for star wars in general 

what i mean is, that star wars was always, in every movie and series, somewhat connected to the skywalker family  everything was taking place in these years  but, the kreative potential of the skywalker family is mearly exhausted cause of the sequals  therefore i think to keep star wars going we need to break out of the skywalker franchise  thats what is beginning with all these new series announced  but there will be new movies in the future and i dont think it is a good idea to go on with rey  her story is not what you would call a classic open ending  eventhough it is possible that there will be something about her in the future, i think it is not so important or imminent right now to continue her story 

the biggest problem for a triliogy about something else than skywalker is that the fanbase in star wars is pretty split in the ""nerds"" (i would consider myself as one) and casuals  the casuals are important for the prosperity of the movies  and i think that for many ""casuals"" star wars is skywalker and thats why its hard to make new movies not connected to skywalker in the first place 

though i think that the skywalker franchise doesnt give much more for new movies  and i think dave and jon think that too and therefore they are trying to set a new tone for star wars fans and to sensitize them for something new not directly connected to the skywalker franchise with the mandalorian 

it is possible that in the future we may see star wars in movies or series that is not directly connected to the skywalker saga

1722,starwars,"generally speaking regardless of what people think about the movie  rogue one  overall, most people seem to agree that the darth vader hallway scene was amazing  save for a loud minority 

 amp  x200b 

usually, this wouldn't bother me, because there will always be a loud minority  but combining the facts that one of the members of this loud minority is none other than comic book reviewer on youtube linkara (aka lewis lovhaug), and that the loud minority seems to always miss the point of the scene? i feel like speaking up about it 

 amp  x200b 

whenever these haters criticise the scene, they strawman people who love it as people who just think it ""looks cool"" and is a ""badass display of vader's powers"", and that therefor there is no point to it because we have already seen vader display his powers and we don't need to see more  except, that's not supposed to be the appeal to the scene  that's not even the intention the director had with the scene if you ask him about it  i'm sure some people out there are dumb enough to just think of the scene like that (i'm looking at you, doug walker aka nostalgia critic), but i can only speak for myself and the intent of the scene   


the thing is, the whole point of the scene is that it's supposed to feel like a horror movie  it's supposed to be terrifying  we have never seen how ordinary people in the star wars universe views darth vader when he appears  not quite like this at least  because at this point, siths and jedis are seen as mythological figures  most people have never seen a sith or jedi at this point, let alone darth vader  so when they are stuck in this dark hallway and this very dark figure appears with a red lightsaber, they freak out and panic   


to them, vader must appear like death personified to them  what impacted me the most with this scene is how these experienced soldiers who are in life threatening situations all the time, suddenly lose all their rational thoughts and just panic, to the point of one of them slamming hard against the closed door desperately shouting    ""help us ""  

regularly, he'd probably say something like    ""we can't get out and are in danger, we are in need of assistance!""  

but no, not this time  as far as he is concerned, a demonic being of unknown mysterious powers is in there with them to ruthlessly kill them without saying a word, and he is terrified beyond rational reason 

 amp  x200b 

another thing haters like to point out is that either vader wouldn't do this, or he could have just easily grabbed the chip if he wanted it so easily  except, vader obviously would be sent out himself to protect the plans to the death star  as for the other point, both  rogue one  and  a new hope  make it very clear that vader doesn't really give a crap about the death star, and is just onboard with it out of respect for the emperor and tarkin  not to mention, vader is in constant pain to be more of a ruthless killing machine, and this is his way of releasing that anger  because he of course is still mad at the rebels for doing this, and he just wants an excuse to go berserk 

 amp  x200b 

now, it's still fine if people don't like the darth vader hallway scene in  rogue one  for whatever reason  but it feels like people like linkara do not understand why it's a great scene, and he is strawmanning people who love it for just being mindless idiots just wanting to see vader kick ass  i'm more than sure some fans are like that   but i'm not one of them, and i love and admire this darth vader scene for it's intended purpose ",defending the darth vader hallway scene in rogue one from haters

    light freighter      anything from a heavy shuttle to a pirate corsair (examples   the millennium falcon ,  rogue one  and  the mouldy crow   c66  consular )
    medium freighter transport      basically true merchant cargo hauler or passenger ship (example   gorzanti   class transport  gr 75  nubian j type)
    corvette      heavy gunships and raiders (examples  c70  charger , cr90  blockade runner  and cr92a  assassin    sphyrna   class)
    frigate      escort ship optimised for ship to ship and anti starfighter mission (example   nebulon  series,  pelta   class)
    light cruiser      basically identical to frigates with overlapping tonnage but generally more heavily armed and sometimes with bigger fighter hangers (example   arqutiens   class,  carrack   class)
    heavy cruiser battlecruiser      pre clone wars biggest warship type optimised for ship vs ship combat (example   dreadnought   class  mc 75a   munificent   class,  victory   class)
    carriers      proportionately lightly armed and massively variable in size (examples   quasar fire   class   ton falk   class   venator   class)
    star destroyer star cruiser      carrier battlecruiser hybrid, tend to be 50 100  larger than battlecruisers (examples  mc 80a,  imperial  series)
    star dreadnought star defender super star destroyer      super sized sector command vessel intended to be able to outfight any given foe and besiege entire systems unaided  originally considered somewhat over vulnerable and mostly defensive (examples   executor   class   mandator   class   viscount   class)

the thing about star wars cap ship classes is that type designations are assigned based on role, not tonnage  so, we have, for example, the  munificent , which is basically a heavy cruiser, called a 'frigate' because the banking clans marketed it as a convoy escort, and 'star destroyer' ranging from the  victory   class (which was barely larger than the  dreadnought ) to the  resurgence , which is nearly twice the length of the  imperial   class

 later, anakin killed master windu when he was going to kill palpatine and allowed palpatine to survive  which allowed the republic to transform into the first galactic empire and put the sith in control of the galaxy  

one contrary point is that anakin reveled to the jedi that chancellor palpatine was a sith lord, but the council of jedi would have understood that sooner or later and foiled his plans of overthrowing the republic  

so if qui gon jinn hadn't chosen anakin from tatooine there was somewhat a chance that the republic would stay intact and the jedi council would still exist

tlj on the other hand actually took risks and tried to be different from the original films  the movie wasn't perfect, and did have problems, but it also did a lot of things right as well 

rey starting out as a nobody, and kylo ren choosing to forge his own path were actually great and interesting things  

also having watched rian's other films like knives out and looper, he's a far better director than j j  abrams  

the best way to describe abrams's filmography would be stealing ideas from other films, and surface level nostalgia  the nostalgia is simply used to hide the fact he can't think of an original idea

1898,starwars,,my 8 inch cheese steak is bringing balance to the force
1899,starwars,"  introduction    quite recently, i have decided to take up reading the star wars legends books from the new republic era on  this was something i never thought i'd do due to the immense volume of content, but watching the mandalorian has made me crave more post rotj content, and unfortunately there just isn't that much of it in the new canon  since i'm doing it, i decided to document my progress on reddit and spark some discussion about the older content  thus, with only a little further ado, here are my thoughts on various aspects of x wing  rogue squadron    spoiler warning    i've already got a few of the books in the series under my belt, so there may be some spoilers not only for this specific book but for some of the other x wing books as well 

  synopsis    the book follows wedge antilles as he attempts to put together a new rogue squadron, one that will live up to the legends of old but also maybe not die so much  most prominent among these new heroes is corran horn, a former member of the corellian security force who was forced into hiding to escape from kirtan loor, an imperial intelligence agent who, incidentally, has made it his life's work to track corran down  with his new squadron at his back, wedge helps the new republic take a major step in the fight against the empire by capturing the planet of borleias, a move which will allow the republic to stage an invasion of the imperial capital of coruscant, which, in the wake of the emperor's demise, is controlled by the head of imperial intelligence, ysanne isard 

  the good    honestly, there's a lot to love in this book  wedge and corran are both great characters, and watching them grow and change over the course of the book (and the series) has been a lot of fun  corran's arc in this book is a relatively simple one, but not unsatisfying  from his early conversation with lujayne and the groups first training mission, it is clear that his arc is about moving past old prejudices, learning to trust his new comrades, and putting his ego aside for the greater good  this all comes together towards the end when, in parallel to that first training exercise, he and wedge take the first run at the target they need to destroy with the intention of transmitting the targeting data back to the others if they miss  corran is able to put aside his ego, his desire to be the hero, and take himself out of the fight, trusting his comrades to get the job done  

wedge's journey, on the other hand, is a little more complex  his is an arc about coming to terms with loss and learning to embrace his new squadron emotionally even though he might lose them  this is primarily represented by his relationship with corran, and the pain he feels upon leaving him behind on borleias  while he thought he had walled himself off from his new team, corran managed to slip past those walls and become a dear friend much like biggs, porkins, and the others that rogue squadron had lost over the years  when corran is revealed to be alive after all, i think that really cements for wedge that it's okay to care about these people, to let them into his heart even if that might mean pain down the line  

as for other characters, the book is somewhat hit or miss, but i'll stick to the hits for now  mirax terrick is great, and her budding relationship with corran is handled very well  erisi, too, is well handled, and you can already sort of sense her true loyalties (though that may just be me projecting since i immediately spoiled that plot point for myself when i looked her up on wookiepedia to see what she looked like)  tycho is probably the last of the truly interesting characters here, at least on the good side  both loor and isard are smart, compelling villains, and isard is genuinely kind of scary, at least at this point in the series  as for tycho, the question of whether or not he's an imperial agent makes all of his actions more interesting, and wedge's faith in him makes us, as the readers, want to have faith in him too  aside from them, nawara ven, ooryl qrygg, and bror jace are somewhat interesting, but they don't really have much to do 

the story and action are probably where the book excels the most  stackpole's starfighter sequences are fast paced and compelling, though i often have a hard time following them  they're sort of like r a  salvatore(author of the drizzt do'urden forgotten realms series, as well as one of the new jedi order books)'s  fight sequences  they are rendered in exacting detail, but my brain struggles to process them  i feel as though this is a failure on my part, though, rather than failure on the part of salvatore or, in this case, stackpole  stackpole is also great at balancing wins and losses for the rogues  he rides a fine line for both sides of the conflict where the central figures (the rogues and isard loor) can take losses but still seem competent, like the first battle of borleias, which went wrong by no fault of the rogues, or the attack on talasea, which would likely have ended much differently had derricote listened to loor  this balance is one that stackpole manages to maintain throughout his run on the series, and it makes for a very compelling narrative  

  the bad    the only real complaint i have is just how little many of the characters have to do, and how little development they get  given that fear of loss is one of the biggest motivators for wedge in the book, it's odd that more time isn't spent trying to develop the characters who die  lujayne gets a little bit of development, but even then it's not really enough to make me care when she died  adoorni hui barely says or does anything, and peshk vri'syk literally doesn't  i don't think he says a single thing or is described in any level of detail  granted, stackpole is working with a lot of characters here, and it can be hard to balance them all, but as wraith squadron demonstrates later in this series, it is absolutely possible to get you to care about a squadron's worth of characters very quickly  as the series goes on, it becomes clear that stackpole is more interested in some of the characters surrounding rogue squadron than he is in some of those who are in it, and while this is absolutely fine, it just seems a waste not to at least invest a little bit of time in getting to us care about each of the rogues  nawara and ooryl don't have much more to do in this book than characters like adoorni or peshk, but they both have distinct personalities that endeared me to them very quickly  i just wish there was a little more of that for the rest of the squadron  

  conclusion    all in all, this is a solid start to my legends journey  corran has very quickly become one of my favorite star wars characters (please, please bring him into the rogue squadron movie!), and wedge is no slouch either, though i was already pretty familiar with a version of him from the aftermath books in the new canon  while i did have a few complaints about the treatment of some of the characters, stackpole definitely does get better as time goes on in that regard (though i don't think he ever quite gets to the point that allston does so effortlessly and immediately in wraith squadron)  that being said, stackpole is a great story teller, and this book definitely made me glad i gave legends a chance  anyways, i'll see you all in the next post and or the comments of this one  au revoir!","my trip through the legends new republic books, part one  x wing  rogue squadron"

this, to me, the terms ""new generation"" and ""future era"" suggests that the film will be set after  the rise of skywalker  

however, i've seen arguments that it's set across the galactic civil war because they use the t 65 x wing in the logo 

i've also seen arguments made for the period between  return of the jedi  and the battle of jakku like the  alphabet squadron  and  aftermath  books 

or that the film is around the same time as  the mandalorian , however i feel that niche (fighter pilots) will be filled by rangers of the new republic 

so, when do you think it's set?

1949,starwars,"i ve been doing some research and found out many details about the original plans for the sequel trilogy from the 1980s, these plans were made when lucas was still making the original trilogy, episodes 4 and 5 were the same as we got in real life but episodes 6 9 were completely different 

episode 6 s main, but not only villain would have been boba fett and featured the gang trying to save han solo from fett  han solo would have died by the end of the film because harrison ford would not return for any more films  leia was going to be a solo monarch presumably over other survivors of alderon  luke would have a showdown with vader, it s unclear if vader would have survived, although i doubt it  luke and leia were not related in this version but it would setup luke having a twin sister 

episode 7 would have shown luke begin rebuilding the jedi order and the rebuilding of the rebuilding of the republic, the latter of which would have been a main theme for the whole trilogy 

episode 8 would introduce luke s twin sister, who in this version was not leia, but a completely different character 

episode 9 would have been the finale with luke facing off against the emperor, who would have been pulling the strings from behind the scenes the whole time, the emperor would have been hiding off at the edge of the galaxy  it would have jumped forward one hundred of years and reveal that r2 d2 as the narrator of star wars, r2 was narrating it to the keeper of the  journal of the whills 

r2 d2 and c 3po would have been the only characters to be appearing in all of them, in 1988 lucas mentioned that luke would have had a romance with a female partner

part i  the twisted quest

at 40 bby on the planet kamino a small starship arrived called ""the shade"", this ship is able to blend in every area and is also avaiable to sail on water surfaces , and to dive underneath the water surfaces at the deep bottoms of oceans, lakes, etc 

the ship landed on a small landplatform with a small old village attached to it, on the surfaces of the water planet, the weather is as always very stormy  a gate on the starship opened and a tall silhoutte appeared, the silhoutte was walking slowly out of the ship  this person wore a long black cloak 

the cloaked figure walked at the footpath wich was located through the middle of the road, all the vehicles who drove past the cloaked figure took a look at the figure but then drove out of fear accelerated further away 

the figure entered an old inn called ""the big bith"", at the entrance of the inn the figure  his hood and revealed his pale otollan gungan face  the crowd took a short look at the gungan, but they weren't really afraid  the gungan walked further in the inn and walked towards an aged bith bartender at the counter of the inn and said ""i need a room"", the bartender took a weird look at the gungan because he didn't spoke like a a gungan, but talked like a regular person with a low voice, but the bartender answered anyway and said ""i'm sorry sir, but we're full ""  the gungan got angry and said ""there are still rooms avaiable, and you will give me one""  the bartender couldn't resist his words and said ""there are still rooms avaiable and i will give you one "" upon which the gungan answered ""good, you will give me room 3 and give the next jedi quarren visitors the same room as me and won't tell them about me""  the bartender answered ""i will give you room 3 and give the next jedi quarren visitors the same room as you and i won't tell them about you""  the gungan answered silently ""pathetic mind"", and walked to his room, the bartender looked confused to the gungan and saw the next visitors coming in and it were the very persons the gungan described 

the jedi quarrens wore jedi robes with their lightsabers attached, they were were looking for a sith from wich they heard rumors of, the first quarren was an aged jedi master and the second one was still a young padawan  the look of the two quarren looked very similar, they had a brown skin color, the only difference between them was just the height  they were walking towards the counter of the inn and the old jedi master said ""i'm looking for a room for me and my son, just for one night "", the son continued ""we're looking for someone called "", the old master interrupted his son on an agry tone ""he doesn't need to know that, profogo""  the bartender answered ""you are lucky, there is just one room left, room 3"", the jedi master thanked the bartender, gave the credits and went to his and his padawan's room  when they arrived at the door of their room the door was slowly opening with a loud creak, profogo looked frightened to his master, but his master eased him  when they stood at the entrance of the door, they saw a lamp enlightened figure looking through the window to the waves of the wild kaminoan oceans  the figure stood with his back to the master and his padawan and said ""domanos, profogo, what a suprise, so your son is finally allowed as your padawan, that took a while""  the jedi master, domanos replied with an angry tone ""that's none of your business, we've been tracking you since naboo, now you'll finally pay for your crimes you did to the republic and it's people, darth tibos""  the gungan replied ""unfortunately for you you don't know my real name, you don't know what is yet to come and besides i was tracking you two""  domanos was confused and uncomfortable, but tibos continued ""you two have revealed some very useful information to me, but now the only thing i need is your and your padawan's death"", tibos took his lightsaber from his robe and ignited the red double edged lightsaber which revealed tibos'  
pale downtrodden scarred face with the light coming from the sabre, then he turned him to domanos and said ""now give your little pathetic life to me"", domanos and profogo ignited their lightsabers as well  domanos quickly told to profo ""be careful son and remember what i told you, focus and trust in the force 

domanos made a force jump to the ceilling and pushed himself from the ceilling and attacked tibos with his blue lightsaber, the two were in a furious duel, while profogo was waiting to blend in the fight, but at the moment he was ready to jump in the duel, tibos stabbed domanos in his heart in the front of his son's eyes  profogo ran angrily towards tibos, ready to give him an uppercut but tibos force pushed profogo and his lightsaber out of the window  profogo knew he wouldn't stand a chance so he ran back to his father's ship and started the engines  meanwhile tibos walked slowly to the corpse of domanos and reached his hands out to the dead master and absorbed his life energy which gave his face color again, maked him younger and healed his scars  tibos didn't care about the young padawan anymore, he already get what he wanted, the energy of a jedi master and acces to the holocrons on coruscant  meanwhile profogo already departed with his father's ship away from kamino to his family home on dantooine, his father didn't followed the jedi code to protect him and make him a jedi knight  ""he sacrificed so many for me"" said profogo silently in his head, ""let's make it worth it"" he continued  meanwhile tibos departed his ship as well, ""time for the next step"" said he silently while setting the coordinates to naboo      ",darth jar jar  part i (fan fiction)

1970,starwars,"quick summary 

  legends    the clones are shady from the start  they know their true purpose and willingly execute order 66  the clones have unquestioning loyalty and murder their jedi generals in cold blood  the clones are completely aware of their actions  reference  501st journal

  canon    the clones are implanted w  inhibitor chips at the earliest stages of their development  when palpatine issues order 66, these chips activate and forces the clones to comply w  order 66  the inhibitor chips takes away the clones  agency and individuality 

  personal opinion    i prefer the retcon canon version as it's more logical  prior to tcw, the legends version made sense because the clones barely had any character development except for that they have ""unquestioning loyalty""  however, tcw has portrayed the clones as individuals who developed personalities, made decisions and defied orders they deemed wrong  the jedi and clones developed strong bonds as tcw progresses  i doubt palpatine would ve taken the risk to allow the clones to keep their agency ones order 66 is enacted  also, it s cruel how the inhibitor chips takes away the clones  agency and individuality 

regardless, i believe both versions of the arc is good w  respect to their respective universe and timelines ",order 66   do you prefer canon or legends?

1997,starwars,"like many i've eagerly awaited the kenobi series  obi wan is my all time favorite star wars character and i can't wait for ewan mcgregor to get another crack at him 

however, i never dreamed that a kenobi series might reunite obi wan and vader and upon the initial announcement of the ""rematch of the century"" my nerdy brain started puzzling as to how that would even work 

i've since come to believe that not only is there room for the rematch, but it's also a golden opportunity for star wars to shore up some movie canon lines, like the one in the title, with some context  

case in point, as it currently stands, vader's pronouncement that obi wan also believed there was still good in him doesn't quite jive with what we see in revenge of the sith  in that film, obi wan doesn't make much of an effort to save anakin  they start fighting each other almost as soon as vader stops choking padme  

obi wan makes it clear he doesn't want to kill anakin and even warns him before the final blow, but that's not the same as trying to return anakin to the light 

now comes the kenobi series and wouldn't it be a bit unexpected if obi wan, wracked with guilt and trying to complete his training with qui gon, sets out after vader in the hopes of redeeming him? only to have his good intentions dashed when vader tries with all his might and machinelike ferocity to destroy him, leading obi wan to conclude that anakin truly has been destroyed by darth vader 


i don't know, this is kind of rambly but i think there could be some exciting drama to be mined in  vader kenobi rematch beyond just the spectacle of a light saber fight ","""obi wan once thought as you do""  my hopes for the kenobi series "

i'm no professional tv critic but i don't see anything straight up bad about the acting in std  yes, tng and ds9 had better acting but i would say that's just an amazing job on the tng ds9 part, not a bad job on the std part  i'd say std is roughly on par with voyager enterprise (in terms of acting)  i'd even say things like modern marvel movies have a similar level of acting as std 

am i missing something? what's your opinion about std's acting? if you think it's bad, can you elaborate a little bit? is it all actors or just some of them? is something specifically bothering you about the acting or is it just an overall feeling?",what's suppossed to be so bad about the acting in std?

2002,startrek,"what if a group of planets got tired of starfleet letting horrible things happen in the name of the prime directive so they seceded from the federation and created their own utopia    with their own fleet of ships   that they built in secret for a decade   then when the federation won't stop horrible things from happening because of the prime directive they can swoop in and do something about it    because they aren't part of the federation    

they should have rules against getting involved in primitive civilizations   but those rules should be flexible and there should be exceptions   especially for preventing planetary disasters   they should also have rules against time travel   but they should be flexible too and time travel should be allowed especially to stop galaxy wide disasters   i wonder what the federation's response would be to something like this   

and what would they do if there was an even better utopia right next door   they would either have to change or watch as their member worlds left to join the new and better utopia   also i would hope the new utiopia would arm their ships much better and have much better planetary defenses   so that they are prepared for war   they don't want war and won't start a war but are more then prepared for it when it shows up on their doorstep   also it would be wise for their citizens to be armed and for their ships to have the latest defenses    that way they can oppose the government if it becomes corrupt and or a hostile invader   so let me know what you think in the comments ",what if a group of planets seceded from the federation and built their own utopia?

2004,startrek,"i've been bingeing star trek   tng, ds9 and now voyager   there are a few great episodes that have stood the test of time   but every season there seems to be at least one time travel episode and every other season an alternate reality episode   ds9 had that other dimension where major kira was bad and worf was bad but other characters were good   then they made a device that could transport to the other reality at will   they re visit this dimension 4 or 5 times in the series   did not like   the characters would have petty reasons for going to the other dimension 

on voyager, they end up being transported to earth in the 90s   then they have a mission to stop this catastrophe that will occur in the future and they are the only ones that can stop it   they are successful and then end up back in the delta quadrant   i mean        cmon!

also, ds9 had an episode where quark, rom and nog had a plasma leak and end up on earth in the 1950s   it seems that time travel can happen pretty easily and it's pretty easy to get back

the enterprise d was the federation flagship until its destruction, given picard's line about it prior to the battle with the klingons  i suppose we could assume the enterprise e was the flagship afterward, but i don't think we have any established dialogue to that effect   had the enterprise d not been destroyed, would it have remained the flagship until decommissioning or destruction, even if more advanced starships been commissioned?

2011,startrek,"it seems so weird to me  for example, the enterprise d is regularly considered ""the strongest ship of the federation"" (in ""the best of both worlds"", for example)  but a single romulan warbird, of which there appear to be many, can seemingly turn it into a smoking pile of debris without much effort  

from what i remember, it was the same in kirk's encounters with the klingons  i understand that the mission of the federation is peaceful in nature but these are known enemies  one would assume that a spaceship that is likely to act near (and sometimes in) the neutral zone should be equipped with the means to defend itself  

am i just being an idiot? i don't claim to have a broad understanding of star trek lore   i'm currently busy going through tng, i'm missing tos almost entirely and have yet to finish voyager   but it's a recurring theme that has bothered me ",why is the federation always outgunned?
2012,startrek,"there's a really fascinating split between the average critical reception of each series and movie compared with what the fandom generally believes to be the best  i'll admit to being surprised by quite a few of the scores from rotten tomatoes, which aggregates multiple reviews into a single average score 

ordering best to worst, according to an average of critical reviews, the franchise looks something like this 

  television  

1  tas  94 
2  ds9  90 
3  tng  89 
4  pic  87

right off the bat there's a massive difference between fan perception and general perception   star trek 09 is the best received star trek film, beating out first contact and wrath of khan 

i'm also quite surprised to see the animated series come out as the best reviewed show, while the lower decks appearing so low is equally surprising 

on the not so controversial list, i don't expect many people will be making passionate defences against the final frontier being the worst star trek film, however i'd argue enterprise deserves a slot closer to voyager's score ",looking at the franchise by critical reception throws up some interesting divergency with the fandom's general views

2019,startrek,"

with the jump into the far future in the 3rd season of disco, we have the chance to be reintroduced to old friends with new twists  the vulcans and romulans are now reunited  earth has become isolationist and even the federation itself is dramatically altered in size and  in character  

in this far future, we may wonder about the other races we knew so well  where are the klingons and cardassians? what will the borg look like in this future?

but we need not wonder about the ferengi  they will never be seen in this future  

how can i be sure of this?

it s because the ferengi have already been reintroduced   they are hiding in plain sight and are now called the orions  in this future, the orions have become all of the things that the ferengi were  or more accurately, they have become all of the things that the ferengi should have been before they were turned into a joke  

let s think back to the start of tng  the ferengi were supposed to be the main villains of tng  it was an interesting choice  in tos, the main villains were the klingons and the main philosophical debate was between cooperation (the federation) and conquest (the klingons)  this conflict mirrored the cold war reality at that time between the usa and russia  in tng the main philosophical debate was going to be cooperation (the federation) vs capitalism (the ferengi)  but sadly this was not the case  the ferengi bombed and the romulans took their place  

but now in disco, it seems like we have come back to the start of tng at least philosophically (cooperation vs capitalism)  the only difference is that the ferengi have been replaced by orions  

but have the ferengi really been replaced? perhaps the ferengi have just been reskinned?

let s look at the main villain of the 3rd season of disco, osyraa  she looks like an orion but she sure does act like a ferengi  

i wouldn t be surprised if she had a copy of the rules of acquisition in her back pocket  she certainly follows the rules of acquisition quite closely  

here are some examples of osyraa following the rules of acquisition  


  the riskier the road, the greater the profit   62nd rule  
she is a risk taker  osyraa takes big risks looking for big payoffs  stealing discovery and taking it to the federation was a big gamble  


 know your enemies    but do business with them always  177th rule  
she is a businessperson who makes deals to get what she wants  after she got discovery past the federation s shields, what did she do? attack like a klingon? no she tried to make a deal  how ferengi can you get!


 never ask when you can take   52nd rule  
of course, osyraa is not always so polite  when she has the upper hand she does as she pleases  


 there is no honor in poverty  106th rule  
 my ancestors knew that power is virtue, and there is no nobility in suffering    osyraa  nuff said  


 never allow family to stand in the way of opportunity  6th rule  
osyraa killed her nephew  as she said herself   you do what it takes to get what you need, or you don t     

 beware the man who doesn't take time for oo mox  223rd rule  ferengi believe that people should enjoy the sensual pleasures of life  osyraa is very sensual   look at the way she sat on the captains chair after she took discovery from tilly  she took time to enjoy her victory  

 learn the customer's weaknesses, so that you can better take advantage of him  87th rule  osyraa is very manipulative  she has her chief scientist, aurelio, thinking that she will save the universe as she saved him  

 hear all, trust nothing  190th rule  ferengi see nothing wrong with telling lies  lies are a natural part of communication among ferengi  trying to figure out what someone is lying about is part of the fun of social interaction as far as ferengi are concerned  thus when osyraa is talking about the lie detector holo, she says  where s the fun in that?   

every time i look at osyraa, i see a ferengi  

but wait!

you might say that she is a woman! ferengi women are not allowed to engage in business!

in this case we can assume that rom s reforms of ferengi society have taken hold and women are now equal to men in ferengi society ",there will never be ferengi in disco (spoilers!)
2020,startrek,"star trek has memorable characters with some degree of ""identity crises""   e g  spock, data, dax (especially ezri), odo, the doctor, seven, and even t'pol   and quite generally it is an important component in the character development but not the only interesting aspect of their personality  today i was thinking about how underutilized b'elanna was 

just for comparison, spock had his quarrels with mccoy, the friendship with kirk  data explored many aspects of ""humanity""  we could even compare b'elanna with ezri, the latter had just one season, but her development was decent  for six seasons b'elanna was the ""competent engineer  amp  tough half klingon""  that's it  eventually, the writers remembered ""ohh! we can explore her background!""   her mother was introduced in the 6th season (barge of the dead   very good episode) and her father in the 7th season (lineage)  her maquis background is just a footnote   my goodness, these episodes could have been fantastic

2021,startrek,"when i think about how star trek treats disability i think of geordi and his blindness  on first thought it seems handled very well  they managed to effectively remove his disablility and he can function as if he were not blind 

but the more i think about it, is this the right way to treat disability?

there are two ways to do it  modify the environment for the person or modify the person for the environment  what happened to geordie was the latter but what we seem to do in our society is the former  we try to make accomodations for people whereas they didn't even need to make changes to the environment to accomodate geordies disability 

when i think of another example of blindness   tukov in year of hell   this was done differently  tuvok had a tactile interface in order to use the console  this was an example of modifying the environment to accomodate an individual which i think is a better way of dealing with disability rather than just writing it out with a visor  so i end up thinking that they actually handled geordie's blindness poorly 

another example of disability is in ds9 melora, which i watched recently  it's about a person who is incredibly weak in normal gravity  their solution is a radical medical procedure and at no point was it considered to modify the environment to suit her disability  it was such an obvious solution to have her work in a low g environment but they made no accomodation for her disability 

this leaves me to conclude that star trek handles disability very poorly  what are your thoughts?",how do you think star trek handles disability?

2056,startrek,"i think there is plenty of criticism from trekkies trekkers regarding  discovery  and probably for good reason  but i think it is important not only to determine what is wrong, but suggest what would be a better alternative  (we should also note what they are currently doing right, but that isn't my topic here ) i'm just an old fashioned country trekker, not used to these fancy big city streaming programs, so i am aware i may just have unreasonable expectations in wanting this show to be like the other shows i know and love  i also think it's important to note the ""learning curve"" on most trek shows has tended to be about three seasons      remember the ferengi or doctor pulaski? or the kazon? i'm hoping that's the case here 

 amp  x200b 

here's what i want from discovery (that i'm obviously not getting now) 

1    i want a show that focuses on the      crew      of discovery, not on one individual character    if they are paying these actors to be on the bridge through three seasons, why do i know only half of their names?
2    i want a show that, at least occasionally, has individual episodes that have nothing to do with a wider universe, a huge story arc, or anything outside the episode    just a good self contained 3 act episode about a crazy planet they find or a mysterious ship adrift in space, etc  with the current formula, you can't have genius stories like ""the inner light "" i swear  breaking bad  ruined tv on this front  every show has to be written like a damn soap opera nowadays  and yes, get off my damn lawn, you kids 
3    i want a show that takes a breath every once in awhile    slow down the pace, dammit  show these people  living their lives   you know, like the poker games on the enterprise d, or the crew hanging out in ten forward  note that there doesn't always have to be a dramatic argument (whisper or loud) or physical fight going on, as is apparently mandatory on the uss discovery 
4    i want a show that, at least occasionally, has a clear message based on the actual plot of the episode(s)    sure, there are plenty of speeches but they rarely have anything to do with the episode and usually they're just talking about how great the federation is  that's not actually an ethical message, it's just politics and or propaganda 
5    similarly, i want a show that follows consistent ethical standards    discovery presents us with the most morally ambiguous trek series and depiction of starfleet (until they get to the future where the one and only admiral is super wise), but i don't know if this is actually a good thing  especially since it takes place in the prime universe where we have been conditioned to believe that starfleet and the federation are almost always attempting to do what is right  how do we go from discovery with its lying, scheming and machinations to the super enlightened uss enterprise only a few years later? if kirk, picard, sisko or janeway were captain, burnham would be in the brig and georgiou would have been tried for war crimes genocide whatever other heinous crimes she's clearly perpetrated 
6    i would like a show that will present an enlightened perspective on social issues, beyond simply having a diverse crew    this show has way too many characters thrown in simply to represent some demographic and they don't even have enough time to do the characters justice  i'm not gonna name names, but there are some characters on this show that barely have a name or are simply one dimensional but are clearly included so we can have ""one of them"" in the show  that's actually the opposite of progressive  it's called tokenism  there is a fine line here  if you have a complex character and you decide to cast a minority, that is progressive  if you hastily throw in a minority at the last minute so they can stand in the background, that is      sigh, an all too common practice in tv and movies  probably asking too much here 
7    i want a show that isn't afraid to tackle tough philosophical and or contemporary issues    you know, like star trek used to do? even if the message seems dated to us now, the episode ""let the be your last battlefield"" from tos was very relevant and made a powerful statement when it aired  likewise, ""the outcast"" from tng, though dated to our eyes, took an honest stab at dealing with many aspects of sexuality and gender politics  (it would be less dated if they hadn't toned it down from the original conception, and jonathan frakes was totally down with it too, according to interviews      but we're stuck with what they made  )
8    i want a show that stays in one ""universe"" for the most part    jumping timelines universes is the scifi screenwriting equivalent of ""and then he woke up "" just plain lazy  it can be interesting in small doses but not if you turn half the show into that  it give writers an easy way out if they get backed into a corner by a story 
9    i want      fun      episodes    anyone remember ""the trouble with tribbles?"" it may not be an absolute laugh riot but it's cute and makes you chuckle, which is really all that needs to happen  i couldn't imagine an episode like that taking place in the current discoveryverse 
10    i want a show that sets limits on itself    you know, like the fact that the ship can only go so fast, or transporters have a limited range, or people can't  just go anywhere instantly   when the enterprise d is being chased by a borg cube and they can't outrun it, that's genuinely frightening  discovery is at serious risk of giving itself the superman problem, wherein there are no real stakes because they have too many incredible powers

a medical noun

3 verbs

1 unfortunate verb (like fall)

a type of plural thing

an unfortunate place (like hole or hades)

a body part 

a regular noun

seven  each cube has specially designed plural things  if we install similar plural things throughout this vessel, then generate a sufficiently powerful field, we may be able to force voyager back into place 

chakotay  temporal sync with what?

seven  the vessel will return to the moment of the original unfortunate verb  since the verb will last for six or seven seconds, commander chakotay will have a short time in which he could try to counteract the warp core reaction 

chakotay  even if we could replicate these plural things, we'd have no way to get them through the unfortunate place 

janeway  body part 

chakotay  captain?

janeway  it runs through every section of the ship, almost like a body part  if we could inject the body part with your medical noun we could use them to transmit the plural things

2061,startrek,"i feel like if i keep digging, i will continue to find more   

",just a little something i noticed   
2062,startrek,"bear in mind that this is based on my subjective taste, and what i enjoy in a tv show  i totally get that my opinions are weird and not universal  i just want to try and explain why i am so frustrated with this particular aspect of discovery, among others  

i watch discovery every week  i enjoy it! the good parts keep me slogging through the bad parts, and there are way more good parts  (goddamn, did i love seeing human saru!) 

now, with that said    

things i hate about burnham as a character  

  her emotional reactions are tiring 
  her dialog is quite often badly written melodrama  
  she cries too much  
  the show focuses on her instead of more interesting characters  
  the other characters worship her for no good reason  
  she wins by being right when she didn't have enough data to know it  
  she seems to be specifically designed as the most extreme version of a mary sue it is possible to have  remember that episode of futurama with welshy, and the trekkie fanboy energy being who forced the tos crew to play out his bad fanfiction? 

now that you hate me, let me try to win you back  

things i love about burnham as a character 
  her relationship with book  i love it when those two are together, they have brilliant chemistry! especially when the cat is involved  all hail queen grudge! 
  when her and book were off the ship and having adventures together, i enjoyed the show so much more! i hoped like mad that the season would be half ""michael and book wander the galaxy saving endangered species"" and half ""the discovery crew get to shine without burnham getting in their damn way"" episodes 
  her getting high on drugs and ""infiltrating "" a market was fantastic 
  her and spock bounced off each other really well  i really got the brother sister vibe  
  she's great in action scenes! i love seeing her fight klingons, or indeed anyone  

see, all those points, and more, are how i know it's not sonequa martin green's fault at all  i am outraged at the writers showrunners for doing this to a perfectly good actor  it's like robert pattinson in twilight, or deniro in a sandler movie  

discovery is so frustrating! there's so many good people working on it, it has such great ideas, but too often executed so badly, with lazy writing and idiot plots  

anyway, hope that helped you understand why people go on and on about burnham, while still really loving this mycelial network, mirror universe, lgbt as fuck, diverse, forward thinking, defiantly itself, genuine star trek show   )

p  s  the characters i love unreservedly, some of who are part of why i keep watching, who i always want more of  saru, stamets, culver, adira, admiral vance, tilly (although making her first officer was dumb af), jett reno, lorca, pike, and emperor georgiou (although the crew should have kept hating her as hard as the ds9 crew hated dukat  another incomprehensible writing decision!)

the doctor writing his own story about hologram struggles is also a great plot idea, though wish he make an autobiography instead (would ve had the message that holograms can make their own decisions and be their own people, rather than creating a darker version of tuvix)  the episode definitely lacked focus somewhat and i wish it had focused on one or the other rather than combining both ","author, author should ve been two separate episodes"

she might be written poorly, that's the writers' fault, not the character's  the show does revolve around her  this is as much about burnham and her crew as tng was about picard and his gang

2076,startrek,,philippa georgiou was my favorite character  amp  now she s gone  
2077,startrek,"this was initially a comment in response to a thread that's since been locked  

in my humble opinion, i think that 13 episode seasons is partially what's killing discovery this season, and has held it back in the previous two  without the 10 15 bottle episodes we got with tng ds9 voy, we don't get to see the character growth we're being told is happening off screen  

if we had episodes driven by and focused on other characters, the focus on burnham as the central character wouldn't seem so stark and overbearing   it would be more like your sisko focussed episodes during the last couple of seasons of ds9  

also, it would let discovery breathe a bit  we're in the 32nd century, they have the spore drive, let's do some discovering!! revisit more old trek species  visit a planet still in the federation   we haven't seen any yet  interact with other starfleet ships and crews   i'm dying to see what the voyager j bridge is like, or who her captain is  show us how other crews react to a 900 year old museum ship appearing and expecting to join the fleet  explore the new technologies that are suddenly available to a crew 900 years out of place   give me some goddamn technobabble!! 

discovery likes to tell us what starfleet and the federation is all about, but the writers and producers of the show don't seem to realise that star trek isn't all about the plot arc, getting from a to b to c and wrapping things up with a tidy little bow  it's the human stories that go alongside it that shows us things like la forge and data's friendship, seven of nine becoming more human  in discovery it could easily show why the bridge crew got to like respect georgiou, or how the crew got to grips with their new normal in a much reduced federation 

there are so many stories crying out to be told in this new universe, but 13 episodes ain't enough

2085,startrek,"in this episode, heart of glory, the enterprise unwittingly rescues a couple klingon fugitives  even apart from the simple fact they're klingons, these guys are dangerous 

so when it's discovered that they are wanted by the klingons, picard sends a fucking security team to arrest them and take them to   the brig   security  why doesn't he use site to site transportation?? 

a fight doesn't break out yet, but when they're ready to transport the prisoners to the klingon battle cruiser, picard   again   sends a security team to escort them to the transporter room  not to mention they don't notice the two klingons openly assembling a disruptor in the cell    so ofc the klingons kill at least two starfleet officers 

i understand maybe in the interest of fairness that picard would want to alert the klingon fugitives to their situation  but you can do that   and   use site to site transport!

is this a plot hole? do they address this in the episode and i didn't hear it? did anyone else notice this? i couldn't find reference to this anywhere online 

  tl dr    in this episode, they forgo the use of site to site transport when moving klingon prisoners fugitives, opting for escort by human security team  this gets two officers killed  why don't they use the tech? why can't i find anything about this online?

2089,startrek,"i don't think it's wrong or illegitimate to dislike michael burnham  honestly i'm kind of ""meh"" on her myself  

but i think the hatred for her is a bit over the top 

you can't win if you're burnham  if the show portrays you as a capable hero who gets kicks ass and gets shit done, the fandom cries  ""she's a mary sue! she's too perfect! it's not star trek and it's lazy writing!"" if the show portrays you as being a good hearted but kinda screwed up person who grows and changes, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse, the fandom cries  ""she's not starfleet material! this isn't roddenberry's vision for humanity! it's not star trek and it's lazy writing!""

basically what i'm learning here is that that a huge chunk of the fandom has started from the premise that michael burnham doesn't belong on star trek and then proceeded to look for reasons why 

and if her mistakes and flaws and bad decisions  do  turn out to have consequences, they're never  enough   she needs to be punished  more,  for the heinous crime of being michael burnham 

like i said  i'm not the biggest burnham fan  she's   fine  like luke skywalker is fine, or harry potter is fine, or neo is fine  or james t  kirk is fine  a lot of protagonists for action adventure stories are often just solid viewpoint characters surrounded by a much more interesting supporting cast  personally i tend to  find the secondary characters more fun and compelling 

but that doesn't make me hate the protagonists for having the job of being protagonists 

again  if you don't like burnham, i can't tell you you're wrong for having that opinion (unless it's because of her race or gender, i guess  but other than that)  i just don't see why this much of the fandom's emotional energy needs to be expended on hating a character who, in a lot of episodes, is   just kind of  there  ",the extreme hatred for burnham is a little weird

2098,startrek,"i care about star trek  i've probably spent more time watching this franchise than any other  and up until a few weeks ago i was a staunch defender of discovery, despite its lack of continuity  like many series before it i thought it would figure things out and hit its stride somewhere around season 3  i was wrong 

past shows got better by eliminating their weaknesses and focusing on their strengths  unnecessary, or weak plots and characters are jettisoned, and better plots and characters are brought in  everything gets tweaked until they land on something that feels right  

we go from this    warehouse find  image (wordpress com) ( 

to this    star _trek _next _generation jpg (1920 1080) (cbsstatic com) ( 

and then they settle on it, and do deep dives into character development  entire episodes are dedicated to learning about various crew members, and how they are a special and integral part of the team  over time you find yourself caring about the entire crew and their relationships more  this is done organically through good writing  the way riker handles being abducted  the way picard handles living another life in the matter of a few minutes  how geordi handles being turned into an alien  how the rest of the crew handles those situations together 

    

when they settled on saru being captain of discovery i sighed in relief  i was getting tired of them flipping through captains  saru is my favorite character, too  that episode about his past, and his home planet was really enlightening and made me connect with him  i love stories about characters who grow and become bigger and stronger than they thought they could  

finally, i thought, the show can find an identity, anchored by a really great character 

but all through season 3 the plot kept getting forced toward michael in ways that make no sense  i'll just focus on one right now 

why is michael at the center of solving the burn? and why was her strategy for finding it not already explored before she arrived? the technique she used to pin point the source of the burn is probably the only option they had, yet she was the only one to think of it? 

for some perspective  as far back as 132 ad ancient china had developed a seismometer to pin point the location of earthquakes  

yet, this super advanced society, thousands of years more advanced, can't even  imagine  looking for discrepancies that might help it find a source of the burn       until michael burnham arrives? 

want to know why the show 24 fizzled out? it's because the writers couldn't continually write jack bauer into the center of everything going on in the united states without it becoming ridiculous  and that was a show unapologetically about  one man deliberately disregarding orders for the greater good   

with discovery, they're trying to make michael burnham the center of everything in the  universe   it was already ridiculous before the season began, but this year they've tossed any and all common sense out the window and doubled down on their choice to make the show all about her  

which would be fine if the writing could make that happen organically  which would be fine if she was a character worthy of that kind of gravitas  but it's not  and she's not  she's the weakest character on the show  but then we get that line about her being ""cut out for the captains chair "" saru, the most professional character with the most intriguing story    he's not? he's inevitably going to be forced out so that michael burnham, the least professional and least interesting character on the show can replace him? 

for the record  i don't hate burnham's character  i just hate that the show is centered around her and that the plot is written around that  it doesn't fit  it doesn't make sense  it's not interesting  it's not fun  it's not star trek ","lifelong star trek fan, with valid criticisms of discovery"

2107,startrek,"this way, should someone die during the mission their most recent pattern (captured at the time of departure) could be rematerialized along with the other crew members when they beam up, as if nothing happened, though the resurrected crew member would of course remember nothing of the mission, only up to the point when they were dematerialized   


yes, patterns degrade while in the pattern buffer  but how quickly? i could bring up the episode when scotty used a transporter for stasis purposes but that is held to have been a special circumstance, the other guy he tried to save didn't make it  this one time, his pattern remained stable for multiple decades  but because it was a fluke, we can't consider it representative   


there is however a ds9 episode wherein the crew of an exploding spacecraft are rescued via transporter at the last possible moment, but cannot be rematerialized right away  the entire station's memory is cleared so their patterns can be stored (nine people if i recall correctly)  their patterns remained in storage for   a few days? i think?   


this furnishes a more representative example because it wasn't a specially rigged setup by miracle worker scotty, but a quickly improvised solution using standard transporter tech available on the station  we have no reason to believe o'brien did anything special with the ds9 transporters in this situation which couldn't be replicated, unlike scotty's stasis feat    


that establishes that patterns can be kept in the buffer long enough for the typical away mission and then some without fatal degradation occurring  we know there exists sufficient memory onboard starships for as many patterns as they have transporter pads, as in order to transport that many people simultaneously, they need sufficient memory to keep that many patterns in the buffer during transport   


so, why isn't this standard practice? away missions are risky endeavors  should someone die during the mission, there's no good reason, even given in universe constraints on transporter technology, why their death should be permanent ",there is no in universe reason why transporters couldn't keep a backup of away team members in case of death 
2108,startrek,"the writers seem to have tried to make season 3 better but i feel it could improve on a certain things 

before an action scene is where character development seems to happen and is extremely predictable  the conversations always seem to be in the lines of "" i may or may not come back, so let's bond""  i'm pretty sure after going through what they did, they are pretty used to it  like the scene where they were trying to investigate the source of burn at the verubin nebula, it's almost like exploration and didn't need the excessively dramatic conversations before they ventured out  

from the recent episode, we discover osyraa speaks about the good side of her and it happens just one episode before the finale which isn't good  it's almost like they were still writing the character after the shooting began 

the story still moves through the eyes of burnham which makes it lack the flow this show badly needs  maybe half an episode dedicated to explaining the orion syndicate and how they came to what they are, talking about the scientist guy aurelio and his accomplishments would have made it much smoother and would have made this show even better ",dis s03 is better than the previous seasons but it lacks the flow

2111,startrek,"background  i only started discovery this year  lifelong trekkie, it s my go to show when stressed or anxious at night, etc  have gone to the convention here in vegas multiple times  love it all  i just resisted discovery because of the while all access thing and some of the spoilers i ve heard over the years didn t really interest me 

that said, here s my unoriginal take  michael burnham has turned in to a terrible main character and discovery is suffering as a result  mid season 3, it got so bad, i almost quit the show (still might)  am i alone in this thought?

season 1  klingons aside, i dug first season michael  i dig everything from lighting to the  twist , all that  i even pressed the  i believe  button on spock s secret sister storyline  in hindsight it wasn t necessary but it made for compelling episodes, so it works 

season 2  klingons corrected  complete tone shift  michael means more to spock, spock is insane but also saves time and space, show runners boot discovery to the future with an excellent tie in with a michael s mom and her upbringing    solid stuff  georgiou is loved but not exactly believable for me in most of the situations she s in   they finally started building the other characters a la every other trek show   i m excited for season 3! michael hangs with her mom, maybe?! we ll see!

season 3  the future!  fresh trek!  saru is a boss  he should have his own show  but     why is michael always breaking rules but allowed to continue serving starfleet in any commanding rank? her reckoning is to be  from xo but still finds herself at most of the important decision making meetings? why is every other line whispered? why does she come and go as she pleases and why is it always her to fix the issue? she is never wrong and when she is, somehow gets validated anyway  don t get me started on somehow whisper debating her way through several hundred years of romulan vulcan politics in an afternoon and somehow being the only person who thought about checking the black boxes (doesn t the chain have some pretty clever folk?)  don t get me started on plot device monk mom  the sisterhood of traveling candor felt that comfortable with such a new acolyte that they d send her own mother to be micheal s second? that whole episode wreaked of hamfisting a narrative just to keep michael as the plot engine 

season 3 seems to be star trek  micheal burnham  episode 3 is where i started to notice  season 1 and 2 were always michael focused bit their plots kinda dictated it  season 3 has a more  global  plot and for some reason the writers of discovery are doing everything they can to make michael an episode to episode lynchpin with far too much melodrama ",discovery  my michael burnham take  spoilers

2119,startrek,"one of kirk's top traits is skill as a military tactician, he quickly and clearly sees his enemies  weakness and how to exploit it   for example in the episode  the balance of terror  kirk quickly picks up that the romulan bird of prey decloaks before it fires because it has to   according to the romulan commander it was like kirk was a sorcerer who lived in his mind  

another great examples is  charlie x   in that episode kirk realizes the powerful charlie evans often makes people disappear when he s angry with them, however he also notices that charlie stops doing this when he takes over the ship   kirk concludes, correctly as it turns out, that charlie s power is limited in that if he activates all his ship s systems he may be able to overload him   kirk defeats charlie just in time for the thasians to pick him up  

even when he was over powered in the corbomite maneuver  he was able to outsmart his opponent by bluffing and does it again in his next encounter with the romulans    

kirk also shows of his skill taking the most sophisticated ais into killing themselves  and despite his intelligence, mr  spock often loses at chess to captain kirk     

however with trelane all his skills seem to mislead him   kirk notices that trelane likes the mirror and he concludes reasonably that the mirror is the source of his power   when he destroys it kirk thinks he has won but doesn't realize that he has miscalculated until he tires to turn his ship around and sees gothos facing him again     

as picard says in the next century "" it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose  that is not a weakness  that is life ""

it is worth noting that every time trelane meets kirk on even grounds kirk knocks him on his butt  however the boy god just falls back each time on his power   finally he grows board and corners kirk and the only thing that saves our dear captain is the arrival of trelane's parents

the episode live fast and prosper from voy also comes to mind      a group of con artists masquerade as janeway, chakotay and tuvok to abuse the reputation voyager and the federation has established in the region to scam desperate worlds of precious resources 

it feels like the emerald chain wants to use the federation as a layer of sheep's clothing to hide their wolf like reputation and behavior, use the name and reputation of the federation to get what they want from the rest of the galaxy with little no resistance because everyone helps the benevolent federation, but revert back to the cruel and barbaric methods of the chain down the road, with the benefit of saying ""but we are the federation, so our atrocities are actually morally and ethically justified since we establish what morals are in the galaxy""

maybe for season 4 they get a fancy new 31st century ship, the first new one with a dilithium based warp drive in a century, the uss  discovery  ncc 1031 b, with new uniforms and all?


from a production standpoint, it would also free up the discovery s corridors and sets to be transferred over to snw to be repainted and revamped to be the  enterprise  s corridors and sets, as well as freeing up the uniforms for use on snw guest cast, for when shooting starts early next near ",a thought as we head towards dsc s finale
2175,startrek,"i just finished ""there is a tide   "" and i found the entire sequence with vance osyraa fascinating  and i'm not at all convinced the admiral made the correct decision 

by the admiral's own admission the ceasefire is an amazing treaty (short of his one request, we'll get to that)  we know it ends slavery on countless worlds, and starts a 15 year plan to abandon 50 exploited pre warp civilizations (a plan likely covered in that treaty he read)  as osyraa rightly pointed out, anything faster would be chaos  you can't just create a power vacuum overnight like that 

we also learned that osyraa isn't the dictator of the emerald chain  she made reference to a parliament congress (can't remember the word she used) which actually passed laws and needed ""enough support"" to do so  suggesting a semi large and diverse legal body  yes osyraa has done horrible things, but she is not her government  (i would lake to take a moment now to point out the democracies of the world, mine included, which have spent the past few years enjoying a less then idyllic leaders  now tell me this makes the entire emerald chain, that just voted out slavery, evil )

the ""episode discussion"" thread is understandably spare right now at 12 30pm pst, but i am amazed at the number of ""well obviously osyraa was fooling the lye detector somehow"" comments  even without the above legal stuff, can we as a fandom really praise the ideals of the federation so highly yet not even entertain the idea that osyraa wants this to work? she may be machiavellian in her methods but she is still a leader  so i am going to accept the fact that the lie detector wasn't faulty and everything osyraa said was true  admiral vance believed it and he knows a lot more about the chain then we do 

so taking all that into account, i don't think insisting on persecuting osyraa at the cost of the entire treaty is the right decision  especcially not when made unilaterally by the admiral rather then the federation civilian government (which, may i remind you, is located in the same station as starfleet)  in fact i think osyraa may have even been persecuted anyways in time as the chain slowly liberalized 

the galaxy is incredibly destabilized at the moment  the federation has the dylithium supply and a spore drive, and dozens of planets and outposts with zero infrastructure  meanwhile the chain has is primarily a currier service with the scientific ability to turn that spore drive into a blueprint, but no dylithium  both sides have what the other needs  yes the chain has slavery and oppresses 50 primitive worlds  but it is one federation signature from ending slavery for thousands if not millions and freeing those worlds  that alone is a stabilizing force but the end of hostilities between the two major powers is even bigger  the distribution of dylithium and eventual spore drive technology is enough to get the galaxy back on track 

so admiral vance, if allowing one villan who is now extending the hand of peace to go free goes against federation principles widespread slavery, the oppression of 50 worlds, and an open state of conflict then i'm sorry  the neighboring nation has a bad egg  now tell me the klingons never did in tng  or the romulans during the dominion war  heck show me one decade, just one, where a high ranking starfleet officer didn't go against federation ideals 

at the very least, peace was worth a chance",was the right decision made in the latest episode?

2  voyager would get into fire fights in almost every episode but not have repaired the damage by the next episode   the ship would be falling apart like in year of hell   
3  the crew would have to become sociopaths to survive the delta quadrant   mutiny would become common   and it would be more like the terran empire where officers advance in rank by killing those who outrank them  
4  if janeway and chakotay were killed and tuvok had to take over as captain god help him   a lot of the crew doesn't like him and he would be fending off attempted mutinies on an almost daily basis   
5  janeway would execute more people   especially mutineers    janeway would reluctantly have to torture aliens in arilocks like archer did 
6  q would interact with the crew of voyager and realize they have become a group of barbarians   and put them on trial   
7  neelix would be thrown out the airlock because everyone hates his cooking 
8  janeway would have a total mental breakdown when she realizes what a hell hole the delta quadrant is   and that she should have gotten her crew home by any means necessary

and let's be honest, once discovery is done next week, there probably won't be any new trek on until late summer early fall at best  so perfect time for it!

2184,startrek,"just got the idea of quantum dream (detroit become human, beyond 2 souls) or someone like them making a star trek game that takes entirely on a star ship  maybe not one as large as the enterprise, but definitely a smaller ship with perhaps 75 crew members  

the world should be extremely detailed  think skyrim level of detail, but scaled down to a ship  every crew member should have his or her own quarters with his or her own background and personal decorations with a story in their quarters  

every crew member has their own schedule and jobs (like in oblivion but   better) 

every crew member should have their own side mission and you should be able to keep track of crew members like you could keep track of character schedules in zelda majora's mask 

everyone has interactions with everyone, and they especially have interations with you, like mass effect or tell tale games 

can be either 3rd person or 1st person, but im thinking first person would be better 

you play as first officer  you make sure everything on the ship is running accordingly  engineering, security, science, medical bay, etc all answer to you, but it's your job to make sure they have everything they need to function properly  this is the sim portion of the game 

how well everyone functions will dictate how well your battles go  you will have ship to ship battles, although political and diplomatic methods are preferred  imagine wanting to have a peaceful resolution with the klingons or romulans, and a peaceful resolution is possible  however, a choice you made earlier in the game makes it impossible, and as such, you get into a battle  if you have done your job properly and engineering security medical etc all function properly, you do well in the fight  if you sucked and as such your crew sucks, well, you take heavy damage  

and in fire emblem like fashion, characters actually die  so you may have spent 10 whole hours trying to romance ensign lira lwaxanton and boom, she was lost in a hull breach, her body lost to the vacuum of space 

you can have away missions, and they can be small load outs, like planet missions in mass effect 1 only    better 

you can choose your away mission crew  you think it's a good chance for ensign timmy pascal to earn his promotion  the mission is going well, and you can tell ensign pascal is trying his earnest not to let you down  you cant help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment for your crewman, youre definitely going to put in for his promotion 

then boom! he gets tasha yar'd bc you didnt choose your away team appropriately (like the suicide mission in mass effect 2) 

away mission combat would be ripped directly from xcom  
ship to ship battle would be essentially the game ""star trek bridge crew""

everything else would be tell tale mass effect quantum dream majora's mask fire emblem choice making 

and last but not least  holodeck  in addition to side missions specifically designed to be trippy (like most holodeck episodes), you can also just straight up use the holodeck to grind individual crew members for away missions (think mememtos from persona 5)",star trek game developed by quantum dream (dream game)

2190,startrek,when it was originally on i would watch episodes in the first season but i never really got into it that much i loved star trek deep space nine far more and i kinda just quit watching voyager at some point   but now with it on multiple streaming sites i started watching it more on netflix and later cbs all access i quite enjoy it now   i have found it to be pretty fun over all   at the time it was originally on i just kept comparing it to ds9 and tng and now i just can appreciate it as it's own thing more,i have come to enjoy star trek voyager more than i have in the past
2191,startrek,"the eugenics wars were a very big deal in the past history of trek's universe  one consequence was that humanity decided to embark upon a future that was anti transhumanist  humans would explore space for enlightenment, rather than becoming post humans  i almost suspect the federation itself would have some anti eugenics feature in its constitution 

that said, the rejection of genetic engineering and transhumanism was in a context in which eugenics was embraced broadly beforehand  hints from trek and my sense of roddenberry's attitudes makes me think that there was eugenics in trek 

that is, trek features ""liberal eugenics""  this is where all eugenics is done individually and not institutionally, and it is done in the context of a human relationship producing a child out of love 

you would have a fence of law built around eugenics, but within that fence technology would be applied to the absolute limit  

first of all ""picking the best fruit""   where a woman's eggs and a man's sperm are harvested and surveyed and the man and woman can choose which combination of their own genes is preferred 

second, mate selection based on genetic profiles 

third, epigenetic management (engineering everything except for the genes) 

fourth, things like best practices for nutrition and child development to unlock the full potential of a person's genetic baseline 

when people date, they'd check genetic profiles as casually as people today talk about whether they want to raise kids in the city or the country  a person who loves music might want to find a gifted musician to have kids with 

but this is all liberalized, so nothing is force, there are no rules to it and you can do ultimately what you want  however, there is effectively a eugenic program in the society 

my evidence for this   and it's more of a roddenberry conceit   is that season 1 episode with the child who has calculus homework 

clearly roddenberry is implying a few things by this  educational methods will be ""that good"" in the future, half of why mankind is more mature  maybe starfleet are the best of the best, so smart even their kids are natural geniuses 

however, i think   given roddenberry's very casual and open attitudes about sexual liberalization and how we should shed certain inhibitions and the idea of techno progressivism   that roddenberry is implying that people themselves are smarter and better in the future  that this isn't transhumanist (which they back then called ""eugenics""), but rather natural  which is implicitly eugenecist 

anyway, i like to sometimes think about the elements of the future in trek that we take for granted (like no money) and how it might work a lot differently than we think  after all, if we knew how it worked, we'd do it already  the whole point is they've figured some things out that we haven't  that's why it's the future 

even so, the question of liberal eugenics is interested  once cultural stigmas wane, there's no reason not to do it  on the other hand, eugenics is a concession that some ""kinds"" of children are more valuable than other ""kinds""  that will play in poorly to social divisions and structural inequities 

we aren't mature enough yet to engage in eugenics with a liberal spirit, we'll use it to embed our imperfections  in this sense, eugenics is paradoxical  it's the quest for a more perfect version of our imperfect selves ",eugenics wars   i think there are still eugenics in the future

2217,startrek,"  

now, one of the things that annoy most fans of a franchise as long running as the trekverse is the continuity errors  

and the change in tone of each show   in this same reddit, and almost every place where fans congregate, you can find declarations that ds9 voy dis ent whatever  just isn t real trek   me, for instance, loved ds9 for its plot and writing, but don t want to imagine federation s dark sides  (said dark sides shot upto eleven during picard, so much that i quit watching that one ) 

one possible explanation   parallel universes 

we saw in parallels that thousands of universes, with much the same individuals, exist at the same time, with their own differences based on individual choices  each show and each movie series  is from a different parallel universe   each universe has had a kirk picard janeway and their teams, but each universe also has subtle differences, different choices   the tos universe is not the same as tng one, the ds9 universe is not the same as the voy one, the movies are not set in the same universe as the shows, and so on 

so in one universe federation remained the knight in shining armor, in another it took a level in jerkass, in one universe data lived long enough to be an admiral, in another he died in nemesis, in one universe picard was disillusioned and broken, in another he is still with the more or less idealist federation, and so on 

that, at least, is my headcanon  (mostly fueled by a need to undo the depression from  watching the kelvinverse films and picard back to back   okay, it happened, but it didn t happen to the spock and picard i fell in love with! sigh  i am taking this a bit too seriously )","parallel universes   or, how to explain continuity errors"

2238,startrek,"  

try and follow me on this  the concept of the multiverse is based on the idea that for every choice there is a reality that stems from that choice  actions and consequences  other names and or depictions of this concept include alternate timelines, dimensions, realities, etc  much like with the plot of  steins gate  anime which is based on the  world line theory  

now, the federation universe is fundamentally different than the mirror universe because essentially the entire universe is different  almost polar opposites  following the worldline theory each universe belongs to a separate  attractor fields  because event took place that was so significant that it changed the entire reality of that universe to diverge from the federation universe  in the mirror universe  terrans  are violent conquerors whom have spread throughout the alpha quadrant enslaving, destroying and generally conquering every world they came across  the federation universe works much the same way but only in a peaceful manner where humans venture out in an exploration manner with friendly intent and curiosity which ultimately gives birth to the federation of planets   

our only point of reference here where the universes go separate paths is during first contact  however, in the scene where zefram cochrane is to meet the vulcans as you see in star trek enterprise it is almost as if they had been expecting aliens to visit them  almost as if they knew aliens were out there  zefram cochrane believed that the vulcans were would be invaders, so he killed them and raided their ship  why would he think that especially when they were showing peaceful intent? 

enter nog  in ds9 the episode  little green men  nog, quark, and rom end up crashing on earth in the far past  it was like the 50 s 60 s era  i suppose the fault wouldn t solely land on nog since his uncle quark was posing attempting to sell future technology to the americans with a threat to sell to their competitors instead which lead to suspicion of their circumstances  ultimately it was nog whom laid the final brick in that when he attempted to bluff by telling them they were an advanced scout for an invasion fleet  humans, specifically americans were very suspicious people at the time due to the russian threat so to plant the seed of doubt in their minds about friendly alien life could have lasted throughout the ages until first contact  

considering all that i have said  the theory stands that nog is the cause and thus creator of the mirror universe   because he created a reality changing event that shaped the future so dramatically that it split the universe into 2 separate universes  one where humans were friendly and curious about the galaxy, and one where humans were xenophobic and mistrustful of all alien life resulting in their conquering nature ",mirror universe theory

2246,startrek,"in star trek, there are many races, if the borg designation system is anything to go by, then there 10,000 ish different species out there, but i know there are some trek fans out there whom could append certain personality traits and quirks to certain races, and i thought it would be interesting to se what race s people append to my own personality, so, i'll list the trait quirk of me and maybe a short summary of it, and see what races people append to my personality 

here goes, i'll start with the good traits quirks 


honesty  i truly believe thatone should always be honest, no matter the consequenses 

logical  i will openly admit that i am definately a man of logic 

reasonable  i can get hot headed from time to time, but i'm not one for doing domething unreasonable 

proud  this i can see as both a good thing and a bad thing, but in a good way, i feel a sense of pride more often then not after acomplishing something that i believe to be significant 

humble  i hate toting myself off like the best thing since sliced cheese, if anything i think people overestimate my abilities 

loyal  i never turn my back on a friend or family member unless they have done something i cannot forgive them for 

understanding  i am nothing if not willing to pay attention and understand others problems 

kind  i do think my kindness might lead to my death eventually, but i can't help it, nothing feels better than showing someone a little kindness 

caring  this trait reinforces alot of my particular gripes about society and the state our world is in 

tolerant  it is very hard to get me all rilled up, simple as that 

univerality keeping things the same  i do love to keep things to just one thing, i despise competition like it's the bubonic plague 

adaptability  to some degree i am adaptable, but in others, i am not 

lack of individuality drone everyone the same  while i do agree that if everyone was the same the world would be very boring, but i would rather live in a boring, peaceful world than a diverse, chaotic one 

anti capitalist pro communist  i despise capitalism and the people who accept it, and i fully support communism(and no russia was never true communism, i suggest you read the communist manifesto by carl marxx before you go giving communism any flac)

honourable  i am a man with much, much honour 

go getter  when something needs doing that i know needs doing, i will go do it 

anti warring  i truly believe that wars are wasteful, illogical, unreasonable and unwanted 

misanthropic  because of the fact that society refuses to change for the better(aka go back to how society was in the 80's and 90's), my hatred of society is quite immense 

philantropic  i believe that the world can change for the better, and it falls onto those with large sums of money to make that change happen, sadly 

wise  i have those moments where someone asks me for some life advice and i lay on some words of wisdom 

nostalgic  i love the past, i hate the present, i am hopeful for the future 

reliable  i can always be counted on to get something done that needs to be done 



now the bad traits quirks

arrogant  i wouldnt say i'm fully arrogant, but there are things i will flat refuse to accept for one reason or another 

pride  i admit, at times pride does blind me, but without pride, i could never survive 

anger  i'm not quick to anger, nor easy to anger, but when i do get angry i become very vocal, fortunately i am not owtwardly aggressive 

regretful remorsefull  i hate my past and would desperatly love to change it 

jealous  mostly when it comes to women, if i see a beautiful woman attached to another man and not me, i do die inside 

vengeful  only towards one guy from my past, but if you push me that far over the edge and yeah, i become quite vengeful 

lazy  oh yeah, guilty as charged 

paranoid  i'm always looking over my shoulder, afraid of getting stabbed in the back for no reason 

emotional  emotions are illogical, unreasonable and as human history has shown, it too unpredictable, emotions should always be suppressed, although sadly for me my attempts to supress my emotions backfire very miserably, anger being the one that is the worst, having supressed my anger for nearly 26 years(i was 27 at time of writing), and now bottling up my anger only causes it to burst out worse, for an example, if say someone is trying to antagonise me on purpose and were pushing me till i snapped, my first instict would be to beat the ever beloved shit out of them till they were on the ground unconsious, but instead i try to bottle up that anger knowing that letting it out won't do any good, and instead i beat the shit out them untill they died, so yeah anger is one emotion i have sadly learned that bottling up will only lead to something worse, humans make very illogical decisions all based on their emotions, not by logic 



in my own assesment i would say i show more vulcan traits, then klingon, then borg, but maybe that's my self assesment ",what race s do my traits and particular quirks represent?
2247,startrek,,if lolcats wrote star trek
2248,startrek,"so my theory is that the ancient hebitian people on cardassia prime were actually lost bajoran colonists 

we know that bajoran civilization began to flourish  more than five hundred thousand years ago , which is 100 times longer than human civilisation has been around, this implies that while the ancient bajorans were renowned for their accomplishments in science, mathematics, philosophy, and the arts, as a species they developed very slowly compared to other species as they had only just achieved warp the year the cardassian invasion started (presumably a contributing factor, with the cardassians potentially being afraid they would lose influence to the bajorans) 

this means that it s possible that the bajorans could have been stuck with sunlight technology for hundreds of not thousands of years with the solar sails being a later generation of this, presumably the bajorans had thousands of years of space exploration if humans have been exploring space of sorts for 500 years 

the hebitians, the first civilisation on cardassia only emerged about 10,000 years before 2376, hundreds of thousands of years after the bajoran civilisation had emerged, so my theory is that about 10,000 prior to ds9, the bajorans experimented with sunlight generational ships attempting to settle people in nearby worlds, the first attempt at these ships was thought lost when they stumbled upon tachyon eddies, which accelerated their lightships beyond the speed of light and enabled them to reach the neighbouring cardassian system  crash landing in the desert world they established a new civilisation, the hebitian civilisation and somehow, perhaps through genetic engineering, they became cold blooded  reptilians  perfectly adapted to live in a hot desert environment 

there is actually some evidence that could support this, first is the fact that bajorans and cardassians are the only two species in the entire franchise that we know can reproduce naturally without any medical intervention, binary cloning or genetic tampering at all, which is shown or implied to be needed for every other hybrid species (this lead to a theory that the two species are somehow the same which forms the basic premise of this theory), it s never explicitly stated so it might not be, but it is very likely the bajoran cardassian hybrids are fertile  this fits the common definition of being the same species which implies that even after the alterations that lead to the cardassians different appearance and adaptations, the robust genetics remains the same 

the ancient humanoids are not an explanation for the ability for the two species to naturally reproduce, as i previously stated other specieslile humans and vulcans are shown to require a lot of medical intervention to combine the dna and even then it s quite rare, the species only have a common ancestor in a single cells amoeba, that s like expecting a human and a banana to naturally reproduce 

there is also the fact that the hebitians were described as being an agrarian society as well as farmers, scientists and artists, exactly like the bajorans were before the occupation 

at one point the hebitians feel and the militaristic cardassian civilisation replaced it, yet genetically they were still the same species, the cardassians grew a deep hatred for the hebitians and tried to eradicate all traces of their culture from cardassia prime, perhaps this lead to an unconscious cultural bias against the bajorans or perhaps the cardassians had discovered the hebitians were actually bajorans and destroyed all traces of them to cover it up as it would have negated the belief they were the  superior species  

there are a few holes in this theory, being that if bajorans were capable of building and launching ships 10,000 years ago, how exactly the bajorans came to look like cardassians and the exact reason for destroying any traces of the hebitians, but if we fill in the blanks, the theory would actually make a lot of sense  i have tried to give some examples to fill in the blanks such as the potential genetic engineering to tailor the colonists to a desert environment 

ignoring the ancient humanoids seeding life on planets throughout the galaxy (not relevant to the theory), what are the chances that two intelligent humanoid species would evolve in neighbouring star systems, develop similar cultures and be magically genetically similar enough to be able to produce fertile offspring naturally?",hebitians are bajorans

2284,startrek,"thoughts on star trek discovery 

star trek discovery isn t bad because of the casting or diversity, it s bad because of the writing and character decisions  all this  forced diversity  is just  diversity  but with an extra word added  it s all about the writing imo  they could cast an old black guy and write him so bad and people would dislike it  writing is important in a show as big as star trek  sexuality and diversity has always been in the franchise as a whole, you cannot discredit a show for wanting to do it more  

the effort of writing is where the struggle for the characters come in, your interest in their struggles because that s what makes a person  human , audiences respond to fear and levels of self doubt and the character development allows all that to flourish when characters grow, if a character (or characters) are already strong then what s the point there is absolutely no way of riding around the development because they end up as a blank slate (aka batwoman, example  kate kane literally showed up to gotham with no combat experience and demanded her suit regardless of the fact she never had any fighting or combat experience just like bruce wayne did, bruce always trained yet she didn t and she s hardly comparable in size)

next is the approach to handling diversity is important, you don t wanna hammer every alphabet in there or race otherwise fans will notice and start to realise it only exists to preach to the audience, there are reasons batwoman did so horribly no one not even the  sjws  wanted it but it s quite strange they were all for it until the show began, the ratings dropped and they will continue to so unless they scrap their writers room and get someone who can handle better writing and a less self indulgent show runner ",star trek discovery is ehhh   
2285,startrek,"so, i'm amongst the many people whose eyes rolled  hard  at the seeming revelation in last week's episode that a child's tantrum caused the burn and, ultimately, the deconstruction of the entire galaxy  i remain hopeful that this is a misdirect, and somehow there'll be a more satisfying explanation, but i thought it might be fun to spitball some ideas to see what creative minds we have in the sub, and to see if we could come up with a more satisfying solution than we've seen so far 

i'll start off with a possibility that i've put together  i'm taking it from the beginning of the last episode, and keeping everything pretty much the same up until that point  personally, i'd have been disappointed if it did end up being a q or something like that because, again, it would feel to me that discovery is just leaning on nostalgia and not standing on its own two feet 

so, the way i would have played out events is as follows  discovery follows the distress signal to the same location, the nebula, and they still find the dilithium nursery planet inside  we know from previous episodes that there were experiments going on to tackle the growing scarcity of dilithium, and we find out that the site where the burn began was due to another experiment   someone (maybe even the kelpien scientist) had developed a spore drive 

unfortunately, they ran into similar problems that discovery and her sister ship did early on   they didn't have a navigator  when they activated, they were pulled into the dilithium nursery, and this triggered a cataclysmic reaction that travelled back along the mycelial network, rendering most other dilithium inert, since it's connected to everything in the galaxy  at this point, you could have stamets explain that, when he's been navigating the network, he always felt a pull towards certain places, and hadn't considered that they might be places containing massive amounts of dilithium before 

now, you could still have osyraa taking over the ship with this plot, but she doesn't know that stamets is the navigator, and so you have the struggle of trying to convince her not to do a jump outright trying to stop her so that you have the tension going forward  

this gets resolved through various stuff (haven't figured this bit out), and eventually all is resolved  stamets mentioned that it's not just those coordinates he's felt drawn to within the network, and therefore it's realised that he's able to seek out these dilithium nurseries, thereby resolving the shortage and helping to start bring the federation back together again (instead of burnham saving the day for a change!)

2286,startrek,"i was thinking conceptually about what a bridge duty science officer aboard an exploration cruiser like the enterprise d might look like and how they would function   spock's role aboard the tos enterprise wasn't directly revisited and data more less was ops science officer, whereas ds9 had dax and voyager had samantha wildman      


i think the bridge science officer would be a stand out among other science personnel aboard the ship and have leadership skills in addition to a well rounded science background with their own specialty   

various science department heads that work in the labs aboard the enterprise would report daily to the bridge science officer (similar to how chief o'brien did his daily maintenance with staff aboard ds9) about findings they want to submit to starfleet   ship board resource requests   upcoming studies they would like to conduct with their staff   different science disciplines would be represented aboard ship including astrophysics, stellar cartography, geology, biology, ect  and the heads of those departments along with their staff would aspire to become a ship's bridge officer in their own career ",science officer  tng

2312,startrek,"(i tried asking this before, but i think my comparison to a non star trek work distracted people from the actual request ) 

i've seen every star trek film and every episode of every star trek series     except  lower decks , which i started this afternoon! i've watched some of the trek series all the way through multiple times 

a common thing about the trek films  amp  series is that they all are told from the perspective of starfleet personnel   star trek  picard  toys a little with being non starfleet     but, of course, the title character is about as starfleet as you can get 

however, i have grown a bit tired of the starfleet perspective, so i'm looking for content in the trek universe that's different  

since i've already seen  all  the films  amp  tv series, can you recommend  other  star trek works (i e , books, comics, games, really good fan fiction or fan series) with the following characteristics  

  set in the trek universe
   not  episodes seasons installments of any of the existing canon star trek series or films (since i've already seen them all)
  most importantly, tells stories from the perspective of  non starfleet  characters

i'm hoping to find stories in the trek universe that represent something other than the mission and perspective of starfleet and it's personnel  i want to experience the perspective of the other inhabitants of the trek universe    the ones who don't live in a federation ship base academy  bonus points for content about the dark underbelly of the trek universe

2313,startrek,"i recently finished watching enterprise   and i really, really enjoyed it  much better show than anyone gives it credit for  obviously i was not a fan of the ending for all the reasons i think anyone could imagine  

but that made me start thinking about how other trek series have ended  did a rewatch of the voyager finale last night   i think i ve seen it 4 or 5 times now   and it s the first time i ve ever wondered  was this a good finale for this show?  i have no problem about them finally getting back to the alpha quadrant but i kept thinking 

 does this ending work for this show? 

i think my big issue is admiral janeway explicitly calling her past self out for destroying the caretaker s array  i m sure every fan has their own feelings on it, i know i do, but i certainly believe that janeway s actions for the rest of the series strengthen the point she was trying to make by rejecting the array  that the values of starfleet are important and worth struggling for  

and then you ve got admiral janeway sayings  no, i don t really think they are  not how me and my crew struggled   the finale deals with this quickly by having captain janeway pushback and deus ex borging the admiral out of of the story    but i ve still got wonder 

what do folks think?",how do people feel about voyager s ending?
2314,startrek,"first a quick disclaimer i like discovery generally and i am not trying to bash it but i found this odd   in the original ""mirror mirror"" the mirror universe was presented as a type of funhouse mirror image of the prime universe   despite the clear differences between the two universes  an evil terran empire as opposed to a peaceful federation, the term mirror made sense for everyone was still the same   captain kirk was the captain of the enterprise in both universes   spock was still the first officer, scotty the chief engineer for both as well   uhura, sulu, chekov almost everyone down the line was still doing the same thing their counterparts were in prime universe   dr  mccoy managed to spill acid in the same place in both realties     

on discovery however it is different    philippa georgiou is the captain of the shenzhou  her fate is she is killed and eaten by klingons   in the mirror  philippa georgiou is emperor of the terran empire, has conquered the klingons, and eats kelpiens 

michael burnham was at the start of the series first officer of the shenzhou before her fall   in the mirror was the shenzhou's captain and heiress apparent to the empire 

sylvia tilly at the start of the series was a starfleet cadet while her mirror counterpart was the captain of the discovery

2315,startrek,"spoilers for discovery season 3x11 below  

first, i know i won't be covering any new ground, so i apologize   but i've become frustrated with a thing i love, star trek, and think venting might make me feel better  

second, i am 40 years old and have been a star trek fan all my life  i remember being teased for it in elementary school, hiding it in high school (and beyond), going to conventions in the 90s, and starting for hours at mr  scott's guide to the enterprise and the enterpise d technical manual   i have watched all of it, and mostly love all of it   (my opinions on the kelvin universe are a separate rambling post) 

my rant   i have enjoyed discovery for most of its run so far  i have the same criticisms i think most of us have and clearly see the show's flaws  the frantic pace of the first two seasons, the awkward storytelling, making michael the center of the universe, etc , but the most recent episode is the first time i've felt close to giving up (i obviously won't, but i hate feeling like this)  

 i hate ensign tilly being number one (as much as i hate pine's kirk being ""acting captain""), but i understand the showrunners like the actor and character, so i've tried to go with it   she did a good job in the role, but she was a cadet one season ago, and there are more experienced officers available   it's beyond absurd watching it in action     

 stamets trying to prevent hugh from going on the mission was strange, awkward to watch, and makes no sense   they're both professional star fleet officers!  it's what they signed up for   plus, it's far from the most dangerous mission we've seen a character go on   i didn't understand it   we already know they love each other   

 the adira and gray subplot is pointless   him going away maybe helped develop adira's character somewhat, but we find out he went away for   reasons, and now he's back for   other reasons?  his return was out of place in this episode and felt forced   i like the character adira, but could have passed on gray coming back   

 also, have we established that people can just beam through shields?  what was the point of upgrading discovery with 31st century tech?  

 finally, and maybe most importantly, making the burn be an emotional alien we've never heard of feels like a slap in the face   i know we've seen gary mitchell and other hyper powerful beings in star trek before, but this is a season long arc   maybe it'll be better in the final two episodes, but this is rough   why do writers of things we love feel the need to ""subvert expectations"" so much?  got and star wars sequels anybody??  this could have been the omega particle   and somehow fixed by discovery's spore drive   keep the rest of the season arcs and get rid of the exploding dilithium planet, and come up with some way discovery has to risk itself to save the future of the federation   i don't know   i'm not a paid writer

(initially i was excited that  star trek  picard  seemed to be going a different way in the first few episodes, but it swung back to typical star trek morality play style by the end of season 1 ) the  gt !terran empire and section 31! lt  injected a little welcome intrigue and moral ambiguity into season 2 of  discovery , but not as much as i would have liked

while i did miss the episodic, exploration focused style of tng, i think ds9 more than made up for it with how well it handled its characters and story  this was easily my favorite cast of characters in star trek, and i don't see them being topped  each one of them were so interesting and layered, and had excellent development throughout (shout out to kira for being my favorite character, and my second favorite star trek character period)  even the minor characters were amazing, to the point where i'd say i like damar, nog, weyoun, rom, and martok just as much, and in some cases more than, some main cast members in previous star trek's  and theit relationships were so great, it even gave the best bromance ever! this is seriously one of the greatest casts i've ever had the joy of experiencing in media 

and the stories were excellent  many of the episodic adventures were amazing, easily just as good, if not better than the best of tng, and when the sequential episodes were fantastic, and really showed that star trek could work in different formats than just the typical episodic structure  

i also have to applaud it for being the most consistent show  tos has it's very underwhelming third season, tng has a rocky start, and while the last two seasons are great, i felt as though the consistency was starting to dip a bit  ds9, however was great from beginning to end, if anything, it only gets bettter  i think i've heard that people aren't too fond of the first season, and while i agree that it was the weakest one and you could tell that they were finding their footing, i honestly thought it was pretty good, probably around the same level of quality as tng s6 and 7, maybe a bit lower  

i also want to tackle some more spoiler heavy topics, mainly concerning stuff that i either have issues with or am just a bit mixed on, so i'll go into those now 

 gt !might as well start with dukat  what an amazing villain! at first, i didn't understand why people loved him, and then i watched neccessary evil, and it all became clear  however, i know some people do not like the direction his character went after sacrifice of angels  personally, i like it, but i do admit that i liked pre breakdown dukat a good bit more than post breakdown dukat  like, i think it makes sense story and character wise, especially when the pah wraiths really come into the mix, and i do think that they needed to either get rid of dukat or do something new with him after soa, and he's still an enjoyable character and villain, but i do enjoy him when he's more of a complex character, rather than a raving mad man out for revenge  he's still a good character, just different and simpler ! lt 

 gt !speaking of the pah wraiths, i'm not really sure what to make of them  they work as a way to create conflict in order to give the whole prophets plotline an ending, but they just sort of felt   i guess segmented from everything else, especially near the end  that last showdown with sisko and dukat wasn't bad, but rather than an plotline that felt as if it were as equal to the dominion war in terms of importance, it felt more like the story went ""oh wait, one more thing!"" and quickly took care of it  i guess i can sum my thoughts up as i think it was a good idea that could have been integrated better  oh yeah, and kai win, almost forgot about her  again, i think her character arc in s7 made sense, but it was over a bit too quick for me and was too isolated from everything else! lt 

 gt !i am definitely not a fan of the odo and kira romance, never got why they kept pushing it in that direction  okay, i kinda get it for odo, but not kira, especially after how he acted when the dominion took over ds9  i loved their friendship, i think they worked great as friends, but as lovers? i'm sorry, i don't buy kira having romantic feelings for a guy who has done, and believes in, some very sketchy things that go against her beliefs and values ! lt 

 gt !jadzia is the character who grew on me the most, going from a character that i didn't have any strong feelings towards at all, to one i really liked  i knew her death was coming (i don't remember how i got spoiled, i think i looked up the cast or something and got spoiled that way), but it still got to me  not the biggest fan of how it was handled, and from what i've heard from the bts stuff, i'm disappointed in why it happened, but i think killing off a main character worked for ds9, and it being the one who could technically come back made for some interesting stories  i like ezri, and i think they did a good job at integrating her with only one season left, but i admit, throughout s7 i kept thinking ""i miss jadzia"" and ""i wonder what this scene would be like if it where jadzia instead""  again, i like them both though ! lt 

 gt !to end the spoiler section on a positive note, i really have to give credit to how the handled damar, because wow, i am honestly surprised with how well the handled him, and how much i like him as a character  i honestly thought he would just be some minor grunt who i would like, but not think much of, but his development from a grunt, to a miserable, drunk who reluctantly serves the dominion, to a revolutionary who leads his people to freedom was just perfect  and to have him come to some level of understanding when it comes to how horriblethe bajoran occupation was through the dominion occupation of cardassia was fantastic, and again demonstrates how nuanced star trek, and ds9 especially can be when it comes to writing  it doesn't absolve him of all the horrible things he had done, but it does show that even someone like damar has the capacity to grow, and i truly think that if he had lived, that he would have tried to repent for the bajoran occupation in someway  again, doesn't absolve him, but at least it shows that he had the capacity to be a better man  i seriously just love damar as a character, he's one of my top favorite star trek characters ! lt 

i feel like i said everything i needed to, and i expect that i haven't said anything that hasn't already been discussed many times, but i hope you've enjoyed my excited rambling  deep space nine was truly something special, and it has become something that i will hold with me forever  now to watch what we left behind, and then onto voyager! i know that from here on out, things get more contentious, but i'm going to go into voyager with an open mind and a positive attitude, and hopefully come out the other end satisfied  

and as one last note to end on, i thought i'd give my (tenative) top 10 episodes, in no specific order  neccessary evil, the visitor, far beyond the stars, in the pale moonlight, tacking into the wind, rocks and shoals, the die is cast, civil defense, it's only a paper moon, and what you leave behind ","i just finished watching deep space nine for the first time, and i have to gush!"
2348,startrek,"federation starships have awful security   here are a few ideas for how to have better security and how to repel boarding parties   

1  put a self destruct button on the captain's chair   that can only be activated by the captain   the computer can confirm it's the captain by dna scan   also label it something different so it's not obvious it's a self destruct button   have the self destruct button also lockout the computer and command functions   the boarders can either leave or be vaporized 
2  have the computer track crew members so it can identify non crew members   and increase gravity by five or ten times to pin them to the floor   and or beam them into the brig or the shuttlebay   
3  use transporter scrambers to prevent boarding actions in the first place   no one is going to want to beam aboard your ship if they think they are going to end in trillions of pieces 
4  holographic soldiers   use holographic soldiers to repel boarding parties   you could make an army of holograms that activate if the ship is boarded 
5  interior defenses   set up turrets and maybe smoke grenades throughout the ship   if anyone beams onbard without permission the turrets stun them while the smoke grenades create a distraction   
6  for the 32nd century you could program the programmable matter consoles to strangle anyone who isn't a member of the crew   or have them turn into phasers and stun non crew members 
7  make it so that the self destruct button also activates all of the ships defenses and does all of the above   you could arm the self destruct and beam the boarding parties into the brig   and activate holographic soldiers   and interior defenses   and have the programmable matter deal with the boarding parties, etc   basically activating all of the ships security systems with one button   

so the federation really needs to have plans to repel boarding parties   and have better security on their ships   these are just a few ways they can do that ",how to repel boarding parties
2349,startrek,"i'm obviously talking about owo, detmar, bryce and that other dude who's always on the bridge whose name i don't even know  they have been there since like the first episode (i think, been years since i watched season 1) and they don't really have character and rarely any storylines  also they are on the bridge in literally every scene that takes place there, like don't they ever get a break? discovery isn't any good at writing storylines for characters other than the main ones ",side characters in discovery that should have bigger roles
2350,startrek,"people seem to board ships and just do whatever they want with little resistance, that drives me nuts lol  imagine a starfleet ship that could deploy holographic security anywhere on board with the safety off, with any type of weapon(even hand to hand melee weaps)  they could easily build projection emitters all over  holograms dont have to be limited to the holodeck  starships could also have mini turrets or phaser banks built into the corridors to fire upon invading forces  the computer can detect where anyone is, so why does it never detect unregistered crew and react  it could be set to monitor life signs, distress etc, and even weapons fire on board and send a hologram to ""see"" what is happening and report  
it's just absurd to me how easily the bad guys can just come on board and wreck the place  at least combat specialty holograms would give a starship crew a fighting chance in the event they get boarded ","despite being advanced in the future, ship security in star trek sucks "

2353,startrek,"a lot of people in star trek don't seem to grasp the basic truth about diplomacy    diplomacy only works if you are equal or more powerful then your enemies   or on rare occasions when they just happen to be sane and reasonable   but how often is that the case   if the federation was more powerful then the borg then they could negotiate a peace treaty with them   because the borg would know that if they didn't sign the treaty they would be wiped out   or that a war would cost them too much   so diplomacy only works if you are equal or more powerful then your enemies   otherwise diplomacy will fall on deaf ears   

if the federation really wants peace then they should start arming their ships better and preparing for war   if their neighbors think that a war will be too e expensive then they will be more inclined to want peace   this is why the romulans haven't gone to war with the federation in two centuries   in kirk's era he destroyed a bird of prey that was testing federation defenses   and in picard's era the alliance between the klingon empire and the federation kept the romulans at bay   so if the federation really wants peace it should start building more warships   

so that is the truth about diplomacy    if you have a bigger stick diplomacy will work   if not it will likely fall on deaf ears   so let me know what you think the comments ",the truth about diplomacy
2354,startrek,"it wouldn't hurt to see bashir and a few more genetically enhanced humans in a new star trek series or    maybe in picard's spin off  hence, the fact that bashir   the actor, not the character wants in on an episode of picard or a future trek series due to an article  i want to see genetically enhanced humans or g e h  within all the quadrants and maybe a comic between the q  sure    it could be a little dull because they would have some sort 100  success or lower of probability depending on the scenario   no such thing as no win scenario unless it wasn't realistic  they would also leave no margin for error  if the writers can do the same thing with data   which was accepting androids to an extent, i want to see them do the same thing with g e h  cause they did revive that concept in archer's time which lead to dr  soong's creation, data and lore   possibly khan, but it was never said, or so i think  

according to  moore, (  '""i kept saying 'what's the secret of bashir's past? what's the thing that this guy zimmerman is going to find that's so interesting?' i remember that ren  and i started talking about genetics, and ren  pointed out that genetic engineering is one of the things that is oddly missing in the star trek universe  it's a concept that's very much out there in science fiction, and even in the real world of science, but in star trek, it's virtually never discussed, aside from the fact that there was this thing called the eugenics wars at some point, and khan came out of it "" that conversation ultimately led moore to come up with the idea that bashir was genetically enhanced '

tl dr  i want to see more genetically enhanced humans in star trek  i want to see more than just a glimpse of the eugenics wars and if the genetically enhanced humans were ever actually accepted into society proving that they could actually function without causing wars like bashir, then i guess it could be fine  kind of like spock after genesis   which didn't change anything just his memory or maybe like terry mcginnis from batman beyond ",a new star trek involving more than just a couple of genetically enhanced humans

2367,startrek,"let s try this again 

the borg have a hive mind just like bees, ants and termites, they are social creatures and they act as one as one living organism 

  facts we know about how borg work   
1  they move as one, because they assimilate other species to be ""perfect"" 
2  they can communicate to each other and hear other voices all the time 
3  its a online connection that isn't broken unless they become a individual 
4  seven of nine got separated and was very scared and agitated to be apart from the collective 

  facts we know about how bees work   
1  they work as one single organism within the hive, as workers and drones 
2  they can communicate with each other through nothing more then a few  dancing  movements 
3  the connection between the bees is unbroken unless one gets separated from the hive and becomes an individual 
4  bees separated from their hive are known to sting people and animals which is a sign of them being scared or agitated 

hive minds don t literally have one single mind, they have individual connected minds that act like a single consciousness, each brain acts like the individual cells of a larger brain 

the borg queen literally control every drone as if they were puppets, in reality she is just the mouth piece for diplomatic purposes, she is even created by the drones themselves to function as a  mother  figure, we even see her die at least 3 times only to be replaced by a new queen  therefore the collective didn t  explode  on her death as they continued existing without her 

  some definitions of hive minds   
1  a notional entity consisting of a large number of people who share their knowledge or opinions with one another, regarded as producing either uncritical conformity or collective intelligence 
2  (in science fiction) a unified consciousness or intelligence formed by a number of alien individuals, the resulting consciousness typically exerting control over its constituent members 
3  the apparent consciousness of colonies of social insects such as ants, bees, and termites 

hive minds exist in earth, there s no reason to assume the borg hive mind would work differently 

so stop being a pakled, crying about the borg having a queen and being rude to anyone who likes the idea of a borg queen just because you misunderstood basic science when the borg were first introduced 

the borg with the queen not only fit the definition of a hive mind but acts in the same way hive minds act ",why the borg queen makes sense

who watches the watchers was actually the first tng episode that was pretty good   but   i had issues   

who watches the watchers stirred me up 

 gt troi  according to doctor barron's preliminary reports, the mintakans are proto vulcan humanoids at the bronze age level  quite peaceful and highly rational   
picard  which is not surprising, considering how closely their evolution parallels vulcan 

picard, you re an idiot  when the vulcans were in their bronze age they were skewering each other like crazy  they only got peaceful and rational after inventing space travel and nearly annihilating themselves in their own version of world war iii 

 gt crusher  before you start quoting me the prime directive, he'd already seen us  the damage was done  it was either bring him aboard or let him die   
picard  then why didn't you let him die?

picard, you re an asshole  i don t think i need to explain why 

 gt troi  mintakan emotions are quite interesting  like the vulcans, they have highly ordered minds  a very sensible people

oh thank you troi  what would we ever do without your insights 

 gt barron  picard, you must beam palmer aboard immediately  without medical attention  
picard  it's not as simple as that  he is surrounded by mintakans  if he dematerialises before their eyes, the impact  
barron  it will slightly increase the cultural contamination which already exists  a small price for saving palmer's life 

barron is of course right  just seeing an alien was enough to convince the villagers that something outside their experience is going on and the picard is real  it makes no difference if they see palmer vanish mysteriously or he vanishes mysteriously without anyone seeing it  and having an alien dead body or prisoner won t help either 

 gt picard  number one?  
picard   oc    is there any chance of your freeing palmer and transporting up unseen?  
riker  we can try   
picard   oc    try hard 

picard, you idiot  

 gt barron  like it or not, we have rekindled the mintakans' belief in the overseer   
riker  and are you saying that this belief will eventually become a religion?  
barron  it's inevitable  and without guidance, that religion could degenerate into inquisitions, holy wars, chaos   
picard  horrifying  doctor barron, your report describes how rational these people are  millennia ago, they abandoned their belief in the supernatural 

actually if it was that long ago they wouldn t even remember they ever had it 

 gt now you are asking me to sabotage that achievement, to send them back into the dark ages of superstition and ignorance and fear? no! we will find some way to undo the damage we've caused 

here is the fundamental problem with the episode  the mintakans have seen something they didn t comprehend and this has revived religion among them 

except 

  they live in the bronze age  

they see things they don t comprehend every day  every time they have an outbreak of infectious disease, or a lightning strike, or a meteor, rain, or the flipping sun rising in the morning they re seeing something they don t have an explanation for  humans in the bronze age invented gods for a reason  they didn t need alien astronauts to do it 

if the mintakans don t believe in gods it s because unlike humans they don t have a widespread need for gods  gods answer questions people aren t content to leave unanswered  without that need this  religion  certainly isn t going to spread beyond the actual eyewitnesses to the weirdness and even the eyewitnesses probably wouldn t conclude anything more than the basically accurate  there s a strange round eared tribe with powers we do not comprehend  

 gt picard  if you believe i am all powerful, then you cannot hurt me  if, however, i am telling the truth and i am mortal, you will kill me  but if the only proof you will believe is my death, then shoot   
nuria  liko, don't do it!  
oji  father, no!  
(oji jolts liko's arm enough to deflect the arrow into picard's shoulder  nuria holds up her blood stained hand to liko and he bursts into tears)

picard you idiot  what do osiris, baldr, herakles, quetzalcoatl, and jesus all have in common?

they all have stories  where they die  and are worshipped as gods anyway 

here s the thing  the episode from start to finish is tainted with subtle contempt for the mintakans because they aren t as technologically advanced as the humans for all of picard s pretensions to the contrary  do you know how kirk would have handled this problem? he would have beamed down, walked up to the village and said  you have a member of my tribe  could i please have him back?  he would have explained that his people were nomads who would soon be gone 

the problem would have been solved  but picard and the federation didn t have enough respect for the mintakans to deal with them as beings just as mentally capable as they are even though they don t have as many toys  so instead they treat the mintakans as children who need to be sheltered from any hint of reality and fumble around, making things worse at every turn  it s an insult to the mintakan intelligence and to that of the audience ",my rant about who watches the watchers

that being said, it is of course traumatic and exhausting, both mentally and physically, to care for a dying person 

science fiction has been my escape since middle school, and trek specifically since high school  generally my favorite episodes are the darkest ones (in the pale moonlight, yesterday's enterprise) 

because i am so physically and mentally drained, it is hard to think straight right now, and in particular my ability to recall is rather impaired  thankfully i am on fmla at work right now  but it is also making it more difficult to think of a more  uplifting  star trek episode that might help me escape for an hour or two, while not being so dark  because, for once, dark is not what i want or need  (yes, kirk was right when he said ""i  need  my pain,"" but that doesn't mean i need it 24 7)

2388,startrek,"so far we've seen some cool new tech in discovery that does feel like a big leap from what we've seen in earlier trek shows (programmable matter, floating nacelles etc )  however, am i the only one who finds it bizarre that weapons don't really seem to have advanced at all, in particular with torpedoes?

we saw earth use quantum torpedoes, however it looks like both starfleet and the emerald chain are still using photon torpedoes as their standard weaponry  i can just about buy into quantum torpedoes being the standard weapon, given it was an advanced new weapon in the late tng era  you can see how they may have refined that over a few centuries, then engaged in a temporal weapon arms race, before reverting back to conventional weapons (which didn't develop further during the temporal wars) due to the temporal accords   limited resources 

photon torpedoes however seemed to have reached their limits in the tng era, and we know from when discovery arrived at starfleet hq that hull technology has advanced significantly, so its hard to see how these would still be an effective weapon 

as for phasers, at least they've been intentionally more vague, but the effects still look like star wars style lasers from the earlier seasons of discovery, rather than more sophisticated beam style weaponry  it's like they couldn't be bothered to come up with new vfx 

it's rather frustrating, as surely this is a really easy thing for them to get right   just invent some new technobabble weaponry (like they did many times in the tng era) and don't elaborate on the details, as they have avoided doing consistently so far in discovery ",31st century weapons

the psychedelic references and visuals troughout the show 

the fact they even named paul stamets after one of my psychedelic heroes, namely the real paul stamets  (and consulted him) the referenses to psilocybin and visuals of the mycelium network makes it pretty clear the makers of discovery have seen some psychedelic realms themselves  the show is packed with obvious and hidden psychedelic references  and the trill episode was simply mind blowing  reminded me of ayahuascha  

although far fetched, i love the whole mycelium network thing and spore drive  besides i have loved anything related to time travel and alternative universe

in the approximate month the admiral has known of the discovery its had 3 or 4 incidents of insubordination or refusal of orders, and had already given saru a warning about his command that led to him making a green ensign 1st officer  from the outside discovery must seem chaotic and at risk of mutiny  now we have a situation where the captain backed tilly to his face and she failed at the first hurdle, which is not just bad for her reputation, its hugely damaging to how competent saru looks to a 32nd century observer, on top of what looks like pretty sketchy ability to follow basic chain of command stuff 

so in the next episode why isn't the admiral going to decide enough is enough on board his prize asset and bring the discovery home for some briefing that turns into demotions for the senior officers and mass reassignment for the crew? like the federation said when they met, only starmets is actually needed and refusing the transfers would only show hes right to break up the crew for being dangerously close to mutiny  and by now the federation must be well on the way to duplicating the drive, the spores and the pilot sp even stamets only has so much unique value ",why does the admiral trust discovery?

2438,startrek,"so i was going to comment this on another post, but ultimately decided to make my own post instead  also, disclaimer, i have seen tos and most of tng as well as most of the movies  otherwise, i haven't seen much else and so these arguments mainly apply to tos and tng, but can also refer to others  that also means that understandings of ethics from the writers are likely outdated and thus these missteps from my perspective may not be entirely their fault  (oh and this is all on mobile, so many apologies)

as we know, the use of the prime directive (pd) has been pretty inconsistently applied throughout the franchise, but from what i recall, they are nearly always false dilemmas rather than a true moral one  an episode centering around the pd usually centers around the following question  

do we interfere with a people's natural progression if it means helping them? 

when we talked about ethics in my classes (i went to grad school for anthropology so it was kinda important), this becomes an issue with two main dimensions  knowledge vs ignorance and life vs cultural purity  

an episode focusing on pd usually starts the plot where starfleet notices a problem that the native people have no way of noticing  let's say, a natural disaster  a ton of the episode is spent with the cast debating 1  whether to help at all and 2  if the people can be helped    secretly  but the actual people who would be affected almost never get input  it is as if because these people fail to meet arbitrary advancement requirements (space travel), they are treated as if they are incapable of making decisions on their own behalf  

this is the failing in how pd is treated in such episodes  the various cultures aren't any less intelligent just because they can't go to space  they simply lack access to the same information as starfleet does  if we applied that to current comparisons, that is like saying that a modern hunter gatherer is dumber because they can't drive a car (also assuming that if they had access to a car that they would even want to)  flipping that, it would be saying that anyone reading this post is dumb if they don't know how to identify safe and edible plants in the wild  the inca, a very complex civilization, never developed the concept of the wheel  did that make them any less intelligent? 

no it doesn't  so why does starfleet refuse to include them in discussions about their future? 

i'll get back to this, but first let me shift to the second part of the issue  life vs cultural purity  

yes, the act of contacting them in order to ask for their input would introduce concepts and technology that they may not be ready for, but this is like the trolley experiment  refusing to take action, resulting in larger loss of life than whatever sacrifices taking direct action would take is not a passive thing  the moment starfleet notices something will happen, anything they do at that point, even if it is to do nothing, is still a specific choice on their part  if starfleet truly wishes not to interfere, then they must also completely avoid those people  by observing, they are just setting themselves up to make these choices  if starfleet truly wanting nature to take its course, they will truly let these people be  but they don't  by observing them, they must accept that sometimes there are negative affects to doing such research  can't have your cake and eat it too  

literally the only reason not to help is because it will mess with the ""natural progession"" of the people in question  but that's    that makes a ton of assumptions  

if a cultural has any contact with starfleet, they will just    what? abandon their own culture and copy starfleet? that's an incredibly laughable concept, honestly  not only do people interact with those of other cultures all the time and not just 100  assimilate, but if they find ideas they do genuinely like, what's the harm in holding it back? it isn't like starfleet is colonizing the planet by saving them from a volcano  they aren't forcing these people to abandon everything they know and love  the native people will adopt what they want and keep what they want  this is the very common phenomenon called transculturation  ideas are shared between cultures all the time and all cultures involved change in some way because of it  

change isn't necessarily a bad thing  so why is it such a big deal in pd episodes? because looking at it from this perspective makes the whole argument shaky at best  ""if we save them, they will want to copy us  but we want them to be themselves so we won't even give them the choice of letting us help them "" 

pretty absurd to me  

so why does this come up a lot in trek? honestly, it is an easy way to give a moral dilemma on television  writers want these characters to be able to have ethical debates, but also want them to be universally loved  so the solution is to paint the issue as more grey than it truly is so that when the characters do make the ""right"" decision, it is hard fought  if they make the ""wrong"" one, then it is more excusable  win win for the writers  

personally, i think the true ethical debate would be, if after such a culture is contacted, they refuse the help for whatever reason  now that would be very difficult since the starfleet characters in question know they can help, but are required to respect the decision of the planet's inhabitants  what the characters do would be good insights into them as individuals, honestly  and if such an episode exists, please point me to it so i can see it play out ",the prime directive  a false dilemma

gagh is alien in origin, it did not evolve on q'onos, but was instead an invasive species of ""blight"" from the hur'q homeworld  it is revered in klingon society because kahless was the first klingon to use his weapons as farm tools to grow food from the land instead of relying on a hunter gatherer way of life to survive  this basically kicked off a ""neolithic revolution"" that was instrumental to the klingons resisting and eventually ""overthrowing"" the hur'q 

this theory is a combination of multiple theories 

assumption 1  the klingons are a race of obligate carnivores  they need relatively fresh meat to sustain themselves 

assumption 2  the klingons were a slave game race created by the hur'q

conclusion  gagh is the only real klingon food that can be mass produced as a staple ""crop""  prior to its domestication, klingons were pack hunters with total local populations too small to effect any real resistance to the hur'q invasion due to the basic limits of how needing prey animals to eat the available plant life before you can eat the animals looses  90 of the total food energy a given area can produce ","gagh is so revered in klingon culture because worms are the only thing a species of obligate carnivores can effectively ""farm"""

2450,startrek,"when you ve been watching the show for years and you know the plot   and their mission   by heart it can be easy to forget how cleverly this episode is written  

in almost every episode the audience knows exactly what s going on from beginning to end  and it s because we re seeing the whole episode through the eyes of the senior command  we start with picard s log entry telling us what their mission is  we get to see all the staff meetings, the mission briefings, etc  

but in this episode   and this is the part you can easily forget if you ve been watching this for 25 years like i have   the audience knows almost nothing about what s going on for almost the entire episode  the ship is near the cardassian border   there s some escape pod they need to get and there s a lot of secrecy about who s in it   picard needs a certified pilot   laforge is doing some kind of strange  tests  involving phaser fire on a shuttlecraft and he doesn t appreciate observations that it looks like they re faking damage to a fleeing vessel   there s an injured cardassian   that s about it  it s really a mystery to the audience what s going on and that s because we re seeing the mission through the eyes of the junior officers, all of whom are only told whatever they need to know to carry out their assigned tasks  

it s only at ensign sito s mission briefing that we really find out what s going on  that s more than halfway through the episode  it s very atypical for a trek episode but extremely appropriate for this one ",lower decks (the tng episode) is brilliantly written

who are they making this show for?",this  gray  character in discovery is like  gazoo  in the flintstones
2452,startrek,"ok so the discovery was boarded and osyraa took over but why didn't tilly just activate a command level override to protect the ship and lock it down the moment she knew something was up that way osyraa would never have gotten her hands on the ship 

i know its probably a plot point for the next episode but it seems like such a plot hole for me ",one thing i don't understand discovery 3x11
2453,startrek,"so i just decided to start watching the franchise considering netflix has a seemingly large portion of it, and i just finished the og series  i have to say it leaves a lot to be desired despite planting the seeds of a good franchise and i felt like doing a write up of what i liked and disliked  it's enjoyable enough, but it's certainly a product of its times 

i'll start off with some things i really like 

  spock is a great character  when odd stuff happens to make him laugh or show other emotions you actually have a sense that this is unnatural  probably the best character in the series
  bones is also pretty great  he's kind of the heart of the enterprise and even though you don't always agree with his ideas you understand where his opinions come from  i really liked the episode where he got the terminal disease and married the alien woman  i was kinda hoping the two did just go off and have him retire  (what happened to that disease anyway? dangling plot thread unless i missed something)
  the episode where they test the computer as the new ship controller was actually really funny because it called kirk out how he always sends himself, spock, and bones instead of crewmen like a normal military mission would be  obviously this is what happens cuz it's tv, but it would make it a bit more realistic if he wasn't the vanguard 24 7 
  uhura is by far the best female as she actually does important stuff  i recently rewatched an episode of comicbook men where her actress visited and it was interesting hearing that she almost quit but was asked to stay by martin luther king jr 
  young george takei  that is all
  i also enjoy the general premise of the series, even if it's just to allow for an indefinite episodic storyline

now let's get into some issues i have with it 

  first, a small complaint i have is the general lack of military esque things  this is supposed to be a military ship and checkov has a beatles bowl cut  i don't know why but that small detail bothers me so much  at least his russia obsession is amusing  there's also a large lack of competency when people fight on the show, so that's not so fun to watch
  just about every kirk random woman dynamic is annoying and repetitive  the only one i found endearing was his native american wife baby momma, and the first few love interests weren't that bad  but most of the latter ones are just intolerable  most of those episodes can be summarized by ""kirk and co  find bad people  kirk seduces alien woman  betraying the woman saves the day, and they must abandon their spark despite their feelings""  it's so boring and i hate it  remember that time an alien sabotaged the ship just to makeout with kirk? haha     yeah       
  american earthly parallels  this would have been interesting if it was once or twice  but it's happened like five times and it's so horribly contrived  also, the intimate detail kirk had about the cowboy time period was so stupid  spock i could believe, but that was a pretty ridiculous episode  while we're on the topic, the one with abraham lincoln was also not too great  that entire storyline would have been amazing if lincoln was replaced with a made up galactic or interplanetary war hero general  but it being an american president is just so so so lazy and frustrating 
  unsatisfying endings  some of these episodes just leave you thinking ""so that was it? wtf""  to name a few  the one where kirk's wife just dies, pretty much anytime they encounter romulans, when they just let the alien who stole a shuttle go cuz his people were dead, and the episode where klingons arm some primitive people  that last one in particular was super upsetting, because everything was absolutely unresolved  did they really just say ""oh well, guess the prime directive was right haha"" and leave the planet? that doesn't even make any sense
  the women's outfits  this just bothers me  they're not practical at all, and in the first few episodes it's like some of the women's only job is to attend to the captain  i don't get this one at all  also the episode where they're eating dinner and keep telling the ambassador she's beautiful is very     awkward and plain uncomfortable to be honest 
  technology like bones' little scanner is just ridiculous  this is another of those ""product of its time"" things, but i just roll my eyes when he waves it over someone for 2 seconds and makes a thorough medical analysis  the phrase ""he's dead jim"" will haunt me forever

all in all, i think the series sets up a good universe for the future series and introduces some good characters  i'm looking forward to watching the rest of the franchise after i power through the animated episodes next  what is the general consensus on the best series? worst?",new star trek watcher thoughts on the original

2463,startrek,"a while back i made a post asking why chakotay episodes are so boring  a few people told me that season 7 s shattered was the exception, and i m happy to say they were right  shattered is a fantastic episode  

i think the reason it works so well is because it s not just a chakotay episode  it s a chakotay and janeway episode  chakotay s character works best when he s interacting with others, and his bond with janeway is my favorite because they have such a great relationship  even when separated by 7 years they still are able to bond and trust each other, and that love is shown here so well  

shattered also works because it s an episode that relies on series continuity, which voy typically lacks  this is the one episode that really rewards you for watching everything and sticking by the series for 7 seasons  

side note i m still bitter they didn t become a couple  it was already written all you had to do was make it canon writers! this isn t even a case of the time period because it was a m f relationship  there was no reason they couldn t become a thing  seven and chakotay is bs (i m a multishipper so i like most ships but that one and spock uhura i just cannot enjoy  respect to those that do though) ",why voy s  shattered  works as a chakotay episode

2476,startrek,"i understand how dangerous time travel is   and why the federation would want to ban it   but what right do they have to impose that ban on the whole galaxy   and having one law or treaty that says you can't do something no matter the situation is too rigid   the use of time travel should be judged like prime direction violations   on a case by case basis   if the temporal accord had been around in the 23rd century do you think kirk would have sat on his hands and said oh i want to stop earth from being annihilated by an alien probe   but i can't because of the temporal accord   of course not he would have gone back in time anyway    why because it is the right thing to do 

but according to the temporal accord kirk should have been immediately thrown in jail   even though he didn't alter the timeline   then there was that one guy who traveled from the kelvin timeline and into the future   who the federation let die painfully instead of sending him back to his universe   because of the temporal accord   when rules and laws becomes so rigid that they are willing to sacrifice people like that then they have become too rigid   there should be reasonable exceptions for the use of time travel   

also does the federation plan on forcing this accord on everyone in the galaxy   who gave them the right to do that   what about aliens who use time travel but with the consent of their people and they don't effect the history of the federation or anyone else   are starfleet ships going to show up over their planet and force them to sign the temporal accord   that would be tyrannical   that said those who do use time travel as a weapon against others should be dealt with   and should not be tolerated   the temporal accord does that by prohibiting time travel regardless of the situation   which is way to rigid   

if the federation can't be reasonable with it's laws and treaties then it should expect members to just outright ignore them and non members to refuse to sign them   that being said their should time travel watchdogs who track malicious use of time travel while almost ignoring non malicious use of time travel   and each incident should be judged on a case by case basis   if they can't do this then they become a tyrannical organization and something that should be opposed  

also notice how the federation ignores the temporal accord when it's inconvenient   if they were to follow it to the letter then discovery's crew would be in the brig   but they want their spore drive so they let a group of time travlers roam free   risking a temporal war if the other factions find out about it   so they don't even follow the temporal accord when it benefits them to not do so   but letting a man die painfully instead of sending him back to his universe that didn't benefit them to break the temporal accord so they didn't   but discovery's spore drive does so they will break the temporal accord to use it   so they are hypocrites 

so the bottom line is if they can't be sane and judge time travel use like prime directive violations on a case by case basis then they are the bad guys   so let me know what you think in the comments ",i am not a fan of the temporal accord

2502,startrek,"so this recent episode of discovery has given us who and what caused the burn and a lot of people are not amazed by it  but what i think is that the burn isn't the big reveal as we are thought to believe but in fact the federation has been infiltrated by the chain  the burn happened the same time in another alternate universe where the federation has crumbled but being how admiral archer has help win the temporal cold war the federation has bought some time to exist  i think in the temporal war the federation has lost badly and as a result this was their ultimate fate to be no more  some how in this future dilithum would be its down fall, because if they could not destroy earth in the temporal cold war they could destroy what is the federation as a whole  none of its key planets are in it and even so the klingons aren't even mentioned as to which gives hint they too have suffered from a loss of that war being how the orions are causing havoc  i think someone has helped altered events to make sure the federation would be obsolete but the error they made was dilithum 

now i think admiral vance and book are working with the chain and that is why discovery has been compromised because they have planted devices to help track the ship and its capabilities to osyraa  how come she knows discovery has a spore drive? how come she knew where discovery was? also why has book been so keen on joining starfleet? i think book and vance was feeding information to her behind their backs  the admiral also has been very hesitant on finding out the cause of their burn   this also begs the question or even a trip down memory lane as to when micheal found discovery, gergiou knew something was up with her and when she beamed back to discovery she was giving her the cold shoulder  lets add on to the fact that  saru and tilly suspected something off with her when she got back  a year can be a long time, but when you're an adult a year isn't very long to let go on something or someone  i suspect micheal isn't who she is and she's something else, maybe the grudge?  

i would also like to add on about what happened to georgiou, she needed to go back in time because of her time traveling dilemma  she started having her issues as soon as kovich interrogated her but she also knew something was up with the federation because how could they let something like the burn happen or even figure it out in 125 years? 

also time travel is banned but who or what is keeping tabs on who or what time travels?  lets also add who can detect who or what time travel? 

my theory is this, the federation is and was compromised by the chain but they were only able to do to altered events which made the federation lose the temporal war  kovich is actually starfleet section 31 who knew georgiou needed to be sent back to make sure she can give info on what was the fate of the federation 1000 years from where ever she was sent back to  also micheal, book, and vance are not who they say they are  i think discovery has to go back in time again to try and prevent some events from happening because all we know is that the chain has over taken the federation as whole by next episode ",theories and speculation in disco

yesterday we learned that at the center of the burn is a planet made of dilithium  when the crew sees this somebody (i can't remember who) says something to the effect of ""this would solve the scarcity problem"" and everyone seems to think this solves the dilithium problem  book even says ""the galaxy just got a whole lot smaller ""

now obviously this is true    for awhile  but reliance on any non renewable recourse is inherently a temporary solution  assuming the entire planet is made of dilithium it should be easy to calculate how long this one planet will last  but consider that the federation had many dilithium mining planets  and those only lasted about 1,000 years  when you consider that for the early part of that time there were much fewer ships, and the majority of the dilithium was coming from earth's moon alone for the first 100 years this doesn't seem like a lot  by the time of the burn the federation also included klingon space, and likely cardassian and romulan space too  that's a lot of dilithium  and all 350 member wolds spend what, 100 years trying to find an alternative  and only one almost solution was found that was deemed to dangerous?

and now it's not just the federation's supply of dilithium, but the entire galaxy's  the federation is setting itself up to fail  the entire galaxy knows that in x years there will be no more dilithium and everything will go back to the way it was  even the spore drive needs dilithium crystals to carry power 

now you may say ""but isn't that how our world works right now?"" to which i say yes, it is  and look at where that's been taking us for the past century  how hopeful is the average person about the state of the world in 100 years time? plus the people of star trek have been shown to clearly understand the problems with this kind of dependence  even in the days of enterprise 

so my question is, is this planet a solution at all or is it just a 1 200 year temporary fix? remember i'm assuming 100  of the planet is pure dilithium, but that planet didn't look purple and crystal y to me ",how much dilithium would it take to fix the scarcity issue?

i wonder if maybe discovery shouldn't have found starfleet hq, and had been forced to tackle a hostile galaxy with only the sphere ai and spore drive as their main advantage  then it would make slightly more sense for them to constantly get  effortlessly  owned by scavengers and travelling salesmen with future tech and tactics ",discovery in season 3 (spoilers for s03e11   sukal)

2518,startrek,"i was on  trekmovie com ( reading some comments by the trek fans , the comment was about jj abrams 

 amp  x200b 

a fan said, it was good jj abrams got his karma for ditching star trek to go do star wars when he was still under contract by paramunt to do a trek 3 after into darkness 

the fan said, it was karma for jj abrams because the  disney trilogy has turned out to be a disaster and rise of skywalker  not only sort of bombed but became seen  as the worst star wars film, the trek fan said this has hurt jj abrams remutation but he deserved it for jumping ship simply because star wars was more popular  

 amp  x200b 

please what do you trek fans on reddit think? i do know trek fans sometimes feel differently on different  trek sites ",did jj abrams get get what he deserved for leaving trek for star wars
2519,startrek,"the character isn't written or portrayed even remotely offensively, so does that just make her a deus ex machina?  or does she still kinda qualify within the meta narrative (i'm not sure i'm using this term properly) of the show?  did roddenberry or have the actors spoken about this?",do you think whoopi goldberg's character guinan (i love her portrayal) qualify as a 'magical negro' trope?
2520,startrek,"so in the episode shore leave they encounter a planet that literally makes their dreams come to life   they later decide to make it into a resort   by tng era however people regularly have holodecks so is it still worth it?  

i think it maybe because in some ways is much better   for one you don't have to program it, the planet just scans your mind for you to create what you want  also a holodeck program is only as good as the programmer can make it  there maybe flaws that the user sees that the programmer didn't   you get everything you want on the fantasy planet 

however holodecks only act when you program to   the downside to the fantasy planet is it makes any you think come to life   try to clear your mind and you may run into the stay puff marshmallow man   not only that but it isn't just you who generates fantasies   anyone you are with or who is already there are doing it as well   so if someone dreams of a dinosaur watch out    

in the episode we meet  yeoman tonia barrows who is kinkest person ever to join starfleet!  her fantasy is for some medieval knight to show up, fight to win her, kidnap her, and rip her dress off   she was the only one of this crew to have an abduction fetish, but you get a whole ship load down and i think some really crazy stuff might start happening because it only takes one person to think of it

  episode 40   ""su'kal""  

  this is the first episode since ""raijin"", and fifteenth overall, to have a title consisting only of a character's name  partial matches since then include ""the trouble with edward,"" ""ephraim and dot,"" and ""much ado about boimler ""
  a portrait of the  uss clarke  is displayed on the mess room wall  the  clarke  was destroyed at the battle of the binary stars 
  nebulae are commonly used by ships to hide from other ships  it's less common that a nebula or nebula like region is actively harmful or dangerous to vessels, but examples include the mcallister nebula in ""chain of command,"" the nebula in ""one,"" the briar patch from  insurrection,  the necro cloud in  beyond  (the latter two of which also contained planets inside), and the expanse from ent's third season  occasionally a nebula is found to be a living creature, as was the case in ""bliss ""
  dr  notculber appears to double as a veterinarian to care for grudge  dr  crusher and dr  phlox were conscripted into the same role when tending to spot and porthos, respectively 
  an inordinate amount of time is spent on the crew worrying about the safety of the away team, as though it weren't a routine part of the job  picard had to weigh his feelings for commander daren against sending her on a dangerous mission in ""lessons ""
  tilly cites her ""granny adele "" captain picard had an aunt adele who gained fame for her homeopathic sleep remedies 
  occasionally away teams are cosmetically altered to resemble native species (""first contact"" et al ) or to spy on enemies (""the enterprise incident"" et al )  doug jones' appearance without his heavy makeup evokes ""far beyond the stars"" in which the usually alien crew appear as humans 
  holodecks in the 24th century were also capable of projecting custom skins on their users  later we see the radiation affecting the away team, which is curious since the program would presumably hide all of that  saru also complains about a human fear of heights, suggesting he is ""actually"" human, but this could just be psychosomatic 
  the holodeck appears to be malfunctioning  this only happened once before, in ""elaan of troyius ""
  the recreation of the kaminar admission ceremony includes two aliens, one who looks like a saurian with smaller eyes and another with six tentacles protruding from its head and a double fu manchu  i would not be surprised if these were more examples of ""use aliens seen in the background of a deleted scene of one movie and see if the nerds notice"" but i am unable to identify them  the starfleet uniforms and badges are unfamiliar and are likely meant to evoke a random period in federation history between the pic era and the burn 
  book hypothesizes that osyraa used a transwarp conduit to find them  transwarp conduits are hyperspatial corridors used by the borg to fast travel across the galaxy 
  it is revealed that  discovery  now has a cloaking device  in the crew's home century, cloaking technology had not been achieved by the federation, and in the 24th century the federation was barred by the treaty of algeron from using it except under certain circumstances  with the romulans now reunified with the vulcans, it makes sense that the treaty is no longer in effect  it is remarked that the ship cannot spore jump while cloaked, adding to a list of things cloaked ships can't do for plot convenience 
  issa created a holoprogram to take care of su'kal  this is very similar to the situation in ""future imperfect ""
  the theme and motif of the holoprogram felt to me not so much a holodeck episode but more of an ""enter a character's mind"" episode like ""extreme measures"" or ""dark page "" out of canon, it also reminded me of 80s fantasy films like  the dark crystal,   mio in the land of faraway  and  labyrinth  (or, more relevantly, its similarly named 2006 spiritual successor, which also featured monsters, doug jones, and a haunting lullaby) 
  tilly hides behind sigmund freud as a defense mechanism  freud previously appeared in ""phantasms ""
  osyraa grabs the  discovery  with tentacles, as the pakleds did in ""no small parts "" that episode was produced after this one so technically the callback is reversed 
  starships are hijacked by outside forces in ""basics,"" ""one little ship,"" ""rascals,"" and others ","canon references   ""su'kal""  spoilers "
2537,startrek,,star trek  discovery actor mary wiseman has a few choice words for body shaming  haters 
2538,startrek,in the last episode of discovery the chain was able to beam aboard discovery and take over the ship   this scenario is easily avoided by putting transporter scramblers throughout the ship   also being able to quickly activate the self destruct or at the very least lock out control of the ship would be a good idea   also being able to quickly lock on to anyone who isn't part of the crew and beam them into space wold be another good option   they could also modify the artificial gravity so that it increases five or ten times for anyone who isn't part of the crew   that would neutralize a boarding party pretty easily   so why is their security always so horrible   let me know what you think in the comments ,why don't federation ships have better security?

anyway i was frankly not into the first season at all  it was depressing, did not feel like trek one bit, was overly futuristic for a time period that was supposed to be before tos, and i didn t like any of the characters  plus it was just too complicated, and frankly not a fan of the plot  and don t get me started on those weird klingons lol like what was that? anyway  

second season, with the arrival of pike, and slight change of tone and resolutions of certain discrepancies between the trek we know and that (klingons back to normal, tech explanations like holograms etc ) a slightly more positive vibe   i started to get into it  in fact i m really looking forward to strange new worlds!! 

i do miss lorca though   he was one thing i loved about season 1  i wish they brought back his prime universe version or something  

then season 3 arrived and wow    just wow!! the future is incredible and i love that there is just nothing we can say about how it doesn t fit with the rest of trek technology wise now because it s just so far ahead  i love that we re seeing completely new territory, in a way that makes sense  the tone has gotten so much more positive and i m really feeling the true trek vibes now  so much emotion! so much hope! okay i m not done i m only at episode 6 so don t spoil but    so far    amazing

2592,startrek,"why do so few planets in star trek have planetary defenses   we've seen a few planets that had decent planetary defenses   the planetary shield and defense grid over earth in discovery was impressive   but for the most part few planets have planetary defenses   why is that?  considering the federation's history of war and conflict (for an organization devoted to peace they do get into a lot of wars) you would think their member worlds would have planetary defenses 

a planetary defense grid is much cheaper then building a fleet of starships   because they don't need warp drive, just a few thrusters to keep them from falling out of orbit, their much smaller then most ships, and they aren't used often so the energy cost is low   a planetary shield is an even better option if you have the power and technology   but even without a shield a planetary defense grid can take out a fleet of ships   

another option is mines   self replicating mines if you have the technology   you could build the mines in space and when your expecting unwanted guests you could have them maneuver into position or beam them into position   that way you have several layers of defenses between a fleet of enemy ships and the planet   ground to space cannons are also a good option   so that even if ships get past the orbital defenses they still get blown out of the sky from the cannons on the ground 

most of these planetary defenses are cheap   mines and orbital weapon platforms are easy to build   a planetary shield would be more difficult but possible   with the proper planetary defenses you could hold off the entire klingon or romulan fleet   maybe even both   so considering the federation's history of war they should start equipping their member worlds with effective planetary defense systems   the dominion war would have turned out differently if most federation worlds had effective planetary defenses   the dominon fleet would have been wiped out over batazed instead of conquering the planet   so the federation really help their member worlds defend themselves better   that they are prepared for future wars ",planetary defenses

2595,startrek,"what i always thought was that the enterprise, during its five years mission, travelled across a tiny portion of space, regarding the size of the federation (which expands in the alpha and beta quadrants) and the size of the klingon empire( that could even be more larger) 

therefore, it could be understandable that mutated klingons, seen as misfits, would be sent altogether to the same part of the galaxy  they would still be part of the empire, working to continue its expansion, but far from the ""normal"" klingons as if they were sent into exile  that would explain why the enterprise ran into the same ""faces"" and also it would explain why we don't get to see any mutated klingon in discovery 

that said, it's my personal hypothesis  it would be great to see those old school klingons at least once in strange new worlds  i hope the writers will provide a good tie in between discovery and tos in that matter ",writers working on strange new worlds could provide an explanation for why the only klingons that are shown to us in tos are mutated klingons

i never did get into star trek enterprise when that was on tv or didn't watch discovery when that premiered a couple of years ago  i did watch star trek picard which i loved, so i got an idea of how things will look in discovery for the most part, so as the title says, is now a good time to start watching or will i not enjoy it because of the connection i still have with tng era and crew?","as a huge tng fan, is now a good time to watch star trek discovery?"

2610,startrek,"    is the fact that, until ""balance of terror"", nobody in the federation knew that the romulans were related to the vulcans   no human had ever seen a romulan before so they didn't know they had the same appearance   the romulan commander's appearance was even a surprise to spock   it was a major part of the backstory that during the federation romulan war from a century before, there were no visual communications, and they only talked by radio 

what gets me, is that back during ""enterprise"", archer's crew had even heard romulans speak, untranslated   in the reboot movies, alternate uhura could even speak romulan    all three dialects of it    and stated she was about the only human who could distinguish spoken romulan from spoken vulcan 

considering that t'pol was a native vulcan, and sato could also speak vulcan without the assistance of the ut (which she herself could program, anyway)    nobody thought to mention that these sight unseen hostile aliens were speaking a nearly indistinguishable version of a language that was spoken by earth's only alien allies of the moment?  and the fact of that significant similarity did not get passed down through the war, which was a major inciting incident for the founding of the federation?

specifically in one episode (i just started season 3, so first two seasons spoilers  fairly mild) kira and obrien raid a cardassian prison camp and shoot multiple guards  being in open combat, i assumed these guards were killed  later in the episode tribunal, o brien stated he has not killed any cardassians since the war  is he lying, or had he genuinely stunned the guards? how long does a stun last? i understand the diplomatic reasons to stun rather than kill, but isn't it tactically risky?

my other reason for asking is if you're being shot at, do you have any ability to determine the level of firepower you're being hit with? short of checking vitals on someone who has been hit, do you have any indication whether their weapons are set to lethal mode?","is there any way to tell a phasers setting?

if you haven't watched it lately (it was my first time today), the basic premise is that there is an androgenous race that has no genders since in the past the have ""evolved"" to be a single gender  however, some people are still born with gender tendencies such as male female feelings and identities  these people are hunted down, socially punished, and ostracized until they publicly admit that they are non gendered like everyone else  one such person self identifies as female, and she is put on trial for it  some very interesting quotes arising from that scene 

sorin  ""i am tired of lies  i am female  i was born that way  i have had those feelings, those longings all of my life  it is not unnatural  i am no sick because i feel this way  i do not need to be helped  i do not need to be cured  what i need, and what all of those who are like me need, is your understanding and your compassion  we have not injured you in any way, and yet we are scorned and attacked, all because we are different  what we do is no different from what you do  we talk  and laugh  we complain about work, and we wonder about growing old  we talk about our families and we worry about the future  and we cry with each other when things seem hopeless  all of the loving things that you do with each other, that is what we do  and for that, we are called misfits and deviants, and criminals  what right do you have to punish us? what right do you have to change us? what makes you think you can dictate how people love each other?""

also i have to wonder if she would have been punished if she had fired and the klingons backed off   if someone were to mutiny and stop a war would they still be thrown in the brig   regardless you have to give burnham credit   she mutinied knowing it would ruin her career   because she beloved it was the right thing to do   she didn't mutiny for selfish reasons   and that should have been considered before she was handed a life sentence   they make her out to be a monster when she was just trying to stop a war   so i think blaming her for the klingon war is ridiculous ",why is michael burnham blamed for the klingon war?

thoughts? i am aware that there is that beam that gets rid of holograms, but you could modulate the shields ahead of time to stop that, knowing that would erase your crew  also, i am aware of the glitches, but the doctor is a model 1 holograms, not intended for all he does  he is beyond his programming and i would thank model 4 or 5 would be more robust and have backup programming, if the primary fails  you also would surely have to have a programmer or engineer or two to manage all of them  plus, no food or atmosphere needed  the doctor could literally be on the outside of the ship doing repairs as they coast  i am just imaging the possibility   ","voyager ""the doctor"" fan boyish post"

after all, its not even clear what governments still existed in the 2060s post ww3 and to what extent their writ ran and communications were possible  for example, did the vulcans have to effectively reconnect the chaotic remnants of the world themselves did they have to do multiple first contacts with multiple governments (and if so did they all go peacefully or did vulcan have to disarm some human militaries?) and where they didnt exist, assist in reconstituting some governments on a provisional basis effectively rebuilding and uniting an entire world from scratch, is something of a tall order even for an advanced society like vulcan

2713,startrek,"i feel that our literature, tv and cinema have always served as a reflection of our culture and i sincerely believe that over the life of the franchise, star trek is simply a better reflection  let me start by acknowledging the controversial nature of this view within the hardcore geek community, but i encourage a spirited debate  although i ll concede that star trek and the next generation (tng) adhere to the same general naval exploration theme with predictable plots and outcomes (both series were written and directed by gene roddenberry), i find that the rest of the franchise does much to break this mold    disclaimer   there are naturally several ""spoilers"" in the article to follow   

starting with deep space nine (the first series after roddenberry s death) we see a significant departure from the previous star trek model  ds9 largely abandons the naval theme of the previous series and explores the concept of the castle doctrine (the military principle of projecting strength from a central base or port)  at the time of ds9's release, most american military experience and doctrine was focused on strength through maneuver rather than castle doctrine  it wasn t until the global war on terror (gwot) that most americans intuitively understood the principles of fighting from centralized bases  the series also dedicates much of the story line to exploring the ideas of asymmetric warfare and insurgency  in the years before gwot, these concepts were generally unexplored within us media making the show almost prophetic  lastly, ds9 was also the first star trek series with any meaningful exploration of the subject of religion (roddenberry was an avowed atheist and considered religion to be largely superstition)  i found captain sisko's journey from disbelief in his own role in the bajoran religion to his eventual acceptance of the 'prophets' to be extraordinarily insightful 

the next series in the franchise was voyager and it largely expands on the moral dilemmas introduced in ds9  we see that the prime directive is no longer sufficient to provide guidance in a gritty and honest plot line  we find the crew of voyager struggling with the morality of doing the wrong thing for the right reason and sacrificing the good of others for the sake of self preservation  i found the early theme of cultural interference to be fascinating  the crew of voyager are faced with the eternal decision of helping a developing society or allowing them to suffer through the natural evolution of their circumstances  this can be seen in parallel to several modern geo political situations that we find ourselves in today  very insightful and thought provoking situations resulting in no right decision, but many wrong ones  i found the alliance with the borg late in the series to be a believable and interesting take on ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" situation and reminiscent of the forced alliance between the american and soviet militaries in wwii  i also find captain janeway's character to be the most fully articulated star fleet captain of the franchise to date 

next came star trek enterprise  easily my favorite series in the star trek universe  for the first time, we see a meaningful exploration into the limitations that logistics impose into military maneuver and operations  most military leaders acknowledge that logistics is often the difference between success and failure on the battlefield, but up until this point, the writers of star trek had largely ignored the subject (i recognize that voyager did explore this subject to a limited extent, but enterprise made it a more regular theme)  we also see an interesting take on anti imperialism in the human resentment of the vulcans for  holding them back   this can be paralleled to us efforts to influence shape other nations yet keep them reliant on american support  lastly we see captain archer spend his entire life trying to escape his father s legacy only to discover in the end that he himself is the pivotal historical figure that all humans (and the federation in general) will later immortalize 

please feel free to add to the discussion  i look forward to hearing feedback from both star wars and star trek encampments ",star trek is more insightful than star wars

2734,startrek,at the end of season two discovery could have just jumped to the delta quadrant instead of traveling to the future   they could have jumped to earth to warn starfleet about contrrol and then jumped to the delta quadrant   if they had jumped to where voyager was thrown by the caretaker it would take a federation starship of that era almost two hundred years to reach them   their ships were pretty slow back then   they made a lot of progress with warp drive between then and the mid 24th century   so they could have jumped to the delta quadrant and waited for starfleet to wipe out control   this is a way better plan then the insane plan they came up with   so anyway let me know what you think in the comments ,why didn't discovery jump to the delta quadrant

2736,startrek,"hi folks!  


i'm totally new to trek and really want to dive in and watch it all  i also thought it would be fun to run a podcast, so i'm discussing hosting one with a friend and chatting about each episode as i go   


as someone who knows next to nothing about trek (and is trying to avoid spoiling anything) i'm just wondering if anyone has a suggestion for a show logo  my idea was to call it cadets, referencing starfleet cadets, and to have the logo banners visually reference trek cadets in some way  from a quick google image search though, i couldn't find anything that specifically identifies cadets  in tng it seems as though they share the same red colour as the command folks   


so my question is, can anyone point me to a colour scheme insignia from any trek generation (although earlier is preferable) where someone familiar with trek would see it and say ""oh that's the cadet colours symbol from the  _ _ _ _ series""  does something like this exist? it wouldn't even need to be a starfleet cadet, that's just my initial idea  if there is an example of another race or organization with a recognisable symbol for students, that's cool too   


it's 4am here so i'll be sleeping as soon as i post this  if there are any questions i'll get to them when i wake up

2737,startrek,"in trying to locate it, i found this archived thread   

and thought i would give this a whirl  so here goes 

as far as i remember, it was a shareware game included in the usual 1990s cd rom of ""50 "" or ""256!"" shareware freeware games one could find  

it was, iirc, an unofficial star trek dos adventure game that was in first person, reminiscent of tos or tas in graphics  however, the first puzzle of the game was simply to find a way to leave the room and i never did, so i would just look around the room and get foiled by the single door and then quit the game 

i figured at the time my computer was incompatible for some reason so i could not find ordinary controls, or my intuition was terrible or it was an ""escape room"" involving a scotty like cutting of the wall to hack the door mechanism  does anyone recall this game? was it anything more than a single room, and was it gloriously shareware as i suspected but could never confirm?",trying to find an unofficial first person (escape room?) shareware game

2739,startrek,"okay so let me explain what i mean  

so i ve been obsessed with tng my whole adult life and, like most of you, i admire captain picard  patrick stewart is magnificent in this role and i ve always looked at picard as the father i always wanted instead of my back woods, gun loving father  

that being said, i finally took the plunge and tried another star trek series, namely voyager, and holy shit, janeway is all over every mission  she s on away missions, she s working with the engineer to find a solution to the problem at hand, she comes up with ideas during their group sessions she s all over the fucking place  and i gotta say, i m here for it  

when going back to watch an episode of tng, picard comes off as lazy by comparisons  don t get me wrong, i m not throwing any shade because picard will always be an iconic figure in my life, it s just amazing to me that i never realized how little he actually did when the time came  

anyways, i found it pretty funny to compare the two and i love them both for who they are  can t wait to continue with voyager! i don t know why i let it take me so long  on to ds9 next!",just started watching voyager and man does janeway make picard look like a slacker!

2743,startrek,"mandalorian is a huge success, and fans love it  it has revived the love of starwars for many and rescued the franchise after the disaster that was the sequel trilogy 

does that sound familiar? the new trek movies in jj era aren't as bad as st but they leave a lot to be desired  and the new shows are worse 

what mandalorian did was show that 'old school' storytelling, characters, heart, vision and passion, can still work  

most importantly, it was done by people who know sw and care about it   its not a show created by hacks like kurtzman, and written by a room of writers whose goal is to stuff it full of every modern cliche and tick every pc box  again,   exactly   like how the new st movies were done 

jj movies dsc pic are the equivalent of what jj kennedy riann did to starwars   best forgotten 

mandalorian is starwars, it evokes the same feelings  we need a trek show with the values of trek   hope, exploration, optimism 

(here come the usual complaints about 'it must be new !!', 'you must adapt to modern times and appeal to current agendas !!', 'it can't be more of the same !!')

in the latest episode, georgiou is sent to an unspecified time when the mirror and prime universes were not that far apart  given narrative in the rest of discovery indicates there hasnt been a crossing in over 500 years (speaking from the 31st century), and given that the majority of documented crossings span the 22nd century (enterprise) the 23rd century (tos and dis) and the 24th century (tng, ds9), then it seems plausible that this 200 year period is the target setting for the new section 31 show starring georgiou 

what is your preferred time and event?

personally, i think the new show should effectively act as the sadly never made season 5 of enterprise, which as the build up set in season 4 makes clear, was supposed to chart the opening of the earth romulan war  afterall, war settings are generally the best use of a spy agency in a dramatic setting, 

it also gives the show the chance to go into detail about the politics and machinations behind the founding of the federation which happened as a direct result of the war ",preferred setting for the new section 31 show?

but primitive people can't conceive of technology that can make someone disappear or project a hundred foot jesus into the sky   so they are really easy to fool   it makes me wonder how many aliens with advanced tech were involved in creating the major religions   because that is what happened in that episode   they saw a time traveler with advanced tech and thought it was an angel   you can fool primitive people with parlor tricks like that   but you can't fool a technological civilization   even a primitive one   so how many aliens with advanced tech were involved in creating religion   just something to think about   honestly i'm surprised that in star trek the federation doesn't deal with more prime directive violations like that   someone could land on a primitive planet and pose as a god   i'm surprised it's not a common occurrence   anyway let me know what you think in the comments ",fooling primitive people with technology

2801,startrek,"with this post i just want to ask how other fans react to my unpopular opinions  

i'll try to keep it as spoilerfree as i can  except for lower decks, picard episode 3 onwards, short treks episode 6 onwards and voyager episode 26 onwards, because i haven't seen them yet and i can't spoil anything what i haven't seen, right?  

also, it could be that i've more, i just don't know if my opinion is controversal  and don't name every trek specific controversal opinion, because i have too much  (i'm easy to impress)

anyway let's start 

  the original series  

i think it's definetly controversal to say, that i really like the alternative factor  in my opinion it's a great story  implementing an entire universe, called the anti matter universe and we see some interesting dynamics between the trekverse (?) and this universe, what i really like 

also, most people think turnabout intruder is the worst tos episode  why? in my opinion it's the best of season 3 and also one of the best tos episodes  it has a great and unique idea, that the captain is no longer the captain, because he was    possessed (?) ok i don't know the word in english, because i'm not english, but hopefully you understand what i mean  and this allows also for a interesting dynamic between kirk (the ""ghost"" of him) and kirk (the woman in the body of kirk) 

and lastly city on the edge of forever is the worst episode ever (joke)

  the animated series  

idk if it's that controversal, but when i go by the imdb score there's definetly a difference  so i name the 2 episodes, but i wouldn't call them something special  i kinda enjoy bem and the magicks of megas tu  but i can't tell why  except for yesteryear, more tribbles more troubles, the series finale and the named episodes is this series awful, so i have nothing more to say 

  movies 1 6  

the only realy controversal opinion is that i think wrath of khan is just alright, because khan is annoying and feels like no threat at all  i think it's annoying that kirk being an admiral, and kirks son is also annoying, like project genesis ","unpopular opinions   how would other fans react to mine? part 1  tos, tas and the movies (1 6)"

2807,startrek,"aside from a couple of comments, first post in r startrek! 

just sharing something here because it's wholesome  me and my sister grew up together watching the very occasional episode (i was 8 and she was 6 when tng first aired in our country) aided by our mum, who was secretly a big ol' nerd and would insist that we kept trek on if we ran across it while channel hopping  i think my first memory of the show is the bit in the naked now when data is putting the chips back in the board super fast 

i started really paying attention in high school around ds9's later seasons, and for some reason my sis ended up watching a lot more tng than i did  as we grew into adults i mainly stuck to many of my nerdy pursuits, going on a more tech fuelled life trajectory and she broadened her horizons with travel, languages and teaching  but it always stayed as a running joke that any time she was stuck, she'd think ""what would captain picard do?"" (or ""what would snoop dogg do"" , but that's another story) 

we're super tight   best friends, and in lockdown, finally, i got her to give ds9 a try  this is after years of me going ""seriously, it's serialised, it's complex, nobody's purely good or evil, you'll love it  worf is in it!"" and her going ""i believe you, i'm sure it's great, but i love tng so much, it's what i grew up with, i'd feel like i was cheating on tng if i got into ds9""

well, one of the stations she watches started airing the whole run, and she's tried it  and she loves it  in her words ""i think i might be able to be    er    polytrekerous""  she's already latched onto father of the year benjamin sisko, and spotted how if something bad's gonna happen to someone, it's gonna happen to miles edward o'brien  her favourite characters are odo and quark (no change from the few episodes she saw as a little kid, then), and as of the writing of this post she's up to the past tense two parter

2809,startrek,"no seriously, next time you watch ds9, keep an eye on quark's mouth  all the ferengi do this open mouth thing, but armin is probably the best at it 

probably to show off the pointy teeth prosthetics (and to make them look a bit dim), ferengi almost always have their mouths open  the few times his mouth is closed it's usually in consternation  

the wide open but pointy smile fits so well with ferengi attitude, happy to please  but they're always ready to bite, at least your wallet  and try talking with your lips pressed over your gums like that  it's weird, i'm sure they must have practiced it a lot   

it gives them a genuinely alien demeanor in a way that's not over the top, i really like it a lot  also shoutouts to saru's ""supermodel walk"" which is great too  i imagine aliens would have all sorts of mild mannerism quirks like that, and little things we do would stand out as odd to them  ","quark's mouth is an example of unexpectedly great, in depth acting"

i'm confused ",something picard said re  sarek
2819,startrek,"i made a  post ( in october about how i was beginning tos again after a decade since i first watched 2 3rds of it  last night i completed the series and i am really stunned by the experience  having never finished the series as a kid, there was so much i hadn't seen before, and so much i hadn't remembered  there's a lot the criticize, but the show is easily one of the best i've ever seen  there's a magic to it that gives it so much staying power  

here's some quick and largely unoriginal thoughts 

  i watched it in production order and i feel it was definitely the right decision  it created a sense of continuity in watching the show develop in a linear way  there's a degree of character development that comes from the actors growing into their characters

  expanding on that,  i swapped the order of the last 2 episodes so that it ended with all our yesterdays  another good decision imo  it's a stunning episode and as kirk spock mccoy story it makes for a fitting ending

  kirk, spock, and mccoy are the heart of the show and their relationship is of its consistent strengths  it's less of an ensemble show than i remember  i've seen it mentioned before, but it wasn't something i noticed when i was younger

  spock is the best character  kirk is a great captain and isn't the womanizing swashbuckler he's portrayed as in pop culture and in the kelvin films

  season 3 isn't that bad  the budget cuts are obvious and you can tell that they ran out of money at the end there, but overall i loved most of it  when it's at its best, it has some of the series' highest moments  it's uneven and suffers more from being underdeveloped and underfunded than being outright bad  not to say it doesn't suck donkey balls sometimes  i was genuinely surprised overall

  favorite episode  the enterprise incident
   other favorites (in no order)  mirror, mirror, a piece of the action, the menagerie, all our yesterdays, journey to babel, metamorphasis, arena, where no man has gone before, dagger of the mind, i, mudd, a private little war, the savage curtain, the tholian web, 

  least favorites (again, no order)  the alternative factor, catspaw, the apple, the gamesters of triskellion, miri, tomorrow is yesterday, the paradise syndrome, let that be your last battlefield, whom gods destroy, the mark of gideon, turnabout intruder, the way to eden, that which survives, the omega glory

overall this was a truly amazing experience and i'm so excited to inevitably rewatch it a thousand more times  i'm beginning tas now, which i also saw about half of about a decade ago, so it'll be like watching it for the first time  i've heard good things about star trek continues so i might have to give it a watch too (as well as throw in some new voyages phase ii because it was really important to me as a kid)  then i'll be onto the movies which i've seen countless times and then onto tng, which i've seen maybe 25 episodes of, and then the other 6 ( ) shows  so i've got a lot ahead of me lmao  i'd say this has been a great decision",finished my first full watch of tos

2831,startrek,"i'm 100  supportive of more diversity in star trek in all forms, and think it just makes the show better  i am somewhat concerned though that this is just becoming a boxchecking exercise for the writers  in particular with adira, they've introduce the character, had the character say ""i'm non binary,"" and then seemed to have moved on (so far)  

can anyone who identifies as trans non binary provide some insight into whether they feel dsc s3 has is trying to capture the experience and or deal with it in a productive way? i personally am a straight, white, caucasian american male, and really have zero clue what it's like to be trans non binary (or indeed, if those are different things)  i was hoping for plots, subtext, convos that illustrate the subtleties of the experience issue, the way st has historically done with many (not all) social issues in a positive way ",non binary characters thoughts?

watching this episode for the first time just made me question how dumb worf and jadzia really are  worf has always been kind of the punching bag in tng as the dumb brute who always had his ideas shot down, but in ds9 he was suppose to be taken more seriously  but in change of heart, there was nothing more stupid than what had happened 

they're on their way to rendezvous with a cardassian spy  walking 20kms through dense jungle behind enemy lines 

jadzia gets shot about 7kms into the journey by some jem'hadar, and is steadily bleeding from her wound  instead of telling her to turn around and go back to the runabout to get rest and or treat herself, with worf venturing out to the rendezvous point on his own, he drags her with him for the next 13km trip  what was his plan here? have her go with him to get the spy, and then walk another 20kms back to the runabout? if the first 13km didn't kill her, the second 20kms definitely will  this is on top of both of them constantly having to delay and rest to tend to her wound  just the worst strategy ever 

i know this episode is suppose to demonstrate how deep their love is but all it demonstrated to me is how bad worf is at tactics and strategy   
at the end of the episode sisko tells worf he will probably never get his own command (even though he does command the defiant multiple times after this event) i completely agree that he should never be in charge of people ",what was worf's plan in s6e16 change of heart?

  the ni'var trust now starfleet or at last discovery to give them one of their sb 19 gate's

  let the discovery jump back to this station with her spore drive and deliver this gate

  the other side is at the mobile hq so they also receive one sb 19 gate 

  et voila! of course they first send only robot ships to starting fixing the station and do space wreaks cleanup to make it save for ships

  sb 19 travel route done

or other solution

  let discovery repair the needed subspace relays to get in contact with the station

  if they succeed in making contact they are not home yet 

  if communications and data link is established, they could try something out

  someone invent some sort of 3d printer with an data link trough this communication line

  yes, some sort of remote controlled 3d printer  

  discovery could deliver this platform as well and all they need to run it up

  they ""teleport"" the robot drones trough this solution  for humans this is still to risky

  they fix the station and do the cleanup until the mobile hq can visit it in real

sure, if they could right away teleport humans trough this, then they also could directly get the trans warp device out of the bin or even build an bigger one to teleport entire ships, no spore drive is needed  so since it is to early for this invention we need this ""ancient"" prototype here",idea for an discovery scene possible in season 4

  episode 39   ""terra firma, part 2""  

  mirror burnham admits there is a coalition forming to destroy the terran empire  this coup was explored during dis' first season  a rebellion was attempted a century earlier during the events of ""in a mirror darkly,"" and after georgiou's time the klingon cardassian alliance would finally succeed in bringing the empire down 
  among the races mirror burnham tattles on is the denobulans  this is the first direct reference to dr  phlox's race outside ent (there was a mention of denobulan bacteria in ld), although this is the mirror universe and they may be classified as a distinct species  the mirror denobulans were established in ""in a mirror darkly"" as a subservient race within the empire 
  the opening credits are vertically flipped and chromatically inverted, representing the episode's setting in the mirror universe  this is a nod to the ""mirror darkly"" arc in ent, whose mirror episodes featured a darker opening sequence 
  among the  iss discovery's  crew is mirror airiam (who was also seen last week but missed by me), as a full terran and not a cyborg  other than georgiou herself, the only other notable mirror character seen to be alive after her prime counterpart was killed is jennifer sisko (noting of course that this episode still takes place before prime airiam dies) 
  georgiou watches mirror burnham's agony session through a monitor enclosed in her wall  this is likely a tantalus field, a weapon that can remotely disappear anyone from a distance  mirror kirk possessed a tantalus field and ""mirror mirror"" implied that it was not a common tool within the empire 
  georgiou plants seeds of ""another way of doing things"" in mirror saru's ear  the same tactic was used by kirk to convince mirror spock to make a change in ""mirror, mirror "" that change, of course, eventually led to the empire's collapse 
  this is the first on screen appearance of the vacation hotspot risa in the nutrek era  unlike any of its other appearances, it is here depicted with rings 
  this episode carries on a mirror universe tradition of indiscriminately killing off alternate versions of major characters 
  other than the main headline, the rest of the content of carl's newspaper is the same as last week  items not previously logged by me include ""andorian famine contained"" (not a known reference) and the edition of the paper as ""vol  mmmclxxxviii,"" or 3188  notably the correct present day date should be 3189, as it took burnham a year to find  discovery  
  we learn that georgiou experienced three months within the span of a minute  a number of characters have done speedruns of dreams or hallucinations, perhaps the most famous being jean luc picard instantly serving a twenty year prison sentence in ""blink of an eye ""
  carl uses the phrase ""a mirror universe,"" the first canon use of that term 
  carl then goes ahead and reveals himself to be the guardian of forever, a temporal sentry introduced in ""city on the edge of forever,"" returning in ""yesteryear,"" and curiously not seen again before june 28, 2018  to this point the guardian was only known to exist on one unnamed planet in the alpha quadrant 
  the guardian's real voice is taken from ""city,"" and is that of bart larue, who provided a number of ""non corporeal being of the week"" voices during tos 
  book solves the technical dilemma using subspace relays, a common doohickey inserted wherever there are problems with subspace communications over long distances 
  georgiou is randomly thrown back in time in a transparent contrivance to set up her own spinoff  a similar device was used in another backdoor pilot, ""assignment  earth,"" where the  enterprise  just kinda showed up in the past so it could meet gary seven  a morally ambiguous character magically escaping the main story could also describe loki in  avengers  endgame  (loki himself is getting his own spinoff), and speaking of ""endgame,"" trek has an even longer history of using time travel for dubious narrative purposes ","canon references   ""terra firma, part 2""  spoilers "

 gt   
 gt the emperor is the smartest genius in the galaxy  there is no one smarter, and there never will be  therefore, whatever fate the emperor chooses, her choice will be correct, for herself and for the empire  and thus the emperor's reign will have ended, and the empire will mourn her loss

ds9 shows more of the screens to the audience than tng did  we see a lot more video and animations on the ds9 computers than we did on the tng ones  the result is that ds9 computers look have a 1990s look to them, but somehow, tng doesn't  this makes me wonder how the technology in shows like discovery will look 30 years from now 

i do not believe tos aged as well as tng in this respect, but considering how old that show is, i think it did remarkably well  my favorite example has to be the spock o scope  from a set design standpoint, it was a box with a blue light in it  but to the audience, it can display anything it needs to  a computer screen can't look dated if it's never actually shown to the audience ","star trek computers, and how dated they look now"

so why is this relevant? well we know that one seemingly young kelpien was on a ship at the center of the burn 125 years ago  if it were a vulcan the possibility that that individual is still alive is more then plausible  and this kelpien was a doctor! the ship is still working (or at least transmitting) after 125 years, suggesting something is maintaining it

everyone talks about how enterprise overly sexualizes t'pol but what the hell is happening in ds9 and dax? every episode so far has a throwaway line of how gorgeous and alluring jadzia is  if its not dr  bashir its quark and of course everyone assumes sisko must have had relations with her given their past

i'm conflicted, because many years ago i tried to get into it and after 2 or 3 episodes it didn't really stick  but, the same thing happened with ds(, and whe i tried again later i loved it

2926,startrek,"i am excited and honored to introduce 

my 2020 definitive ranking of every  star trek series   from worst to best!

before i begin, you may be asking, ""why?"" well, as it turns out, eliminating almost all social or external activity for about 9 months gives you an incredible amount of time to watch    literally every episode of star trek  plus, most of them were added to netflix this year, so that made it pretty easy to just hit play 

now, let's get to the list 

ranked from worst to best based on modern watchability 

8 enterprise (2001 2005)

7 the original series (1966 1969)

6 voyager (1995 2001)

5 discovery (2017   present)

4 the next generation (1987 1994)

3 picard (2020   present)

2 lower decks (2020   present)

1 deep space 9 (1993 1999)

i can hear you say, ""how dare you rank x series at y place!"" i will discuss each series in detail below, so you can review my reasoning  also, this is based on my opinion, and you can feel free to disagree in the comments 
you may also wonder if my opinions were biased by the order in which i watched the series, to which i say, sure, that's entirely possible  here's the order i watched them, starting in february and ending today  tng   ds9   voyager   picard   lower decks   tos  discovery was watched concurrently with several series, as it was released 

series comments 

deep space 9  ds9 might be the most non standard star trek that was ever released, and it quickly became my favorite  not only were the characters complex and well developed, the scripts were unique, the storylines were a nice combination of episodic and serialized, and its themes continue to hold up  it was heartbreaking, funny, exciting, thought provoking, and world building  it was just the best combination of everything you'd want from star trek  if you were to go watch one series, this is the one i recommend  

lower decks  the most recently debuted, and only the second animated series, lower decks might seem like an underdog for the top rankings, but for someone whose media consumption has been steeped in star trek, i was the exact target audience  literally every line of the script is dripping with reference and nostalgia, combined with some universally appreciable comedy  this isn't going to be for everyone, but it has been one that i have thoroughly appreciated 

picard  this is where the list starts to get tough, and i could absolutely see picard, tng, and discovery moving around in my ranking as more episodes are released  picard has only one season so far, but that season was one of the most well produced serialized seasons i've seen  it had a nice balance of nostalgia and new storylines  it continued the trend towards darker and more dramatic sets, and i hope future seasons continue the trend 

the next generation  i'll admit, this is the series that had the most nostalgia for me, though i was too young to have watched it while it aired  tng undoubtedly kicked off the second era of star trek, which was what i grew up on  to be honest, i had this ranked higher before i watched tos  i once read a criticism of tng that so many of its scripts were just re skinned tos scripts, and, unfortunately, that was pretty true  especially for the first 1 5 seasons, and for a large number of exploration related episodes  that being said, tng's uniqueness were in the episodes that were similar to deep space 9  tng's enterprise was a ship of diplomacy, as opposed to exploration, and contained families and more complex relationships, and that led to a much more well developed feel for the series 

discovery  tng and discovery are probably the closest between any two series on this list  they are both good, for different reasons  discovery is the first star trek series to make a full transition from an episodic to a serialized format, and while its first season may have had some isolated storylines, most of the show follows a single thread  the characters are great, and the story is pretty good, though the visuals definitely draw from the kelvin timeline star trek films (read  lens flares), which is not necessarily a bad thing  the 3rd season is currently airing, and it is certainly the best so far, though it also portrays a very different world, that is characterized by its scarcity  ultimately, i think it's very possible that the series will rise above tng, but i think only time will tell 

voyager  this show suffered from living in the shadow of tng  unfortunately, i think the transition from the plentiful federation of tng to the stark shortage of resources in voyager just felt too different  the series was good, and some of its characters stand out as star trek all stars, and janeway is probably the most under rated captain  it's stories weren't particularly unique, for the most part, and most of the show suffered from the largest downside of tng, rehashing old themes 

the original series  for some, this will be the most controversial part of my list  i can hear it already, ""it was good for it's time "" here's the problem  this isn't the 1960's anymore  in one sentence, it was sexist, campy, tired, on the nose, groundbreaking, and did i mention sexist? listen, i watched every  star trek series that's ever been made, and i made this list based on which series i think people should watch today, not by time traveling back to when the show first aired  it doesn't hold up as well as many wish it did, and most of the ""best"" tos wasn't actually in the 3 seasons that aired, but in the films, which i am not including in my rankings    

enterprise  most of the people that say they liked this series, are confusing it, because of its name, with tos  coming out of tng, ds9, and voyager, it was just    disappointing  there's a lot that went wrong here, but i think the influence of 9 11 on american culture and television stands out  it took a 180 degree turn on portraying a future without prejudice (in fact most of the main characters are prejudiced in one form or another), and its theme song sucked  yes, i'm going to lay at least some of the blame on the theme  just listen to it, it's just bad 
 
so there you go, 757 episodes of star trek later, i hope you enjoyed the fruits of my ""labors"" over the past 9 months of quarantine  instead of learning mandarin, picking up the guitar, or reading more books, i watched all of star trek, and with that burden of knowledge, i bestow up on you, 

my 2020 definitive ranking of every  star trek series   from worst to best!

 excluding star trek  the animated series  feel free to make a case for why i should have watched it below, but i have yet to hear one 
  films and movies are a subject for another list  i think the procuction budgets, format, and timing constraints make films significantly different from content developed for a tv series  also, they weren't on netflix 
   it's important to know that a significant number of episodes were consumed in an almost podcast like format while i went on solitary walks to get out of the house during quarantine  this turned out not to have been as much of a hindrance, especially for the older series, considering the amount of reused sets and visuals ",a quarantine obsession becomes the 2020 definitive star trek series ranking
2927,startrek,"so i m rewatching tng  one episode is like we need to intercept them asap  set course warp 5  why aren t they going warp 9?

come to think of it, why would they even travel below warp 9?",why don t they always travel at warp 8 or 9
2928,startrek,"    its been a long road, getting from there to here!

seriously, this show is severely underrated  i enjoy the sense that they are real pioneers, exploring the true unknown 

i am halfway through the first season and really enjoying it  

looking forward to the rest of the series  and yes, i know about the finale   ","lifelong trekkie, watching ent for the very first time, and i have to say   "
2929,startrek,"when it became clear that this pandemic was going to last a long time, i ordered a face mask from an etsy seller  it was designed to look like a tng uniform  mostly blue, black border on the top, comm badge insignia over the left side of my jaw, and two rank pips over the right side  i've worn it since may  i figure, if i have to wear a mask, i may as well have fun with it 

in that time, nobody has said anything about it except my wife  until yesterday 

i was walking through the bread aisle at the grocery store  a man about my age and his daughter (age 11, i would guess) were approaching opposite me  suddenly, he grinned and said, ""hey, check out this guy's mask!"" his daughter smiled and kind of gasped  i could tell they were both fans of the show 

then he quizzed her  ""what's his rank?""

""lieutenant?"" she guessed 

""right on,"" i answered  and we went our separate ways 

that simple but pleasant interaction gave me a big boost for the rest of the evening  i just wanted to share ",someone finally acknowledged my tng uniform face mask!
2930,startrek,i am shocked how much i love this show  it's ahead of tos and voyager for me  i'm at the beginning of season 2 but i can't get over how great it is  it has its faults but damn its good  and yes   i have learned to love the theme song ha!,i really really like enterprise
2931,startrek,"i'm watching star trek 3, the search for spock, and i came to realize that they could just flip the ship 90 degrees and get out of space dock more quickly because the ship would be narrower along the x axis    theres no inherent reason why the ""top"" of the ship needs to be parallel to the galactic plane   the people inside wouldnt know the difference ",wouldntbit make sense to flip federation ships 90  so they're narrower relative to the galactic plane?

2936,startrek,"is there an actual reason i'm supposed to feel bad that kila marr killed the crystalline entity? i feel like i missed something 

like we know of two occasions in which lore communicated with it, and coordinated with it(via lowering shields) in order to kill large groups of people   the way i look at it, it knew what it was doing  had the enterprise let the entity live, it would have gone on to kill more 

the ""whale krill"" metaphor doesnt seem to apply here   a whale isn't that intelligent and just feeds, whereas the crystalline entity completely knows what it's doing, otherwise lore couldn't have conversations with it  if it had a conscience it likely would have found another food source, either that or it clearly wasn't able to survive by any other source 

in which case if the latter was true, the crystalline entity would have to be killed anyway ",crystalline entity rant

2941,startrek,"i always felt they sold chakotay short (and tom and harry were pretty much interchangeable in any scene, with b'elanna not too far behind), but it always feels like the writers just copied and pasted from some master document the interaction between chakotay and b'elanna, who should have a much bigger and deeper backstory 

chakotay  i want you to get along with xx person, or perform this action 

b'elanna  i can't do that because i'm too angry

chakotay  that's an order

for the rich characters of janeway, seven, and tuvok, it always felt like the writers had no idea what to do with any of the others, and interactions like these just feel like they're repeated throughout the series ",rewatching voyager and i am continually surprised at the b'elanna and chakotay interactions
2942,startrek,"why is he suddenly replaced by captain kirk, or was it the opposite? 

if i'm going to learn why this happened in the show, just let me know and don't bother telling me ","i just watched the 2 first episodes of star trek (1966), and i don't quite get what happens to captain pike?"
2943,startrek,"i'm finishing my first rewatch of ds9 in many years  since the first time i saw it it became my favorite piece of st by a mile  one of the best elements of the long story arcs that ds9 develops (in contrast to the episodic nature of other st shows) is how it can take a minor character and make him relevant 

damar was gul dukat's right hand man when dukat had been demoted and was serving as captain of a single ship  he was barely a named character  but he was there  

when dukat takes control of cardassia allying with the dominion damar remains as his faithful ally and right hand man  he's marked by his loyalty to dukat, the man that brought him up through the ranks  damar is a proud cardassian and prone to drinking, but he does his duty to dukat with great dilligence 

we see the first real development of this character when dukat orders him to ""befriend"" his daughter, and we see how damar is at a complete loss when dealing with civilians in any kind fashion  he's used to giving orders as a soldier, not being polite  he tries to convince her that her father is a great man, but she won't listen to him  later when he finds out that ziel betrayed the cardassians he kills her, and struggles to get dukat out of the station in vain  

with dukat gone damar, this character that started out as almost irrelevant is now the puppet leader of the cardassian union  the weight of the murder, the lost of his mentor, and the responsabilities of guiding an entire country through a brutal struggle that is killing millions of cardassians takes its tool on damar  he starts to drink, and his continuous loss of power within the dominion only exacerbates the situation  he's now a shadow of his former self  

when the dominion allies with the breen damar finally realizes that the cardassians have lost favor completely, and that they are now themselves a subjugated people, much like they had once enslaved bajor  throughout the last arc of the series, damar is a main character, betraying the dominion and fighting for cardassian liberation 

the relationship between dukat and damar is also very interesting  he seems to have been the only truly genuine friend of dukat, and both cared for each other, even when dukat was already in full evil prophet mode  damar probably saw dukat as his mentor, and dukat saw in damar the respect that he so desperately craved from everyone else  

tl dr    ds9 took a side character that was barely worth a name and (through 5 seasons) made him into a conflicted and loyal soldier thrust into power, devoured by depression that turned him to drinking before finally redeeming himself in a way ",i love how they developed the character of damar in ds9

2945,startrek,"my road to star trek fandom was (i think) a bit unusual and yet it has greatly influenced my life  

the main reason my road to star trek was a bit odd was that it was 2013 and i was a 15 year old chinese girl  not the target demographic of star trek nor the right time frame 
my brother was watching star trek (2009) on tv and tbh i thought it looked a bit rubbish  rather than sitting through the film, i half listened and wikipedia ed the synopsis  this led me down the star trek rabbit hole    i was surprised how long it had been running for and how many incarnations there were  i then went on youtube and found  the picard video ( i loved it  i had no idea who the characters were but i kept listening  i eventually took the plunge and watched tng what a great first episode! i was hooked  hooked enough to get through the rather dubious season 1 

after that, i watched every incarnation, read loads of books, wrote a few terrible fanfictions, and chose to study physics at university  star trek not only kindled my love of science, but also shakespeare and humanity

i'm about to dive into star trek for the first time   all of star trek, right from the original series  up until now, i've only ever seen odd scenes or the very occasional tng episode that my parents might have had on in the background  the idea of star trek has always sounded super appealing to me though  i love me some sci fi, world building, philosophy and ethics   


i also run a youtube channel, and wondered if there was an opportunity there to record something interesting from the perspective of someone who is diving into star trek for the first time  that's what i'm here to ask   as a star trek buff, someone who knows and loves the shows, what would you find interesting to hear from someone coming in with fresh eyes (if anything?)  


i could come at this from a few different angles  something more akin to a straightforward review of each episode and what i thought of it  it could be something more directly philosophical where i discuss my thoughts or solutions on the presented dilemma (for applicable episodes, i realise that's not all of what star trek is)  it could even be something a little gamified puzzle solving, where i try to draw out a map of the ship galaxy historical timeline as accurately as possible (i have no idea how feasible that is)  that's not an exhaustive list, and i come to the subreddit since someone who has seen trek might be able to think of things i'd simply have no idea about    


i guess i'll also finish with a broader question  if you could forget everything about star trek and go back and watch it all again like it was the very first time, is there anything  you'd  like to do with that opportunity?

2977,startrek,"i'm aware that writers came up with one big explanation that got something to do with picard's knowledge about ""theta band carrier waves"", but still, it's a weak excuse to send one of the best federation captains on a mission like this  if you want your team to successfully complete a stealth mission or at least to have higher chances, you need some kind of badass spy, who has experience in operations like that  not a bald diplomatic starship captain who long passed his physical prime  

from a screenwriting standpoint, it's the weakest part of the story in my opinion  however, from the inside perspective (inside star trek universe), it comes off like a setup to get rid of picard by someone on the federation side  mostly, because of a scene at the beginning, when it was established that picard didn't have much of a choice  this is kinda suspicious 

by the way, some people think that riker was kinda an asshole in this episode, and yes he was to a degree, but i can understand why  it ain't easy to keep your composure when you work with a guy like captain jellico  he proved himself as a great captain, but his blunt taskmaster approach can really mess with the crew's morale

2980,startrek,"from all the little things that bother me with trek (how pop references are restricted to humanity, the federation is basically the us, language is never a barrier), the thing that gets me thinking the most is how the holosuite is basically a god machine 

forget the technical details that one of those machines is capable of creating vast simulated spaces packed with people in such a life like manner that would utterly baffle any computer scientist  each of these holosuites is a supercomputer that likely has a software and hardware more powerful than every piece of machinery in nasa combined  and quark has 3 of those! 

what really gets me thinking is how the characters in these holosuites are basically alive! they are so perfectly simulated, with so much memory and programing going into each character, that they utterly believe they are real people? and i ask you, if you are indistinguishable from a real human, and truly believe you are a real human?   what is the difference?   they believe they feel emotion, so what's the difference between that and actually feeling it? isn't the human brain just tricked by a series of impulses and substances much in the same manner? 

and then we get to more complicated characters, such as   the doctor and vic fontaine    they are sentient! what the hell is the difference by that point? they are fully living organisms that feel emotions, have memories, and ponder their very existence  

if data can be regarded as an individual, than so should they  if anything, a sentient character of a holosuite is far more of an individual than data, as they are capable of experiencing things data cannot, such as emotion 

so basically, everytime you turn on the holosuite, you are god playing with innocent lives ",holosuites basically create life 
2981,startrek,"one of the things in star trek that annoys me is that starfleet has way too many rigid and ridiculous rules   it's become and ineffectual bureaucracy   it makes it difficult for the crew of a starship to actually make a difference   the prime directive is one rule that annoys me   there should be exceptions to the prime directive to be able to interfere to prevent planetary disasters, etc   interfering for personal gain or for the benifit of the federation should be prohibited   then you have the temporal accord   the rules against time travel   usually not using time travel is a good idea   but there are exceptions to every rule   the temporal accord didn't exist in star trek four but if it had and kirk had followed it earth would have been wiped out   

so interference should be judged on a case by case basis as to whether or not it's justified   having rules that say you can't do something no matter the situation is just not practical   that is one thing i like about the original series   and i don't like the original series   but they weren't bogged down in rules and regulations as much   so they were able to get more done   eventually starfleet is going to have so many rules that it will become a totally ineffective organization   so they need to rethink a lot of these insane rules and get rid of most of them and rewrite the ones that are left so that they make practical sense   so let me know what you think in the comments ",starfleet has too many rigid and ridiculous rules

since we know what effects trellium d had on t pol, couldn t we infer that this could have had something to do with her initial attraction to trip? this would have been her first exposure to the compound, and would have had no idea how it would affect her  perhaps there was a very slight degradation of her neural pathways just being in its presence, and then began to associate that sensation with being near trip

it's also just really great for stamet's growth as a character  tilly was looking up to him as a mentor in the first two seasons and while they had their moments she ended up finding better mentors in michael and saru  paul was just too cold and wasn't able to really warm to her when she needed him to  but adira is an actual teenager and that's clearly got stamets way outside his comfort zone, which is when anthony rapp really shines as an actor  i don't know if the instagram posts are canon, but the idea in this one   that stamets is trying to be a better ""dad"" to adira than his dad was to him just really hits home with me

overrated  the carbomite maneuver 

i don't get the appeal  it was much too slow and boring 

underrated  the squire of gothos

(it's so great  a predecessor of q and i like the twist at the end  maybe this ep is well liked, but i didn't find it in any best of lists)

(i've only seen the first 20 episodes and the pilot of tos)

tng

overrated  

data's day  (it doesn't bring anything new to data's character and i don't like how it portrays keiko)

who watches the watchers  i really don't think picard arguments why it's wrong to interfere hold up at all  there are people (troi and riker) at risk and he already has (even involuntaryly) greatly influenced these people  they're thinking of him as a god  

picard clinging to a dogma instead of thinking something through case for case is the reason why he's rated so low on my best captain list 

any q episode (this includes tapestry)  q is maybe my least favourite character in the whole trek verse

underrated  

the high ground

premptive strike

in both episodes the conflicts aren't portrayed as black and white, something that is unfortunately often the case with tng

rightful heir  this episode is really neat

 amp  x200b 

ds9 

overrated  this is hard, because all episodes that are generally hold in greatest esteem are all really that good, so i'll nominate all mirror universe episodes, because i just really hate the mirror universe concept

underrated    nor the battle to the strong

i don't think it isn't well liked, but i think it deserves to be under the top 10 ds9 episodes  dealing with similiar themes, it left a bigger impact on me than ""the siege of ar 588""

 amp  x200b 

voy 

overrated  tinker, tenor, doctor, spy

i'm baffled that this epsiode is on so many top episodes list  i think it isn't really fun and it isn't endearing  the doctor dreaming that every female main cast member is into him gets old veeery fast  don't get me wrong, you can make this joke once, maybe twice, but there are multiple scenes with it, so it feels excessive  it's an episode that i feel like skipping  i just can't stand it  i prefer fair haven and maybe even spirit folk to it and i loooathe these episodes 

 amp  x200b 

underrated  

  prototype, i don't know if my nostalgia is blinding me, (prototype was one of the first episodes of star trek that i watched) but this episode holds up every time i watch it  it is one of the best engineer centric episodes in the whole of star trek 

but i generally loove b'elanna centric episodes, she's my favourite character and she isn't well liked in the fandom

but seriously guys  prototype, dreadnought, revulsion and juggernaut are just great episodes 

i also really like the thaw(the one with fear personified as a clown played by michael mckean  but i don't think the thaw is a underrated episode, it's a polarizing episodes, people hate it or love it

and holy shit, ds9 is an amazing show, i've been reluctant to watch it for whatever reason, but i'm so glad i finally do, the characters have really gown on me already and it might be the only trek show with a great first season  the way it portrays issues still very real in our own society is great and thought provoking, in no way does it feel like they're lecturing me (like disco likes to do) and any conclusions you come to, you come to on your own

first why do they have to put the two lbgtq  people together? this doesn't bother me a lot, but it does feel very contrived and silly  stamet's experience as a gay man in the 23rd century has nothing to do with a non binary character in the 32nd century  ok in universe it's kind of because of adira's fascination with the spore drive, but then why do they never seem to do anything except talk about their emotions and confusion  goodness me, get some freaking star trek in there with the melo drama please  

secondly why did he volunteer her as able to write the algorithm  if he knows she can and is trying to get her to step up why doesn't he tell her to say this? it felt like that whole scene was just a set up for the later they them pronouns discussion  on that not why was adira scared to tell anyone about it before stamets? do you mean to tell me that in 1,200 years we haven't made enough progress on the trans acceptance movement on earth that it's even more taboo than now? what ever happened to the argument they have made in the past about doing this  in the future people don't care that picard is bald or about interracial kisses  this is doing the exact opposite of that  i get that it's supposed to kind of be a dystopian future rather than the utopia of the 23rd and 24th centuries, but if this is the case you need to at least hint at some reason why we might have slid backwards, maybe some new religious movement or an under population crisis after the burn  but this is a dying society, not a reborn society  also she always felt this way but didn't feel ok telling anyone? really? not even their trans boyfriend?

then to get away from the woke aspect of it entirely, right after this conversation they are suddenly in a music room together  stamet's is on the piano adira on cello, then after she plays he says ""i didn't know you played cello""  then why did you guys go to the music room together? you didn't question this when she got up and walked to the music room and you sat on the piano to accompany her? really? not when she picked up the cello, rosined up her bow and got ready to play?

look star trek has and hopefully always will be a perfect medium to push progressive ideas  it's the future where our petty issues of today are presumably resolved  but this is just such a 180 on how the have successfully handled these issues before  it feels like they are trying to create a bigger issue rather than try to address them here  it feels like they have gotten extremely lazy with stamets character, especially contrasted to cubler who has become an important character who happens to be gay instead of a character who is basically only important because he is gay and a few other things from the first episode ", rant  frustrations with dsc regarding adira and stamets  s3e8 minor spoilers

regardless, we've had iterations of trek over the last decade that take place in three distinct universes at various times  in the most recent episode of discovery (terra firma part i) we learn of a character named yor who travelled from the kelvin verse to the prime 

the kelvin universe as a free standing universe or dimension has now been confirmed    there's also a much deeper exploration of the mu than we've previously had 

is discovery possibly setting up a major crossover event or introducing the concept of a star trek 'multiverse' akin to dc?",is star trek heading to a crisis of infinite earths event? (possible spoilers)
3028,startrek,,author ensley f  guffey introduces homebrew rule andorian ice sculpture
3029,startrek,"this is basically just gonna be a place for me to dump random stuff about the series that's on my mind atm 

seeing the somewhat polarized reaction to discovery has been a strange experience  i've come out of every season of the show impressed  and i think there are a few discovery episodes that rival even the best episodes of tng  that being the sound of thunder and unification iii 

is it as good as tng? absolutely not  it was never going to be  as unfortunate as it might be for us  i don't believe that a 90s era style of trek show could ever work in the modern entertainment climate  i've always seen discovery as an attempt to create a show which was capable of becoming popular today while also being true to the series' origins  i can only imagine how difficult this must be to do  when you do something like that, you're always going to piss people off  everyone has their own version of what star trek is ""about"" or what it means, so its kind of impossible to please even the majority of the community  and even on a more objective level, this kind of transition will always leave some unfortunate artifacts in the show  i see the admittedly very messy tangle of plot lines that plague the first two seasons of evidence of that 

i also find the reaction to several of the series' more political choices to be somewhat    perplexing  i know its been said before, but star trek is and always has been a progressive franchise  first interracial kiss, first same sex kiss  why anyone was upset about star trek continuing to be that way with the gay couple and now the non binary character is beyond me, and makes me question why they're watching the series in the first place  the stock response i hear to that is ""oh well they didn't push it in our faces back then "" honestly, i don't know what you're talking about  i don't really see much of a difference between the way that previous series handled their more progressive areas  

they barely even acknowledge that there's a same sex couple in the show  there wasn't some big reveal there, there just was a gay couple and that was that  the non binary scene was literally  ""i feel like more of a they then a she"" ""oh okay i'll call you they then""  contrast that to the anti capitalist speech that picard goes on during first contact  if a single scene of someone asking for their pronouns to be respected is pushing it in our faces, but picard literally going on a speech about how much better the future is because we got rid of capitalism is not  then i just don't understand what the problem is  

in conclusion    fandoms confuse me  i often find the very critical and emotional nature of reactions to recent entries in many franchises to be annoying, and pretty unwarranted  it really just seems like certain people are trying to find things to be angry about  that doesn't mean there isn't room for constructive criticism, but this kind of criticism seems pretty emotional and baseless  although i do have a tendency to find things to enjoy in most of the entertainment i consume, so maybe i'm just particularly optimistic and minimizing flaws in my head ",some thoughts on modern trek

3037,startrek,"so i'm a massive tng fan and i have enjoyed disco by and large until 2 things dawned on me as to why my interest is waning this season  

1  they are not fleshing out the bridge crew at all  i don't really know any names or arcs with the exception of detmer and frankly not enough of her  i would prefer some episodes based around these characters to open up the show and kinda drop the michael burn centred story for a bit so i can get to know the rest of the crew 

2  where are all the lead men? i support inclusion and representation of strong women, different races and species, lgtb and gender fluidity but season 3 seems lob sided and i personally don't feel drawn to any male member and i miss that  book seems jammed in only for michael's sake, saru is still very soft for a captain (and not human), the admiral is just a dick so the only 2 left are colber and stamets but they don't get enough screen time either 

i wonder if i'm being a snowflake here but i would like to see a more balanced show and have another pike or lorca type emerge as i think they are really being missed this season

3040,startrek,"so i knew some of the plot points coming in because of following this sub, namely that there was a klingon spy who had infiltrated discovery and that the captain was secretly from the mirror universe   i also knew a lot of people had negative opinions of the show early on so i was wary 

in the first few episodes i was intrigued but i didn t really like any of the characters save for maybe captain georgiou (note i m gonna refer to prime georgiou as captain georgiou and mirror as emperor georgiou)   i think the emperor did give a good critique of burnham in one of the later episodes  you don t follow through    i found michael unbearable in the first few episodes   they were headstrong, know it all, but then mopey and hateful   they were almost the worst combination of human and vulcan you could think of   intelligent and logical but their emotions took over enough to shoot their fucking captain?!  and then their emotions took over enough to be depressed about and push everyone around them away   seemingly it was intended from the beginning that michael would open up more to their crew mates, and their own humanity and learn what it means to be human   so over time i grew to like michael 

a writing problem i had with some of the characters was that they pivoted too quickly   besides the security officer that they offer early on   like lorca was every bit a terran imperial officer at first but he softens rather quickly and seemingly with no real rhyme or reason, then once in the mirror universe he immediately pivots back to mustache twirlingly evil   this frustrates me bacause i had started to like lorca   i thought when he mentioned that he had attempted a coup against the emperor that he meant like he was trying to make positive changes in the empire   nope!  he s even more of a xenophobe than the emperor who genocided the klingons and ate kelpian for dinner?!  he was a misogynist and groomed mirror burnham into a sexual relationship to get to the emperor?!  dude s just a creep   there is a small part of me that hopes to see prime lorca at some point and that the admiral is wrong about his inability to survive the mirror universe 

  saru is seems to have gone from a minor role to a much more pivotal one fairly quickly   his initial mistrust of burnham seems to be only partially founded, then it s like he suddenly is cool with her again like a light switch   as the season progresses i grow to really like saru though, to the point that he s probably my favorite character 

i m not going to say too much else but i liked ash tyler s and michael burnham s relationship   i thought they wrapped it up pretty well with their last scene together before landing on the klingon home world   though i feel like it must have been devistating to michael for tyler to go with l rell

there is a taller third bottle though with a green top on one of the bottles   now it could be tabasco green, but i think that's a wrong guess   the bottles are standardized on all of the tables, so why would anyone always buy the original size of one tabasco but the larger size of the other?  if we factor out tabasco green, then what hot sauce could it be?    


please keep in mind that a restaurant would probably buy hot sauces by the case, so a boutique (rare) hot sauce that you might find in a hot sauce store just isn't likely   in terms of balance given the other two heats  flavors  consistencies, it could be a sriracha sauce    but i just don't recognize the brand   also, given how sisko sr loves to cook with items from earth, let's factor out an off world 24th century brand

i don't want to call the actors wooden, but they're definitely very proper  they speak very clearly, their accents impeccable and there's pretty much no slang as far as i've gotten  and the ship is just incredibly clean, the sets are very well put together but they don't really feel lived in  there's no wear and tear anywhere  and i get that the whole aesthetic of the franchise is supposed to be very pristine, but it just ends up feeling off to me  like the world isn't lived in, and really it's just a theme park populated by puppets being paraded around before me under the pretence of humanity (or whatever race they may be)  hell, if anything data feels like the most realistic character to me because he doesn't try and be human in the slightest, he's just very clearly robotic and there's no expectation of humanity   


i'm really sorry if this is coming off as harsh or anything, i'm finding it hard to describe this odd feeling to others  is this something anyone else has experienced, and does it get better as it goes or should i just watch ds9 instead as that seems to be more recommended (at least by the people i know)",tng uncanny valley?

live long and watch a lot of star trek! i have just spent the last 2 years developing the ultimate spreadsheet for trekkies  i built it out of love for everything star trek and can't live without it  basically it is an excel spreadsheet that tracks everything star trek 

  the website link attached is to my spreadsheet compiled in xlspadlock, that i have been building for the last few years that acts as a detailed personal database of everything we have ever watched in the entire star trek franchise    

the database is currently up to date and includes lower decks, picard series 1 and provision for series 2 and discovery 1 3 with already provision for season 4 because it has been announced  and all the short treks are included as well as all the episodes of after trek for discovery series 1 and the ready room with will wheaton for picard, discovery series 3 and the beginning, middle and end of the first series of lower decks 

all of the titles in the database are all hyper linked to memory alpha as well so you can check up on the details before or after you record the details about the show you just watched  including if it is a favourite, how many times you watched it and any notes or comments you want to make 

and i have created something called my treks  this is a shareable database built into the application  so as a fan finds something new and interesting for star trek they just add it to the database and on a monthly basis i intend to push out an update with everyone's contributions  the beauty of this spreadsheet is that updated compiles easily restore your existing personal database which is automatically saved and stored separately every time you close the application

3166,startrek,"i haven't watched a lot of tos before this, but after the latest discovery episode i went out of my way to watch city on the edge of forever   after i finished watching it, it just struck me that it's great that new trek content is making me go back and watch older trek that i haven't seen before   i'm sort of more tempted to watch the whole series now too 

i quite liked the episode and given how long these episodes are   and the setting, it felt more like an old movie   for a fully honest review, i'd have to say that the setup in the first 5 or so minutes of the episode felt a bit clunky    but a mad mccoy running around terrorizing the locals made up for it 

kirk's dilemma was fun to watch unfold, spock had a lot of great lines, and the whole plot of the episode was well put together, but i found the machine spock built just showing them exactly what they needed to see a bit convenient    although i admit i might have missed something in the dialogue 

the ending was great, with kirk not even responding to the guardian and after a brief pause just saying  ""let's get the hell out of here"", and then they just leave    oh yeah, and edith keeler was a hottie, i would have had a big dilemma on my hands in kirk's situation too

3167,startrek,"disclaimer  if you like this episode great! i respect that completely  i didn t and want to vent  

i just finished it and i don t think an episode has irritated me this much in a while  this has to be one of the stupidest trek episodes ever  everyone just has the idiot ball throughout (except seven, tuvok, and torres)  janeway really put the life of her digital boyfriend over the lives of the doctor, kim, and paris instead of shutting down the damn program! and then the episode has the audacity to make that bs sympathetic? 

can we talk about the unfortunate implications in this and the first fair haven ep? janeway got rid of micheal s digital wife, destroyed all memory of her, and fully reprogrammed him because she viewed him as fictional and not real (like most holodeck characters)  then in this ep she s treating him and the other fh characters as more important than her crew despite them being able to be fixed (like paris did between episodes)  also the fact any holodeck character can be taken out of the program via the holo emitter (which really should only work for the doctor) and given sentience through a malfunction (at least in tng when moriarity became sentient there was a better described reason)  

the entire thing not only seems stupid, but is really uncomfortable the more you think about it (especially in the light of what other flesh characters have done to holodeck characters in this franchise  you re telling me they were all capable of sentience with the right computer problems?)  i mean even just between these two voy eps it s frightening because janeway killed the dude s wife and wiped everyone s memories  wasn t she sentient too then? 

the doctor is supposed to be a special case and i love that, but these episodes cheapen the concept and don t even do it right due to contradictions  just    awful episodes in my opinion ",voyager s  spirit folk  rant
3168,startrek,"when i learned that the romulan ""prophecy"" in pic was that there were sentient machines bent on removing biological life, i assumed that there was a twist incoming, where they could reason with the machines or otherwise negotiate with them  it would be a nice trek y story to find some way of working to communicate with and understand these mechanical life forms so far  from ourselves 

instead, the romulan xenophobia was essentially justified, because there were evil robots willing to exterminate biological life  what's the point of having a story where the moral is ""yes the bad guys were justified in their crusade against artificial life, but it doesn't matter because we stopped the apocalypse in the nick of time""? why not have a story where the romulans jumped to conclusions and unnecessarily deployed violence against innocents, when instead a good faith attempt at communication would have worked?

i think the reason this especially annoyed me was that following dis season 2, which gave us two seasons in a row with a senient ai enemy, both of which were both pretty cliche, and star trek had already perfected with its borg stories ",the weirdest choice star trek  picard made was having the evil romulan cult be essentially correct about everything

my approach would be to essentially make the tkon empire   the galactic empire

like star trek iv for example   after they time travel back from earth with humpback whales, they created a new timeline where earth survives the probe and humpback whales are no longer extinct

3210,startrek,"i grew up on tng (and the rest of star trek too) and i love patrick stewart and i cannot for the life of me enjoy this show  it's mediocre television at best and absolutely terrible as star trek 

for example there was a scene where picard was repulsed by the former borg on the artifact because of his assimilation ptsd  but after seeing how hugh was helping them reclaim their lives it helped him work through some things and see the former borg as victims like him instead of monsters  overcoming prejudice in space is a classic pillar of star trek and i was glad to see this in here  unfortunately, it was a 20 second throwaway scene and the former borg are never shows as anything but mindless zombies for the rest of the season  that scene could have been expanded to an entire episode of tng and it probably would have been one of the best if it were 

then we have 7 of 9 grappling with the idea of taking over all the drones on the artifact to fight the romulans and ultimately save all their lives  ends vs  means in space, another pillar of good star trek  but again this idea is explored for about 10 seconds and then discarded and never really returned to  it's a convenient bit of deus ex machina disguised as a theme 

there were a lot of little scenes too which bothered me in a star trek context  it just did not depict a future i could be hopeful for and that's probably the most important characteristic of star trek

and for my last example of why it's bad star trek, there is the part where one of the androids does a mind meld with agnes to try and clarify what her vision meant  maybe they were wrong about the message? maybe the advanced synthetics are peaceful and it was the fear of the unknown that caused the romulans to think they are destroyers  nope  same message, just stated more clearly this time  this could have been the most star trek part of the series if it was done differently 

and even if it was the same story in a different, not star trek, show it still wasn't great  the main plot was a bad mass effect rip off and the ship was extremely boring (i don't even remember its name and i finished the show last night!)  i liked some of the characters (rios and his holograms for example)  but others were pretty bad  the guy with the sword for example  you could remove all his lines and replace him with a dog and it would not change a thing about the rest of the show  another bit of deus ex machina disguised as a character this time  hugh was well done but under used  there could have been some really interesting plotlines about him exploring what it means to survive being assimilated

imagine my excitement at learning a contemporary big budget star trek series was in the works  man i couldn't wait  i had this feeling that trek could rival the mcu or game of thrones in terms of marketability and outright mania  the diversity of stories and adventures available within the trek universe is staggering  then i heard bryan fuller was on board  wow  an actual genuine tv talent  someone who understands budget, visual and story telling appeal     nicolas myer?! holy shit  then word of an anthology series     different crew, different setting each season! yeeesssssss! hook it to my veins!


then fuller left  then alex kurtzman came aboard     ok ok     it could still be good, right? then, news that the anthology idea had been jettisoned, this would be a prequel  oh no  oh lord no  i had zero faith in kurtzman respecting canon  i was right  

i watch discovery  i will continue to watch discovery  but i'm not a fan  i watch because it's trek  but in so many ways it let's itself down  and i'm getting tired of coming onto trek forums and looking to engage in a reasonable discussion about discovery without it's defenders acting like spoiled children or explaining plot holes using their own head canon  

we're fans  we've invested hundreds of hours in this franchise, it's universe and it's characters  we're allowed be miffed when somone produces a serious that is totally disrespectful of that franchise  

i know people harp on about this   but yes, michael's crying  it's absolutely ridiculous  for comparison  imagine laforge shedding a tear when dressed down by picard  or bones  or odo weeping because sisko said he didn't trust him  remember ds9? remember how all the characters felt like they cared and loved one another without saying it in every episode? or hugging? starfleet is a para military organisation  these people are soldiers and explorers  they know how to comport themselves in front of their superiors  

her continued insubordination and her crew's tolerance of same is ludicrous  
the mycilical network is farcical  roller coaster turbo lifts  the set design of discovery is lazy as fuck man  glowing corridors  awesome  the mirror universe is a cheap, played out concept  enough  give us something new man  we're in the 31st century now man  new races    new empires    new tech     give me new ideas, new worlds, new species, new sci fiction spins, show me a q joining star fleet, let's see what lies outside the milky way    let's deal with black holes    strange new phenomena     i don't wanna see fucking tilly with a new hair do acting evulz  

i could go on and on ranting about my feelings on discovery  but largely i feel disappointed  let down     they had a perfect opportunity here to move forward, a post nemisis and post kelvin incursion timeline  25th century  new ship  new crew  and they wasted it  so now we have picard instead     
best not get me started there! 

look   in short  i love trek  even when i hate it  i'm glad there's trek on tv  but discovery is such a wasted opportunity      it could have been so amazing  but instead i guess i'll tune it to hear about how micheal burnham is the only person capable of saving the universe for the 33rd time in a row, then watch her cry for a bit

so they should have gone back in time and stopped the burn   to not do so when they can is a crime   even if doing so breaks some ridiculous rules   doing the right thing should be more important then rules and regulations   that's why starship captains often break the prime directive to help less advanced civilizations   it may not be following the rules but it is the right thing to do   so they should have used time travel to stop the burn   let me know what you think in the comments ",why didn't the federation use time travel to stop the burn?

thoughts?",the inner light
3260,startrek,"i always enjoyed star trek series' since i was a kid continuing through today   some years ago, i realized that star trek is sci fi as a convenient fall back idea for a series, but it was really a show about a group of people who are faced with unusually difficult, never before seen ethical dilemmas, and how  the group and each individual is able to go against their animalistic instincts and choose a better course of action with individual moral restraint   i like this a lot about star trek   


a person or society as a whole can stereotype a lot of things about trekkies   but, on the whole, i don't think ""bad"", ""dangerous"", or ""evil"", nor any similar such negative adjective, could ever really be believed by anyone   nobody is scared of star trek fans   they're usually pretty ok or even really good people   even if they aren't rich or powerful enough to actually be considered ""eccentric"" and are just considered ""weird""   i like that about star trek a lot again   


enterprise never held my attention, though i honestly haven't ever tried hard yet   discovery, idk    i heard it basically ruins canon and has some issues and has this alternate timeline thing   i'm not sure the details, but it ""breaks the rules"", i hear      and i  did  see the jj abrams movie   the first of the three   it wasn't a bad movie    i liked it like i liked the star wars one     it was indeed in a ""star trek"" ish in appearance setting, but i didn't like it because it didn't feel like star trek and seemed more concerned with dramatic action and adventure than holding the crew and captain to high moral standards through extremely challenging trials and ethical decisions and dilemmas       


and then i just started picard   i like picard  i didn't realize it was a real star trek, as someone else described it to me as more of a sitcom in the star trek universe   in my opinion, though, it's the first legitimate sequel series to the tng, ds9, voy era series    and is official   and very good     i thought it was ironic that the first episode was about picard getting questioned why he left starfleet, and he discusses later the moral issue of the federation starfleet turning on their promises to protect romulans   which leads to a massacre of romulans   which leads him to reply, ""i left because it was no longer starfleet!""    


i feel like he is, at this point in space time, making a cool one off series that fades away,   or  , he is the beginning of the community of trekkies and star trek people as a whole who decide to forbid this new hollywood esque, hollow star trek stuff, and bring star trek series' and films back to what they do best and the way they are naturally supposed to be        


should the ds9 guys do a star trek  sisko to complement, along side?  they could even make both of them interact, but specifically exclude the new amoral actiony star trek malignant ideas, which we really ought to reclassify as ""fan fiction"" someday, but i degress   what do you all think?","star trek  not a sci fi per se, but a vision of a highly moral human society? is the new st picard series patrick stewart's attempt to revive that quality?"

from what i have gathered, shatner's sin is supporting the wrong austism charity, because they want to cure a condition that most level 1 autistics do not see as a disease  i get that  i support neurodiversity in every form  but why do we condescend to that selfish attitude? there are two other levels of autism, and those tend to be the marriage wreckers, the bankruptcies, and the lifetime of suffering    


i have two mothers in my family professional life with level 3 autistic sons  if you have never lived with a person in this condition, it's a lifetime of diapers, home supervision, and often outbursts of madness and violence  my client came to a meeting with stitches on her face from her l3a adult son throwing furniture when he couldn't find his blanket  there are many people living with autism and people in the autism community who do not have the freedom of a level 1 patient  the kind of a person with a job and plenty fo time to talk about star trek  shatner's cardinal sin seems to be that, even as a 90ish year old man, he still works to raise money for families like these   


moreover, shatner is not a nazi, a fascist, a racist, or even a republican  he's a liberal canadian jew and an old man who doesn't want to be bullied with the latest fashion progressive language  if you ask mark a  altman, author of the fifty year mission, he'll share with you detailed stories of his generosity, charity, and 100  non bigoted non nazi political skepticism  in short, ws is a skeptical old man   not an activist   


can someone further unpack the autism angle? are there missing facts? the call for mob violence this morning was my breaking point  i could care less about being booted from a group with 40 comments calling shatner a nazi, but it's reached the point where star trek fans need to stop condescending to the large community of l31s in trek  seriously, calling for a mob to take off his head?!","the campaign by autistic trek fans against william shatner is out of control, largely because fans condescend to the autistic mob "

  kovich's inside out holographic reconstruction of georgiou may be the same technology developed by the emh in ""latent image ""
  the hologram of yor is wearing a starfleet uniform most closely associated with tng's first two seasons, placing it between the 2350s and mid 2360s  yor is described as a lieutenant commander but his uniform collar is missing a rank 
  yor is of the same species as traitt in ""that hope is you "" initially identified as a yridian, it was noted in the ready room that the species is intended to be betelgeusian, though this has not been established in canon 
  kovich explains that temporal travel can ""make you pretty sick "" in ""relativity"" it was established that repeated time jumps could result in temporal psychosis 
  it is also explained that ""molecules"" don't like jumping around between time or dimension  in ""parallels"" worf's timeline jumping was confirmed by examining his quantum signature 
  yor's origins are described as an alternate universe created by ""the temporal incursion of a romulan mining ship "" this is a reference to the establishment of what we refer to as the kelvin timeline, the setting of the most recent ""abrams trilogy"" beginning with  star trek 2009   the mining ship belonged to nero, who went back in time after seeing the destruction of romulus in 2379  this is the first on screen acknowledgement of the kelvin timeline within the prime timeline, and its description as an ""alternate universe"" perhaps establishes it is somewhat different than a typical alternate  timeline  created by normal time travel shenanigans 
  kovich claims yor was heretofore the only person known to have jumped across both time and dimension  this also describes nero, his crew, and spock, as they jumped from pt 2379 to kt 2233 2258  it seems kovich knows the kelvin timeline exists but nothing more than that 
  yor died because the temporal accords prevented the federation from sending him home  this rigidity to rules and regulations at the cost of an individual's life doesn't sound anything at all like the federation we know and love, but does sound exactly like the federation that allowed thad riker to needlessly die, as related in ""nepenthe ""
  culber calls up a medical analysis which displays in front of him  the text is otherwise unremarkable, but refers to georgiou's condition using the phrase ""universal constant,"" which evokes the time travel rules not of star trek but of lost 
  dannus v is a new location, but it is close to the gamma quadrant  i believe this is the first mention of that region in the series 
  worf's calisthenics program may be a descendant of the  discovery's  gymnasium, which appears to include, um, bladed weapons 
  burnham gives georgiou a fitbit, a technology introduced in ""consumer electronics expo 2013 ""
  hiraga gennai was an edo era scientist known for    looks him up    the essay ""on farting ""
  carl reads the latest edition of  the star dispatch   the newspaper (which used to be a common fictional paper throughout hollywood) was previously seen in the projected alternate timeline where edith keeler survived in ""the city on the edge of forever ""
  on the back of the paper is a review of the soup at the twenty first street mission, which was the kitchen run by edith keeler  the accompanying picture is a stock photo of a real life depression bread line and i don't think it maps to trek 
  below the review is a stylized quote  ""let me help!"" keeler offered this sentiment to james kirk, who countered that in the future those words would be cherished even above ""i love you ""
  given all these extremely subtle freeze frame references, it is worth observing that ""edge of forever"" involved the crew finding a deserted planet hosting a portal, with a guardian, that allowed you to step back in time 
  a smaller headline on the front page of the paper reads ""supernova threatens tkon empire "" the tkon empire was featured in ""the last outpost"" and were an advanced society living 600,000 years ago until a supernova destroyed their homeworld  the only identified remnant of the tkon was in the form of an outpost guardian called the portal, asleep on a deserted planet  on a completely unrelated note, spock estimated the guardian of forever to be approximately one million years old 
  another reads ""starship uss jenolan reported to be missing "" the  jenolan  was en route to norpin colony in 2294 when it crashed into a dyson sphere  there were 1 467 survivors 
  the back page of the paper also features some ancient vulcan script, accompanied by a simplified idic symbol, crudely drawn as though it were a rune 
  there is a crossword puzzle on the back page, but it is composed of hexagons, not squares  i don't know what this could indicate, and the pattern of the grid isn't familiar 
  the price of the paper is 15 quatloos, the initial wager that kirk was untrainable in ""the gamesters of triskelion ""
  besides all that, georgiou's apparent time travel journey is also reminiscent of the orb of time in ""wrongs darker than death or night ""
  epsilon indi, in the prime universe, was an area of dispute for the triacus marauders in ""and the children shall lead ""
  kepler 174d is the name of a potentially habitable exoplanet discovered in 2014  i believe this may be the first mention of a real life exoplanet, although there are several stars featured in trek that have been found to host exoplanets after the fact

also, i have noticed this previously, but haven't mentioned this on reddit yet  who is keeping the pacing for the show? they go from time critical to we need 5 minutes of dialog, when they should've been blown away by then  captain the shields are at 52 , bam, 26 , bam, captain shields are down, bam, all of crewman schlekis belongings are lost in space again captain and we can't take another hit  beam me over captain, it's the only way you will make it through  are you sure xxxxxxx, we were just getting to know you and what will we do without your cooking? i am sure captain and as far as the cooking goes, you have neelix and the replicators (rim shot)  okay, we will beam you over  captain should i notify such and such that xxxxxxx is going to beam over? no, that's okay, i'm wearing my plot armor  see you in a bit, i will walk xxxxxxx to the transporters and were taking the long way  xxxxxxx do you need to pack before going over to the ship?

3308,startrek,"is there a trend here?  

first we have captain cristobal rios and the la sirena, quickly followed by seven and her ship, and now we brooke and his ship   small, fast freighters with some defensive capabilities, with a flat asymmetrical design, that were meant to be multipurpose and all set for some adventure 

there is a fictional appeal of han soloists, the maverick captain with his small ship daring all the odds thrown against it   i am not sure how it fits or still fits into trek lore   i don't know if there is some corporate pressure from the top to make shows more star warsy, or that more and more writers are internalizing star wars concepts and this is showing out unconsciously in their writing    the maverick and his ship certainly goes beyond star wars, as we have seen from whedon's firefly, and the upcoming live action cowboy bebop    its almost a universal thing in space opera and a foundational trope     with the han soloist you will see the accompaniment of a wild west, like this region of space we see in picard with the destitute romulan colonists, with law and order held by rangers   in discovery the wild west has expanded virtually to everything else, except for well defended pockets of civilization   

does it contradict the internal realism of the lore?   in almost every space lore we should expect to see small craft piloted by a captain and a small crew    within the realistic confines of the star trek universe, we can expect such things to happen   however, when relying on such devices, we take a risk with the show's special identity to avoid turning it to yet another space western

3321,startrek,"until two years ago, i didn't know much about star trek  i had seen some of the plinkett movie reviews and watched a portion of star trek iv around 2009 when i was 14  i was more of a star wars guy, albeit not a big fan 

but two years ago i started watching the next generation simply because i always found the show fascinating from the hilarious plinkett reviews  and oh boy, was it easy to get into  i fell in love from episode one  binged it through watching several episodes a day  next i watched all the films  then tos  then ds9  then voyager  then enterprise  then the kelvin movies  i even watched all the fan made episodes (new voyages  amp  st continues)!

after all that, i can safely say that star trek has become my favorite franchise ever  even though i'm only 25 and i just watched everything during the past 2 years, watching those old shows gives me a weird sense of nostalgia, it feels like i was there when the shows aired even though i wasn't  the stories of the shows and movies that spans several centuries is simply epic  the stories often give me a warm feeling since the vision of the future seems to positive, and most episodes end with a happy ending 

tos is certainly my favorite show, and era  many say it feels campy after over 50 years, but to me the series feels timeless, and still relevant today  i just love the 60's retro futuristic atmosphere and the talents of shatner, nimoy, kelley, doohan, takei, koenig and nichols are simply fantastic  i never grow tired watching them on screen  my favorite movies are wrath of khan and voyage home

my question is  how is khan and the other  super humans  or whatever they re called in the original series so strong? if they were bred from eugenics how is it that (from a total of 47 odd years between ww2 and 1993 which only leaves a few generations) they already have  50 percent more efficient breathing  and are significantly smarter and stronger than  regular  humans? that just seems way to short of a time

i can kinda, sorta, understand that engineering itself would be the recipient of lots of second hand internal systems damage, but the bridge? the small room at the very top of the ship?  surely its mostly computer interfaces, and not a whole lot of big massive power conduits

3330,startrek,"i'm going to be controversial on this sub and say that tng was good  why then were the tng movies so bad? they had more money, more time in between movies, the same writers, and the same cast, at least the first three do  not only that but they had examples of what good star trek movies looked like with the tos movies  

so why then do they suck so bad? even if you like one or two of them (i like first contact) you probably agree that even the best one doesn't live up to the standard the same cast and crew set with the show  

i think the problem is precisely that it's the same crew and writers behind the show  a big problem the tng movies share is that they feel like expensive tv movies, and it's because they were done by tv people  

maybe if rick berman had given it to someone new while he focused on his tv shows, we would've gotten what we did when harve bennett took over after rodenberry  then again that would've given him more time to interfere in ds9 so maybe it was for the best

 amp  x200b 

i'll start by saying that i'm not a huge trekkie  i've watched most of tos, tng and voyager, some ent and 1st season of discovery 

so if this is a stupid question, it's due to me not being too deep in the lore in general 

ok, with that out of the way, i'll elaborate on my question a bit 

many races get design changes over the different series 

consider for instance the tribbles episode from tos  the crew only realizes that one character is a klingon after bones took his temperature  yet in later series, klingons look very different and it's hard to believe that anyone would mistake a klingon for a human 

a similar point can be made about romulans  in the neutral zone, some of the crew project their hatred onto spock, because romulans and vulcans look more or less the same  in later series however, the two species look very much distinct 

i totally  get how much of this is due to budget and tos being a little trashy in general  but how does canon cope with it? are these things explained at all, and if yes, how so?

tos had spock, and only spock, as the only non human crew member (except for another vulcan in the mirror universe )  tmp had a forehead guy on the bridge, who didn't have much to do besides stand at his station

3347,startrek,"i was not sure after first watching it if this would hold as my favourite episode of anything, but it did  however, i was not sure why, and over time after first watching it in 2013 (and a couple of rewatches since) and trying to work out why the result is so effective, and have come to the conclusion that, for me, there are just many different emotions and reactions involved 

i have thought about this episode for way too long and can find many different interpretations that are compatible with each other  the more i think about it the more i am amazed, as each of the points below are also extremely powerful on their own  it's as if intended to merge multiple themes into one (whereas usually the episodic format limits them to 1) 

here they are for those interested 

  contentness with the knowledge that kamin eventually found peace in his relationships and managed to carry on with his memories of enterprise in the back of his mind, and that he led a calm and enjoyable life as kamin

this also relates to picard's backstory (never had children etc ), which people like to highlight, but i personally take a more abstract interpretation from this as it is quite a nice concept that things will eventually resolve themselves  however, his lack of prior family probably helped enable this 

  overwhelm at the point where he woke from the state

he finally discovers that all of the panic he felt at the start was genuine and he isn't mad, that his memories of the enterprise are real etc  and that he had to spend years fighting against people telling him otherwise  he was right all along 

throughout the episode you are left waiting for some kind of explanation to what is happening, and the reveal is beautiful imo 

  realisation that he was the sole person to be chosen to carry forward their memory 

there was uncertainty and suspicion at the beginning as to whether the probe is dangerous (brain rapes picard  he feels kidnapped at first  also, the government guy is suspect)  but as it turns out, the beam, nor his forced experience, was never malicious in the first place, and further to this, it self destructed after its mission was complete  their memory does not live on anywhere else 

so, there was only one probe, with a one time use  there is surely something special about being selected to experience these memories with picard 

  despair at the loss of their civilization due to the nova  all the characters you met over the last 40 minutes years are suddenly long gone, it exploded more than 1000 years ago 

you experience all of kamin's happy memories and are provided with a gist of the overall joy of kamin's life, but his family is gone in an instant (and the whole planet)  their deaths are also greatly exacerbated by the fact it would have occurred far back into the past 

so any hope the viewer might have had of picard somehow touching base with them (virtually or otherwise) is hopeless, and you realize that very rapidly, which is pretty damn heartbreaking 

  even more despair at the fact they weren't able to do anything about the nova, but in particular that they didn't even attempt it because they knew it was so hopeless

the government supposedly lied about the rocket's purpose, to keep people's hopes up  it was a white lie to keep people's happy  this would have been an immensely heavy decision in itself and you feel for the leaders (regardless of whether it was correct) 

the self reveal of his family saying 'remember us' towards the end makes this even more damming  there was nothing they could do 

  peace in the knowledge that they must have all died together, painlessly, and instantly, and they collectively knew it was coming 

in the self reveal they were smiling and had accepted their fate  they could be seen to be making the most of their situation even with death in sight (which we recognise as an incredible achievement, so it follows that we are extremely impressed, but they just in an incredibly weak position, so this is also heartbreaking 

  realisation that the same thing might happen to our solar system some day (or human extinction through some other means) so therefore we should be making the most of everything, and kamin's main quote (to his daughter) is this exactly, for me, this whole theme (or the effect if unintentional) is so immensely powerful that it forces me reflect on my life, intense periods of good and bad events, etc!

and then the flute at the end! he is feeling sad knowing the civilization is in the past    but also happy to have experienced it as kamin     but also likely desperately missing kamin's family   moreover, though, he is generally respecting their (and our?) civilization at the same time!

the above is all stating the obvious but it's just stunning! if the multi layering was intentional, then it is also genius  this was immediately my favourite regardless of the internet's hype about it, which i only discovered later, and is well justified ",the inner light   analysis

3420,startrek,"as anyone who's been watching the new season knows, the discovery's redheaded, cyborg implant wearing helmsman has been getting some more attention lately  i think that's a very good thing for a few reasons 

1   her personality is realistic   i know people like her   confident, witty, good at what they do, but they don't want to admit when they need help   until they crack under pressure  
2   she has flaws, and learns from them   i think the way she snapped at stamets in the dinner party scene was well written and was like a lot of arguments in the real world, and by including a character who struggles with stress and what appears to be some ptsd, star trek is shining a light on issues that don't get talked about but affect a lot of people  also, showing her recognize that she wasn't okay and going to talk to culber about it really encourages people watching who may be struggling with their own mental health issues to get help if they need it 
3  finally, on the flip side of that,  she's a really good pilot   her ""full manual control"" flying scene in ""the sanctuary"" was pretty darn cool  i got big star wars vibes from that whole part of the episode (in the best way possible), as well as her cocky attitude afterwards   which was a fun contrast to the other characters we've seen on the show so far  the conversation between her and ryn was nice, too   how she used her own experience with stress to relate to him and get him to help her (and having grudge along for the ride made the scene even better) 

overall, discovery needs its side characters, and at least in my opinion, they're the best part of the season right now   i much prefer hearing about what the bridge crew are up to than another burnham and book episode  for this reason, underdeveloped characters like detmer getting attention in episodes are really helping make this series more well rounded  nice job to emily coutts for bringing this character to life during the new season   here's hoping this pattern continues and the rest of disco's bridge crew get their moment in the spotlight!

  notable thoughts  

  early scene where kirk emerges after saavik fails the kobayashi maru test  the light behind kirk is incredibly bright and wonderful 
  early scene where kirk and spock are standing in the hallway after the kobayashi training  there's a giant glass globe thing that has etchings on it    a level of detail i've never seen before 
  enterprise in space dock and leaving space dock  'nuff said 
  regula one exterior shots are really, really crisp 
  mutara nebula exterior scenes  there's extra brilliance in the color, and bright bursts of light (nebula lightning, both the enterprise and reliant's ship lights) all really pop 
  spock messing around with the warp core reactor tore into my retina 
  little details like computer terminal commands and wall inscriptions are now legible 
  not a v related but this is the director's cut which i hadn't seen since the old dvd days 

  some bummers  

  there are a few scenes where the camera misfocused and the 4k footage exposes the errors  for example, kirk's facial reaction after drinking romulan ale with mccoy 
  some of the computer graphics at the time, like the 3 klingon ships as well as the genesis project video, all look incredibly dated  unlike the tos remastered project, the twok remaster didn't ""re create"" computer graphics

vi before tng obviously makes some sense because it's a direct sequel to the tos movies and you won't know how it would end with the klingons (seeing worf spoils that)  but then again, that's how everyone in the 1990s saw it

this explains many of the implausible rescues and missions the enterprise will go on to have over the rest of their years as well as riker's success with the ladies  

further near the end of star trek  generations riker flat out tells picard that he (riker) plans to live forever  a very unusual statement from a mortal starfleet officer  even kirk knew he'd die one day

if section 31 need to infiltrate some planet that have some teleport protection like discovery episode 08  i have an solution

  sure the easiest way out would be to land an cloaked shuttle or ship  easy

  but if they would detect this?

  well this kind of teleport protection was similar to an wlan or radio signal scrambler, right? 

  what would ""pc nerds"" do, if there are to many wlan interferences? right  they switch back to lan cable  

  so they shoot an teleport capsule from the ship or capsule to the surface linked with an thick protected ""teleportation lan"" cable  of course the cable must resist or block these interferences  

in sort  they got ""teleport lift"" with cable solution  

this can be used if there is no place to land the shuttle or ship, of course if they can penetrate the force fields

  this is some sort of airborne rangers in star trek ops way  no need to look if there are atmosphere for parachutes use  also this goes way faster (no need to sky jump like in kelvin timeline)

  send an independent capsule down that ""create"" tools for the mission from its database, like weapons (inspiration took out from games ""where do the unwieldy weapons go?"" solution) and stuff  they can fail safe protect the access if it falls into enemy hands

3489,startrek,"i mean this post as a rhetorical question concerning how the show continues to structure its season arcs  in season 2 there was a whole lot of postulation about who what the red angel was, and ultimately it was burnham  plenty of people speculated it could have been iconians, or some extra dimensional beings, but given how closed the bubble of the plot is, of course it was going to be burnham  

ultimately, the burn will either be caused by discovery travelling through time or burnham sending the time suit back into the wormhole to self destruct  it's far too easy  all the theories concerning the omega particle, q, a super weapon, etc , they venture too far outside the bubble of of the plot and how the show rotates its narrative  burnham is the centre of that narrative  if she isn't the cause of a problem, then she is the ultimate solution 

it ends up being both predictable and boring, and it's one of the inherent issues of presenting these large scale mysteries in a show that largely revolves around one person  if the mystery of the plot doesn't personally concern the main character, it's easy for the audience to get disconnected from the plot or ask the question 'why should the main character get involved'? 

one show that did this well was mr robot, but for an entirely different reason and one that i won't discuss at length because i wouldn't want to spoil the show for those who hadn't seen it  long story short, the main character, elliot, does something that he believes is right after a lot of internal fighting about whether or not it was right to do (and that many people would initially believe is right), and after the thing happens he realises that there were many repercussions that were outside his control and that there were powers at play banking on his success  in mr robot, the plot is solely elliot's story, how he affects his friends and family, and how he finds justice for the wrongs in his life  he's always playing catch up and attempting to out maneouvre those who would use his actions for their own gain 

fortunately for mr robot, it never had a big mystery to solve, but rather a continuous slow burn (no pun intended) of elliot fighting the interests of the other players  unfortunately for discovery, there doesn't seem to be much of a parallel in terms of drawn out plot or story outside of burnham's centrality to the story  

and i get that people will be mad at this post and react strongly  that's fine, there's a very wild and disturbing insanity on either side of the debate as to whether or not a person likes discovery or if it's a 'good' show, but i encourage everyone to think of how disconnected the episodes have generally been outside of burnham's screen time  for instance, what happened to the guy who sat at the same desk for 40 years? why doesn't admiral vance retrofit all the other starfleet ships with the spore drive (besides removing discovery's pivotal nature to the plot)? communication consistency within the show has made no sense, with ships worlds either able to communicate through subspace or not  why would a ship from the 23rd century have plant seeds from 'the whole galaxy' if the whole galaxy hadn't been explored then, and why would it be placed near a star? why didn't earth know about anything happening within their own solar system?

the reality of all these questions is that each story is just a way by which discovery fixes things  after all, what better way to end the season after building up so much goodwill than to have everyone discover it was the time suit that caused the burn in the first place?

the producers and writers visit this sub  it's why they've dived into making snw, because they think it'll satisfy some nostalgic craving for the 'good old days' of episodic stories  we don't want nostalgia  we want coherent, intelligent stories that don't continually hinge on the same person solving the problem  no more, no less

the episode is great up until the last ten minutes, so i dont know whether to say it is my favorite episode or my least favorite  it had such great potential  i mean dont get me wrong the ending was unique and i enjoyed the idea of it, but if felt so forced and quick  i am genuinely conflicted lol  

either way this is a great show and this episode takes nothing away from it at all  i am just a little confused at how i am in love with, and kind of annoyed by, a single episode   any thought on this episode? i would love to get yalls input even if you dont share my opinion  like i said it takes nothing away from this amazing show ",favorite star trek episode? maybe?

3502,startrek,"for me, the most exciting thing about discovery season 3 has been that we basically have a whole new universe to play with, one that could never be fully explored in just one show, so i thought i d throw a couple ideas for spin offs out there to see what you all think 

1  united earth defense force   with earth having become a somewhat isolationist entity post burn, i d love to see some of the conflicts they ve been involved in, either before or after discovery s visit  obviously a bit harder to do proper exploration, but the sol system is a big place without warp drive 

2  generation ship   in episode 3 4, we learn that adira reached earth on a generation ship, and i think it would be cool to see some of that journey  of course, seeing as adira is being pretty well fleshed out on dsc proper, it might make sense to focus on the ship at a different time, or a different ship altogether  either way, sub light interstellar travel opens up a ton of opportunities, and i can imagine the series working kinda like bsg, where there s an overall story and premise, but most episodes focus on various logistical issues that pop up on a centuries long journey 

3  the life of a courier   this would definitely risk treading into the same territory as the mandalorian, but it feels like the best way to really explore the post burn galaxy   a lone mercenary or small crew looking for dilithium and checking out all kinds of planets and civilizations 

what are your thoughts? do you like any of these ideas? what would you pitch?", spoiler  dsc s3 era spin offs
3503,startrek,"so in the next episode's bonus scene it s revealed that georgiou s atoms are not happy with a dimensional shift and a jump forward in time and will try to revert to their original timeline or dimension  

i bet that at the end of s3 she will snap back to the 23rd century without dying (probably the only way to save her life) and from there take over section 31 for her spinoff series ",theory  georgiou s section 31 spinoff results from her snapping back to the 23rd century at the end of s3

   in theory, anyway  in practice    i'm confused  if she is the collective, the manifestation of the will of the borg    why is she shown to verbally order her drones around on occasion? surely if her thoughts are their thoughts, she could order them through thought alone  on that subject, why is she always observing other cubes on a viewscreen? she sees the mind of every drone, surely she should know what's going on in every borg vessel

3515,startrek,"this cult believed that simply being a cog in a greater system, with no individuality, was something to be championed  how can you watch star trek, and think that the borg ideals are something to aspire to??

by the way, this was talked about in the first part of the third episode in the documentary series  it makes me both mad and sad that star trek was used in this way, to further a toxic cult

3518,startrek,just finished watching voyager s4 e25 where seven is on the ship alone while the crew is in stasis going through a nebula  seven develops hallucinations from degradation in her synaptic relays  that coupled with being alone for so long  the episode does a great job of making the analogy of how hallucinations occur for people with severe mental health issues   another great example of how star trek takes real world problems and puts them in a context people can understand  i hope the episode helped people to have a better understanding of mental health and more sympathy for people suffering from mental illness ,voyager episode about hallucinations

the truth is in the stars   
  

the conclusion shows a very affecting interview of shatner with steven hawking, where shatner is clearly moved by hawking and by the realization that his work had an influence on such a great scientist 
more indication of the affect and influence star trek had on people is the large number of fan made films that have been produced  some of these productions must have had a significant amount of financing to be made, with some including professional actors  no other tv series had actual productions by its fans made that continued on the themes explored in the show

3554,startrek," i wrote a guide for anyone who has yet to try star trek  the next generation  see what you think, agree, disagree, remember your favourite episodes! 

perhaps you want to watch  picard  or  star trek  discovery , but you ""probably should check out some of the older stuff first""  maybe you've always been curious about  star trek  the next generation  but ""that's a lot of episodes to get through   who has the time?""  or you watched the series when you were younger, and want to go back to it, but you're wary of  those  really bad episodes along the way 

in any case, i have a guide to help you  other people have delivered their verdicts on whether each episode is worth your time  i have gone a little further  so much of the  next gen  is golden   or at least a well crafted silver   but i have reduced the 7 seasons down to what i consider to be the very best episodes  

this list includes only   30   of the 178 episodes in the series   if each episode is 45 minutes long, that means that you have less than 23 hours of  next gen  remaining  even then, i've suggested a few that you could skip (but would be mad to do so)  i've also       highlighted       what i believe are five of the very best episodes  if you only want to take a quick dip in the  star trek  pool, you can be in and out in under 4 hours 

there may be some gaps in your understanding (where did that character go? how did that character come back?) but recaps are built into the dialogue of every tv series  this list is about getting you the best, most important bits 

  season 1      4 episodes  
  episode 1  amp  2   encounter at farpoint      it certainly makes sense to start at the beginning, and these two episodes set you up with what the crew (and the ship) are all about  you'll also see the show at the bizarre end of its sci fi spectrum, with the all powerful entity known as q  he is the most antagonising of antagonists, and he just loves to play god with  the enterprise    
  episode 26   the neutral zone      aaaand then skip right to the end of season 1  no, really  you want the abridged version? here it is  there are many great moments in the first season (and some horrendous ones   ) but it hasn't really made it's mark yet  the final episode is a step up though  you get a look at the romulans, a species with espionage practically built into their dna  you'll also get to see everyone on the crew at their best, and get a real taste of how the two main officers on the crew make such a great partnership 

  season 2      4 episodes  
  episode 8   a matter of honor      now that you've seen a little romulan, have a whole heap of klingon, the drunken pub fight empire  riker, the ship's second in command, is temporarily assigned to a klingon ship for reasons, and he must embrace their violent and cut throat lifestyle to survive  he does, and it's  really  fun to watch   
            episode 9   the measure of a man            this is my first favourite on this list  why? well, nothing happens  no phasers and fired, no one throws a punch, there is zero peril   it is, on the other hand , entirely captivating  you also get to really see one key element of the show  really good acting that elevates the source material  this episode is 'only' concerned with the question of whether or not data, the ship's android, is alive or not  the court case that ensues is a delight   
             episode 16   q who             oh man, this is the other reason i love  sta r  trek   the episode starts with the return of the reality bending q, who amuses himself at the crew's expense    before drawing back the astral curtain to reveal one of the (in my opinion) best villains monsters in all science fiction  if you don't know the borg, well i don't want to spoil too much  visually they are somewhere between goofy and creepy (as only tv monsters can be) but in terms of villainy they tick a lot of boxes  it's the air of inevitable doom that does it for me   
  episode 20   the emissary       next generation  likes to occasionally attempt a romantic story, and it usually falls flat  either the affair is sickeningly sweet, or one or more of the people involved comes across like a sex pest  in this case, the romance is fun to watch  on one side, a human raised klingon officer desperately clinging to tradition, and on the other is a half human, half klingon with a firm belief in being true to yourself  it's an  angry   passion, and it's delicious  the rest of the episode is also great  

  season 3      6 episodes  
             episode 10   the defector               next gen  hits a confident stride in season 3, almost every episode is wonderful  this one is an absolute gem  intergalactic politics, romulan shenanigans, twist and turns, high grade acting  all tremendous    
  episode 13   d j  q      if you're not a fan of q by now, skip this one  if like me, you enjoy his brand of megalomania, this is a truly fun time  this isn't about him causing a problem though  this time it's all about q  his arrogance, his vulnerabilities and his total lack of empathy    
  episode 15   yesterday's enterprise      if you've followed this guide up until now, there's a bit of continuity missing for this episode  a main character made a surprising (and underwhelming) exit in an earlier season, and wibbly wobbly time allows for a reappearance  nonetheless, this is a superb story about trying to reset a broken timeline, only to cause more cracks to appear   
  episode 17   sins of the father      i swear i've not put every worf episode on this list, but some of the best political wrangling and tensest character moments take place in the klingon centric episodes  this one tells you more about the angry, war driven, assassin filled society than any previous instalment   
  episode 23   sarek      there's a lot of emotions in this one  you    have to see the episode to know why that's actually a very clever line    um    so anyway, at its core this is an episode about a brilliant, intelligent, widely respected person who refuses to accept his senility  it hits a lot of emotional points, and hits them hard  the acting is sensational too  the scenery is comprehensibly chewed   
             episode 26   the best of both worlds, part i              this  is how you end a series  again, you might just watch this and the next episode and get the best image of  next gen   i will say no more about it, other than to say   

  season 4      4 episodes  
             episode 1   the best of both worlds, part ii                   both these episodes rule   
  episode 7   reunion      if you're not a klingon fan like myself, or you weren't that into the romance story in ' the emissary ', then you could step past this  if you enjoy the angry love and klingon politics, you'll want this episode  it's another episode aiming for your emotions, so be warned   
  episode 24   the mind's eye      it's the  machurian candidate  in space  brainwashing and murder  fun fun fun   
  episode 26   redemption, part i      even if you're only watching the episodes on this list, you will by now see all the elements that make  star trek  great  political intrigue and back stabbing, complex alien cultures, fun twists and turns, acting greater than a sci fi tv series ever needs  this two parter has all those elements, woven together with great skill   next generation  certainly knows   

  season 5      5 episodes  
  episode 1   redemption, part ii         how to get you hooked for the next season   
  episode 3   ensign ro      ro is a character that should have gone somewhere, but the actor wanted to go somewhere else  nevertheless, this is a intriguing episode that proves that not everyone in starfleet is a goody two shoes, and tackles the topic of 'refugee crisis' in a fascinating way that stays clear of heavy handed messages   
  episode 18   cause and effect      every sci fi worth its salt has a time loop episode  this take on the concept is one of the best, because there isn't one person reliving each day in detail  instead the  whole crew  feels the creeping panic of the most intense deja vu, but never fully remembers what is happening when things reset  luckily, this crew is super smart   
  episode 23   i, borg      a single borg drone is disconnected from the collective and held on the  enterprise   rather than punting the thing into space (which picard would happily do right from the start), the crew decides to experiment  all good stuff   
  episode 25   the inner light      you  could  skip this episode  the only aspect of the  enterprise  involved in this story is picard  it's a standalone story  you  should  absolutely watch this episode, however, because it is a wonderfully emotional and captivating story  if you're off to watch  picard  after this,  the inner light  will make the captain's life story so much more compelling 

  season 6      4 episodes  
  episode 10   chain of command, part i      imagine watching a show for six seasons, and then they changed the main character mid season  you'd find it hard to watch  well, that's actually a deliberate point of this episode  the  enterprise  is needed for a special mission, and a militaristic, regimented officer temporarily takes over the ship  and picard? he and his officers go special ops for a brief spell     
  episode 11   chain of command, part ii    which leads into an episode that i will say nothing about, except that this one is very hard to watch, but in a very good way   
  episode 14   face of the enemy      troi, the ship's counsellor, has to pretend to be a romulan  i've skipped a lot of troi centred episodes (and some were  very  easy to skip) but this one deserves your attention, and has some of the best political chicanery so far   
  episode 21   frame of mind      an episode where nothing is what it seems, everything is a lie, where even the plot twists may may not be make believe  just wonderful  

  season 7    4 episodes  
  episode 11   parallels      huh    if your following this list, then you're watching two reality bending episodes in a row  they are widely different concepts, with a focus on different crew members  honestly, this entire episode is worth it for a brief riker vs riker moment at the very end   
  episode 12   the pegasus      so much of season 7 is actually quite mediocre, without a lot to add to the legacy of the series  this episode is a big diamond in the rough  oodles of slow burning tension, officers questioning right and wrong, lies and mysteries between friends and one of the cutest moments between picard and riker you'll ever see   
  episode 25  amp  26   all good things       having taken the shorter road to the end, these last two episodes may not feel as significant  they certainly aren't the best episodes on this list  it's some of the biggest and boldest sci fi you'll see, but it might also leave you a bit winded  what is important, at least to me, is that these two episodes demonstrate one of the rare times that a science fiction tv show goes out with grace  some try for one last season and fall flat, others are shut down before they can even say 'conclusion'    star trek  the next generation  brings in q to bookend the series, raises the stakes to the highest degree, before delivering a beautifully tender final scene that is just right 

  final thoughts    
i watched most of  star trek  the next generation  when i was younger, and recently revisited the whole series and the movies before taking a run at  picard   reflecting on all the episodes this way really reinforces how much of this show is just so much fun  the majority of episodes are full of interesting moral dilemmas, political mysteries, inspired science fiction and wonderful acting 

i did feel a bit guilty about some of the episodes culled  there's a two part story where spock shows up, removing those made me feel cruel  if you disagree with my choices, and think that other episodes should be on this list, well    isn't that just further proof of how great this series is? let us know!

i would, of course, recommend you watch the whole thing, if you have time  or at least,  most  of it  maybe i'll do another list of the absolutely skippable episodes  you know, like the one with implied ghost human intercourse    or the one where the writer's tried to make a statement about apartheid and ended up being weirdly sexist    or when a virus makes the crew lose all their inhibitions

3589,startrek,"throughout the newer shows, star trek is toying with its legacy characters  half the tng crew show up in picard, seven and janeway are back, we've got the titan, pikes leading a series etc   

so why not have a ""where are they now?"" sort of show  it would need to be animated, as these actors have all aged or passed on, or in some cases are too expensive  but imagine, 10 13 episodes to do an x years later sequel series  you could do this with the following 

enterprise  show the final days of the romulan war, and the birth of the federation

tos  after tas, finish the fifth year of this crews voyage, and have them return home

tmp tff  there's big time jumps for the movies, and there are unseen adventures following the motion picture, and in the gap before the undiscovered country  definitely a possibility

tng  show us a prequel series for picard, and his rise through the starfleet ranks  

ds9  none of the ds9 crew have been touched sine nemesis, so it's clear to me there's a plan for them  even though certain cast members are now gone, animation would be an honourable way to carry on their legacies

voy  how does this crew settle back into alpha quadrant life? what happens to voyager when janeway leaves? what breaks up chakotay and seven, and drives her away? does kim ever get a promotion!?

kelvin timeline  the expensive cast was the reason this was cancelled, so new voice actors, and a slashed animated budget would solve both those problems, and provide a litmus test into whether this universe is worth keeping around

as this would be a set of anthology series, it sets these shows up and reinvigorates the characters for potential future use  there are stories here that don't warrant a full 7 year run, but could still deserve a 1 season continuation","star trek  legacies, my pitch for a show"

   nick fury had half his face blown off by kodos or something?  and has to wear a black mask over half it now?     in the time of star trek, they can't do better than doctors today can with a skin graft or whatever?  bummer 

   roddenberry predicted so much of the future correctly    but the computer can't merge the two photos of kodos or compare them for similar points?  kirk has to rely on feelings instead (surprise   it's a kirk specialty!)

   lenore karidian (kodos' daughter) is supposed to be 19 years old  nineteen   she's still barely a teenager, and she's 30 something year old kirk's love interest for the episode   rewatching today (and not as a kid to whom everyone over 15 seemed ""old"") this just looks creepy   ""you cared about her, didn't you?"" mccoy asks at the end   ""yes, doctor   i knew her for five minutes but she had really dreamy eyes and a kicking figure ""

   i still have no idea how to make sense of star dates   i'm pretty sure they're just randomly generated numbers 

   dr  mccoy is the worst friend ever (and probably not great at his job) when mr  spock comes looking for advice and all bones can do is drink and suggest that kirk has the hots for the 19 year old   ""if you won't join me, at least don't judge me    until you've tried it!""

   ""all the power of this ship, surging and throbbing    are you like that captain?""  ugh   pretty porno for 1960s tv, wasn't that?

   kodos killed half of his people because he thought there weren't enough resources to go around?     so this is where thanos got the idea 

   nichelle nichols has a beautiful voice   but that song went on for a looong time 

   don't drink the milk, riley!  someone sprayed it with an old plastic spray bottle full of windex or something!     that spray bottle sure took me out of the moment 

   if anton karidian wasn't kodos, he sure is a suspicious seeming dick to captain kirk when he comes to question him   way to make yourself look innocent, pal 

   it's really too bad that this is the last episode with lt  riley   he was a good character, and i would've liked to see more of him   i might even take him over chekov 

   ok, let's revisit barbara anderson as lenore  she played super cray cray bonkers pretty damned well   kudos to kodos!  or, er, kodos' kiddo 

overall  there's a reason i rarely rewatch this episode   is it anyone's favorite?  i'd love to hear why if so   this is a middling 5 10 from me   still felt very season one ish, meaning underdeveloped ","tos re watch thoughts  ""conscience of the king"""

3638,startrek,"star trek s speculated economy has piqued people s interests for decades  one thing is certain  money does not exist in the federation 

there are many ways justifications for this, but let s end one right here  it is not a post scarcity society  yes, replicators exist in star trek, but they only existed in next generation and not in the original series  the original series only had protein synthesizers  so the moneyless society of the federation existed before replicators were invented  also, some things can t be replicated  dilithium, which is a power source for warp drives, and (ugh) latinum 

so the federation s economy gets along fine without money or endless resources  additionally, we are shown that people on earth can seemingly own vast tracts of land, like picard s brother with his french vineyard 

several economic systems can manage this 

1   an advanced version of the commons (i m not an expert on this), where people can just pick up and own whatever they have  this may be the reason there are several colonies on other planets  lack of space on earth made them find new places to live  a single dude could own his own planet 

2   cooperation and negotiation  there are many names for this, but essentially the distribution of resources is negotiated by individuals  it s never shown, but perhaps kirk, picard and mccoy all debate on who gets what room at the federation hotel kaiser 5, instead of it going to the person with the most money  i d imagine it could get very bureaucratic, such as needing to write a letter to the city council if you want to get a 2 acre beet farm ",star trek s economy isn t that complicated or mysterious
3639,startrek,"to be fair i think the producers of discovery were very wise to dovetail in active links to stos and to morph discovery way into the future to avoid canon issues  we are about to watch discovery season 3 episode 8  the show is 'enjoyable' and worthy of watching  but does it invoke the same sense of caring about the characters at any of the past st series? i don't think so  i've tried to care about this woman that out of the blue is spock's adopted sister that the entire series orbits about  really i have    maybe too hard but i'm sincere 

my level of caring about any of the players in discovery is less than it is for any of the new characters that, by season 3, i found myself relating to in any of the previous series  i'm watching it because it is 'star trek' but i'm not finding myself drawn in  at times i feel like i'm watching one of the 'transformers' movies where the action is so non stop your eyes sort of blur and you zone out 

surely someone out there feels the same way  i'm not disrespecting the series  i'm just saying, from a buy in standpoint, is the lessor of any that preceded it

and now i'm wishing they'd done some subplot about a cover up of this fact  i tend to get annoyed with over use of section 31, but protecting the tactical advantage of being able to teleport at the cost of sacrificing everyone who teleports(since it does replace them with a perfect copy) seems like exactly the kind of mission they'd have 

the best scifi teleporter i've ever seen, in regards to ""do you die or not from this?"" is dark matter(a fucking crime that that show got cancelled)  the way that one works, is you go into a coma, and a perfect copy of you is created at your destination  that copy does whatever it is you need to do over there, and then gets back into the pod, where it is deconstructed(and yeah, the clone would be aware that it was gonna die when this was all over), and then the new memories it generated are written into your brain

 ''all i heard when i was little was how deceitful the federation was  how they'd turn on you      you want to scare an andorian child, tell them they're going to a federation summer camp     '  '       ryn

i believe the federation really messed up on caring about the individual planet's (this almost happened once to andoria in memory beta content) needs  amp  what ryn says is a result of that  granted he was born into the emerald chain, and the orions were always shown as antagonistic to the federation  but a century can't drastically change the opinion molded for a millenia unless something truly serious happened  (and how on   insert planet   did andorians team up with the orions)

the first 2 sentences that ryn says make sense in the 32nd century, said either due to influence by orions or even by the federation's actions (exploiting you for the needs of many may seem like turning on you)  but children being scared doesn't happen through tales about deceitful, untrustworthy or uncaring entities, it happens through stories of an evil, scary or ''bad'' entities  this probably means the federation went even crazier on andoria than the ni'varrans (as it is unlikely they were scared of it), making themselves see mlike the bad guy

then   lots of tragic gays shit happened  then culber's death  i was very unhappy with the situation in season 2, especially when even after we got culber back from the dead, it seemed like their relation was toast  it felt like a ""have your cake and eat it too"" situation where they were trying to have gay people and avoid any of that pesky being gay on screen 

ffwd to season 3 and they're a happy couple again (seems sudden but, whatever, the less they drag it out the better), they act like a real couple and fight kiss on screen, and while it's a bit weird for non binary to even be a thing anyone is nervous about in the 3200s, it's nice that stamets got to be the one having that talk and he was perfect in it  and his little smirk in that scene, my god 

anyway, i love my space gays and it seems discovery has learned to not fuck with them anymore and just let them be part of the crew properly  

screw rick berman by the way or we could have quite possibly had this conversation over ds9 (garak and bashir  watch the early seasons, it's so obvious) ",stamets culber in s3 is perfect so far
3669,startrek,"it's common knowledge of the tendency for trek shows to have a rocky first season, a better but mixed second season, and then a good third season  and mostly smooth sailing from then  tng is a prime example, but it also applies to voyager, ds9 and enterprise  the only ones exempt from this rule are tos, which had only 3 seasons and seemed like a rollercoaster of quality up and down until a lesser s3, and tas, which basically has 1 season, but it's split 16 6 across both seasons weirdly

anyway, the term ""growing the beard"" is obviously a reference to how riker grew a beard for season 2 of tng, which coincidently resulted in a better season for tng  and i think discovery has grown it's beard

the first season was mixed to say the least  i hold to my heart that magic to make the sanest man go mad is one of the great time travel episodes in the franchise, and the characters are mostly all charming and likeable, but their journey is more of a slow walk through mud  we spend half of it in the mirror universe, part of it is all about burnham's disobedience, and then the rest is sort of just filler between those two beats  and the enterprise arrival at the end seems to be a begging to entice the show to be renewed (if it wasn't already bts) just like the best of both worlds before it  but instead of pulling this card after 3 seasons, they're pulling it right out of the gate? 

the second season is a major shift though, we get the show being embedded into the star trek universe, more familiar faces and places show up, and pike literally kicks the crew into being    well    a crew  we get discussions of faith like new eden, classical throwbacks like if memory serves, and a season wide mystery about the red angels  it still hangs onto some of the weaker elements of the first season, like tyler and the klingons, but the new stuff is more than enticing 

then the third season had a lot to prove  was this raise in quality a product of bringing in these legacy characters like pike? or better quality on the show? and it seems to be the latter  now i thought the first episode was a disappointment  it seemed like it was the zany michael from the first season all over again, throw in a few action scenes, and that's it  but starting with the second episode, we get that volta with the time jump, we see the emotional effects of their journey, we get resolution to story arcs 30 years in the making, they develop these characters further in both their weakness and their strengths, they have a mission, they have a mystery, and god damn you know they're gonna solve it  every episode except the first has been a rollercoaster for me  and saru man, finally he gets his long overdue promotion and he is already surpassed numerous other main cast captains  sure, it's his first days of captaincy, but he accepts the role in full swing, and is more than competent  he is not afraid to sanction his officers, but he's not going to ignore their personal lives like picard either  he is driven by protecting and discovering, but he's not going to break every rule in the book to get to that point like a few captains we've known  

it's clear now why the show is renewed for season 4 and filming, and now we can get a better picture of why cbs want this baby to run the whole 7 seasons  if you want to move the franchise forward, it helps to have the show move forward in time, like literally all the other series apart from ent before it, which arguably was such a step back in time, that trek lost it's footing and fell over  now in the future, they can write their own future without being bound by tos edging closer and closer  and i hope to see this show ride on as it is now",star trek discovery has finally grown it's beard

in latin american spanish it's even worse! it's ""nunca me he sentido como una persona, entonces prefiero 'ellos'"", which means ""i never identified as one person, so i prefer 'they'""  the translator completely misunderstood it (probably based on their trill memories) and thought that ""they"" here refers to them feeling as a plural entity instead of just one person 

out of the languages i've checked, only the translator to spain spanish actually used non binary pronouns used by spanish people (""elle"") instead of, at best, using a calque of ""they"" as a plural form that isn't actually used much in a given language ",adira   disappointing translations

but seriously, those galaxy ships taking out the galor   is there any reason we can t get that now?",the battle in  sacrifice of angels 
3697,startrek,"i m rewatching the tng ds9 voy episodes in air date order  i m now watching  the chase   and after all the times i ve watched this episode, and i m old enough to have watched it when it first aired, i still love this episode 

  norman lloyd  i mean, to see him with patrick stewart is such a treat 
  john cothran, jr   such a fun spirited klingon  his scenes with data are tng comedy done well (not something done that often) 
  linda thorson  perhaps it s a recipe for biscuits  seeing cardassians in tng interwoven with ds9 really helps cement ds9 as part of the star trek universe (and of course it is, but it s nice to see them this way 
   perhaps one day   the whole story of humanoids dna carrying a message for eons is such classic star trek  crisscrossing the galaxy, battling cardassians and romulans while trying to piece together a puzzle as old as life itself while maintaining humor throughout is everything st v wanted to be but wasn t 

and permit an older fan to wax nostalgic  back in the before the internet was really a thing days, there was a fan theory of  the providers,  which i can t remember if they were associated with the triskelions or not it s been a while  but the fan theory was that they were the first humanoid life and they scattered their seed across the galaxy, and many of the humanoid life we see in the 23rd century (tos days) were from them  that explained why so many aliens looked roughly human like  i mean, costume and makeup budgets and technology being what it was in the 60s and 70s 

so to see salome jens as this first of the humanoid life felt like a fan theory confirmed back in 1993 

also, salome jens also made my watch of ds9 confusing  ds9 premiered as i was graduating college, and i wasn t able to give it the same viewing on tv as i had tng  recognizing her as the changling as well as the proto humanoid life, i went many, many years thinking that changlings were the proto humanoids  it wasn t until i finally watched ds9 the first time that i recognized that seriously bad misread ",the chase (tng 6x20) such a great episode

3699,startrek,"in tng chief o'brien was a somewhat polished, polite, reliable, solid and matter of fact officer who was just sort of cool and got it  i guess we start to see hints of what miles would become later in the series  we see his temper in data's day under very understandable circumstances when his fiancee keiko calls off their wedding  we see his temper again under an alien influence in a later episode  and we see him get just a little short with a cardassian one time  

but we really don't see the cranky curmudgeonly chief o'brien until deep space nine when he goes basically all rough around the edges, blue collar, working stiff with a perpetual temper  

is it character development? did he grow into this? or are we just seeing that side of him more on deep space nine since his character gets more focus  is it the stress and fatigue of his added responsibilities as a father and chief engineer?",what happened to chief o'brien between series?

3702,startrek,"i was always troubled by guinan s conversation with riker in the ready room following picard s abduction and assimilation in  the best of both worlds  part ii  (season 4, episode 1) 

it was an excellent and persuasive argument that riker needed to receive in order to proceed in the manner that was necessary  a ship can only have one captain, we must all let go of picard, and you can trust me on that because our relationship goes beyond friendship and family   and you know it 

guinan s  motivational  argument was borne from a pessimistic and defeatist stance, which is so uncharacteristic of this world and it never sat right with me, even consider that guinan s people were nearly wiped out by the borg 

i posit that guinan was only able to make this painful argument to riker because she held the knowledge that the events of  time s arrow, part i  (season 5, episode 26) and  time s arrow, part ii  (season 6, episode 1) had not yet occurred ",hypothesis  guinan knew that she could safely and convincingly counsel commander riker to abandon picard when he was assimilated by the borg because she knew the events of time s arrow had not yet taken place

  episode 37   ""the sanctuary""  

  there is an episode of ds9 called ""sanctuary,"" though it has no resemblance whatsoever to this installment 
  the subplot of the episode revolves around saru choosing a command catchphrase  carol freeman faced a similar dilemma in ""envoys ""
  michael warns against book's ship surviving ""transwarp "" transwarp has had multiple meanings over the years, from  excelsior's  experimental propulsion system to the borg's preferred method of travel to the new invention in ""threshold "" generally speaking, it is the ""next step up"" from regular warp drive 
  emerald chain's mo seems to be roaming the galaxy solving problems at steep prices  the eponymous gang in ""think tank"" had a similar role 
  we get a slightly better look at the map in vance's office, and the previously seen ""klingon zone"" includes the homeworld of qo'nos 
  osyraa fiddles with a combadge from the pic era 
  osyraa's lair is filled with scrap, and at 6 10 there is a passing shot of a console with a round central display and a joystick  although it seems to be connected to some kind of dilithium end portal, i would not be surprised if it was a callback of some kind, but i would have no idea where it would be from 
  tolor is tossed into a room with a giant ravenous creature, a staple of the franchise  well, not  this  franchise   
  the hidden signal is an sos hidden under a melody  in ""menage a troi"" riker took background noise and hid an sos in the form of a melody  additionally, the last time a crew found a distorted song being broadcast was in  the voyage home  
  detmer is here established as something of a hotshot pilot, evoking tom paris, who would take the  delta flyer  out for side missions and joyrides 
  osyraa's ship is called the  viridian   the veridian system is where the  enteprrise d  was destroyed ","canon references   ""the sanctuary""  spoilers "

3716,startrek,"i put this as an answer to a question in another post and i also put it in the discovery group but feel it should be spread to the masses and therefore put here 
my fave star trek shows are in order 
disco, tng, voy, tos, ent, ds9, picard 

i thought picard was terrible   almost gave up halfway through the season   forced myself to finish it   got better but still overall weak   story arc was not interesting   acting was forced   sets looked cheap   production value just seemed very b movie ish
discovery one the other hand for me is the total opposite   everything i ve ever wanted in a star trek show   it delivers on depth in characters, versatility in the story, literally going places noones has been before, each season has had great leads and supporting cast, michael burnam is fantastic   headstrong, dynamic, emotional, leads from the front, real nice the way they have centred the show on someone who isn t the captain   love the bravery   most importantly i love the actual sci fi in the show   the multiverse, the spore drive, the tech in the 32nd century, i love how they explored spocks youth, georgiou should get an award for best supporting actress   another great addition to the best sci fi show on tv since       i actually can t think of a better one    it s only rival is the expanse and the last season of that was terrible",discovery is the best star trek show   michael is the best star trek character why the hate!??? change my mind  )
3717,startrek,"some brief thoughts on adira s character from discovery 3x8  sanctuary   mild spoilers below  (the title is tongue in cheek but i couldn t resist )

 gt !i m really glad to finally see a non binary character, and i really like their portrayal overall, especially in episode 3x4  forget me not , which is one of my favorite of the series, and perhaps of star trek generally  how they handled them coming out to stamets, however, feels a bit anachronistic (in the sense of being out of  the crew s  time, not out of our own time)  it wasn t necessary to have a big coming out scene and then a later scene where stamets and hugh use their pronouns about 15 times in the course of a few sentences just to drive it home  i get the significance, and i get that star trek has always been a way to tell stories about contemporary humanity, but when it comes to matters of race, gender, and sexuality, it s generally done so best when it s shown what a more inclusive world looks like, rather than projecting our current inadequacies into the future  adira should just be a non binary character like stamets and hugh are gay, uhura is a black woman, etc , and everyone should know, and we should periodically see how that affects them, etc , but it shouldn t be a big deal 

in an episode of the babysitter s club earlier this year, there was a transgender character, and it  was  a big deal to her, and there was a scene in which someone had to be dressed down for not referring to her properly  that was appropriate, because it took place in the 21st century! i d hope by the 32nd century we d be well past the need for that ! lt ",battle of the non binary star
3718,startrek,"or at the very least, not hated it? i've seen the start of all the second gen series and i haven't hated any of those seasons at a whole  ds9 was mostly (mostly) unremarkable, with not a lot of episodes i remember from a year on  nothing super bad, just unmemorable  tng and voy had a bunch of interesting episodes that held up well, and ent had a bunch of good action episodes  a bunch of those episodes are even some of my favorites  you could argue they're not as good overall as later seasons, but i don't see most of them as outright bad ",has anyone else liked a series right out of the gate (besides tos)?

ensign ro is back in the federation fleet from being stranded undercover in the colonial fleet as admiral cain   clearly she's aged   wiser, a razor

3777,startrek,"something occured to me the other day about the mirror universe 

terran history diverged from human history since at least zefram cochrane's time and likely well before then (ent  in a mirror darkly) 

it would be unbelievably unlikely that hundreds or thousands of years after diverging that any of the same people exist in both universes given the differences between terrans and humans  people would choose partners differently or die before reproducing or any number of other factors would lead to entirely different sets of people in both universes 

however, in all the mirror universe episodes across the franchise everyone always has a counterpart 

obviously the real answer is that it is a convenient plot device, but this must imply some kind of metaphysical reason that explains it in universe  does the universe require balance on an individual level? what about the ships that are carbon copies of each other with different paint jobs? even crews can remain largely the same between them  the implications of any reason for this could be very profound if explored

3779,startrek,"(marked for discovery spoilers)  
so i'm relatively new to the show (introduced through discovery  amp  picard, working my way through next generation currently) so feel free to make me aware of inaccuracies, but these two schools of thought genuinely fascinate me, not so much for their differences, but for their similarities 

if i understand it correctly 

  vulcan philosophy seeks purely the path of logic in order to find and express the ultimate truth 
  the qowat milat's way of absolute candour seeks purely emotional transparency to find and express the ultimate truth 

despite the opposing method of revealing the truth, the essence of their intent is the same and the self discipline (meditation, training, etc) required to achieve these extremities is also very similar 

to combine them, so that is to be both emotionally honest and logically sound minded, would be a very powerful philosophy to maintain  knowing you are speaking truthfully about your emotions implies you are distinctly aware of what those emotions are  awareness of their existence allows you to better understand their source and nature  to then temper but not repress these emotions based on their source but as an onlooker through a locus of logic would result in an answer that is both emotionally aware and logically sound  

this would likely achieve more in a socially diverse society (like ni'var) that requires solutions to a range of viewpoints than it ever would in a homogenous society like on (old) vulcan 

perhaps this would be the ultimate philosophical understanding burnham needs to come to in discovery in order to properly find her place again, not only in starfleet, but also as a member of vulcan and human society  her conclusion to withdraw her request in the latest episode could point towards this development!

are there any examples of vulcans or romulans like this in canon? i'd love to know!     ",similarities between the way of absolute candour  amp  vulcan philosophy (discussion)
3780,startrek,"what i really mean is, how important is the position of ""first officer"" important?

in tos, spock was the science officer  he was also the first officer, but really, most of the time, to anyone watching, he was a science officer  his uniform was science blue, not command gold  sure he'd sit in the captain's chair when kirk was away, but aside from that, he didn't have any big first officer duties as far as i can recall 

in tng, however, riker was the full time first officer, without any other role  the enterprise d is a heck of a lot bigger, so it makes sense they might need more management type positions to organize the crew 

with discovery, we're back to a small crew, so i wonder if the formal position of first officer is necessary  yes, of course someone has to be second in command, since that's how the chain of command works, but it seems like they could have gotten away with demoting burnham's, and just making sure someone besides saru outranks her ",does a ship really need a first officer?

3786,startrek,on a scale of tos to warhammer 40k?,so far how terrible do you think life is the universe post 'burn'?
3787,startrek,"i'm writing this with an open mind, as a lifelong fan of trek, hoping that someone can perhaps answer my criticisms in a way that might make me see discovery differently   


i grew up watching tng with my dad  i've watched every episode of every show multiple times    even enterprise, which i thoroughly enjoyed despite the general consesus that it wasn't all that good  in discovery's first two seasons i had the same problems as everyone else, mostly around how the show seemed to trample all over established canon  but despite this, i more or less enjoyed the first two seasons  but i find myself unable to stomach the third season  i'll jump right into the reason why   


in season 3, being 900 years out of place has forced the crew to come together as a family  this is a character building element that a lot of fans wish voyager had had more of  but with voyager, the maquis   starfleet angle got resolved much too soon, everyone but b'elanna seemed completely resigned to the realities of their lifelong journey almost immediately, and it's as if janeway's decision to continue running the ship as if it were still a starfleet vessel in the alpha quadrant curtailed either the writers' desire or ability to portray voyager as a nascent family rather than a crew of colleagues  discovery won't make the same mistake  a crew stranded among strangers naturally becomes a family  ok, good  but we know   nothing   about over half the regulars on the show  and for me, that completely undermines the overarching story they're trying to tell   


in season 3, the bridge crew aren't individuals  they're a singular character    the bridge officers    that get brought out for, honestly, cringy, campy scenes like reminiscing under the tree at starfleet academy, or sharing a meal with saru, or smiling and going 'ah cool!' as they get new badges, or one by one telling tilly to ''just say yes,'' despite the fact that she may be the most unqualified commanding officer that we've ever seen (it would be like janeway giving harry kim the position as first officer over chakotay or tuvoc, but if harry kim had no self confidence or leadership qualities whatsoever)  but why did tilly get the nod? well, who else could have?! who is rhys? who is bryce? who is owosekun (i had to look up her name because i forgot)? who is the blonde woman whose name i literally don't even know despite the fact that she's in every scene with the bridge crew? what do we know about detmer besides the fact that she has ptsd from flying the ship through the wormhole?   


the bridge crew are basically extras  they show up once in awhile, smile, clap, give each other hugs, and then we get back to the michael burnham show  and i didn't mind it being the michael burnham show during seasons 1 and 2  sure, it bothered me that the bridge crew were an irrelevant afterthought without backgrounds, whose names i couldn't even remember most of the time, but it wasn't detrimental to the overarching narrative  in season 3, however, the writers are trying to tell me that these clearly irrelevant afterthoughts that they've put zero effort into fleshing out are actually characters with depth  a family that i should care about  when commander nhan decided to stay behind, i thought ''ok, who cares?'' the only things i knew about her were things i had learned 5 minutes prior, in that very same episode  but her decision to stay was supposed to carry weight    we're losing a 'member of the crew ' and imagine, we knew more about her than any of the bridge crew and she   wasn't even part of the discovery crew     


and that's the problem for me  there is no crew  there's michael burnham, there's saru (only from the halfway point of season 2  prior to that were   20 episodes with a first officer we knew hardly anything about), and to a lesser extent there are stamets, tilly, and georgiou  but the 'family' that discovery insists exists is a farce  and the insistance that it isn't only makes me want to know more about the bridge crew    to understand them as individuals, to fall in love with them like i have the crews of the various enterprises, ds9, and voyager  and i keep expecting the show to develop the bridge crew's characters  but it never does  and so, for me, season 3 took the fact that the bridge crew are clearly an afterthought from 'annoying' to 'inexcusable'  i don't know that i can watch another 7 or 8 episodes in which rhys smiling or detmer being stressed is considered character development   


am i wrong? i love star trek so much  and i want so badly to love discovery, too  it wasn't so hard when all i had to do was pretend that the spore drive somehow fit with canon, or pretend that the new klingons didn't look a bit silly  but now the show's asking me to pretend that its invested in characters who may as well be nameless  and yet, i see online that the general consensus among fans is that season 3 is incredible  what am i missing? help me love discovery, too ",i so desperately want to love discovery    and its crew  please help

they re all clearly distinctively different and unique, and that s very much art  i just hope for something to come for ds9  

ds9 is a neglected child  tng has most seasons in 1080p with remastered models and updated effects and film, same with tos  i really do think that tos has  significant improvements with the remasters (especially in retrospect when you compare disney and star wars getting so many modifications from the original theatrical release etc) 

who do we need to contact from cbs to get remastered ds9  they must have original film or digital archives! the effects are all something around 480p!?!? this franchise deserves better

yes, vulcan's live longer than humans, but they also exist on a hell world where most non plant species can't afford to wait 20 years for a child to develop enough to survive alone in the wilds if mom dies to a predator  nor can society wait 30 years for a farmer to grow up from a hungry, horny gremlin into a competent worker  basically, the same pressures that forced vulcans to evolve stronger and smarter than humans, also includes a truly terrible puberty that forces them to develop along the same time tables as humans until adult hood where their biology begins to slow down

like probably so many others, i've been using a large chunk of this covid lockdown time to get caught up on tv that i've been meaning to watch for years, and i've finally started on star trek  and do you ever get that feeling that something is just kind of for you, and it has been all along, even if you haven't known it, but now that you're here you're home?

that's how i feel about star trek  i sort of always knew that i would like it, but i wasn't prepared for just how much it would resonate with me  particularly tng  i watched tos and enjoyed quite a lot of it, but tng is like    my show  i'm a completist and would never even consider skipping episodes xd so i've watched it all, and i even love the first two seasons, despite their often hot mess itude! to me, they are fun on their own for what they are and  just make the shift  to greatness in the later seasons even more enjoyable! of course, as someone who wasn't even born when the show started airing and can now just netflix it, it's probably easier to forgive when you know you can just keep watching until it gets better  

it's probably easier for me to forgive a lot of things! for example, i don't totally hate wesley! sure he's a big ol mary sue a lot of the time, but for the most part i find him pretty adorable! for some reason, every episode featuring barclay feels like fanfiction to me, but it's cool! lwaxana troi is an angel and brings some much needed fashion moments to the show! all the opinions about q being the best are 100 percent correct! 

i'm jealous of people who got to experience the show in real time  i can't even imagine how i would have reacted at the end of best of both worlds part 1 back when it first aired  i, a 25 year old woman in 2020, was literally screaming in my apartment as that amazing music cue faded and had to immediately call my star trek loving uncle to scream over the phone to him, but was able to watch the next part right after  had i been a kid watching this show back in the day, i think i would have lost my mind 

anyway, this is all just to say thank you to this community, because i've enjoyed coming here after watching episodes and searching for discussions to see what people had to say, even though i've never participated  it has definitely added a nice dimension to my journey into the world of star trek, which i don't intend to stop anytime soon! i am a bit worried that i'll never love anything as much as i love tng (i just love it so much, help!) but i fully intend to watch it all  i feel like i've entered a new era of my life and everything previous was before trek, and now i've entered my after trek era      too dramatic?! oh well  )",started watching star trek for the first time and   my life may never be the same?

so michael has centred   her way into spock's life and history again with no   believable substance    he is the man he was today because of her  does this ever stop  how is she still taking the credit for everything that makes spock  spock, forget kirk and mccoy  every action, will, wants  and need spock does is because of his older foster sister burnham

geez, it would not surprise me if orci reveals in the reboots that part of the reason spock's is attracted and dates uhura is because uhura has some of the characteristics that reminds him of  michael burnham  orci did write star trek 2009  i see this story line coming if uhura ever shows up in strange new world  

the michael thing needs to stop  its just sad how they inserted her into unification  that were such classic star trek episode  an episode that was more about sarek and spock finding some kind of peace ",michael is responsible for all the good things of mr spock

3831,startrek,"it is the first time i'm watching tng and i have just seen ""the outcast"",  an interesting episode in which riker falls for soren, an androgynous shuttlecraft pilot  even nowadays, with gender affairs being openly debated, i found the episode provocative and well written, despite the cruelty in the last scenes  can you imagine this on tv in 1992?   


as season 5 became more popular every day, many critics raise questions concerning the way the episode depicts an allegory for sexual identity  one issue is that soren identifying herself as a female was not mandatory in the story   in any case, i am trying to look at this episode from another perspective  what struck me the most is how intense the will soren relationship becomes, and this dialogue between will and deanna 

    

w  i met someone   someone who has become important to me  

d  soren 

w  yes  you're my friend i thought    i don't know, i thought i should tell you 

d  i'm glad you did 

w  nothing will change between us, will it? 

d  of course it will  all relationships are constantly changing  but we'll still be friends, maybe better friends  you're a part of my life, and i'm part of yours  that much will always be true 

will smiles and kisses her    
      


imo the message here is that we, as human beings, are mutable  we keep changing the way we identify ourselves, our sexuality, the way we perceive others   therefore, our relationships must be as dynamic as we are  despite all the controversy of the ""conversion therapy"" at the end of the episode, i considered this episode completely underrated  what are your thoughts? do you think will (as an egocentric man) could have really loved soren?",perceptions about the outcast (tng s05 e17) in 2020

3836,startrek,"i agree that worfs relationships to females have always been a bit old fashioned, and his relationship with alexander was always a bit strained, but in tng it was always framed as being because ""this is literally a war ship that is nearly destroyed like every day"" and ""im a klingon and this is just how klingon relationships are""

but on ds9 its entirely different, on ds9 hes just openly hostile and dismissive of his son, and even though at the end of the episode he had a little dad speech and apologized, he still went back to basically going out on an infinite trip to the gas station for space milk and trashing on alexander behind his back whenever he got a chance(even ezri made a comment about this when they were captured together at the end of the series) not to mention after jadzia died he basically attacked julian, and harassed ezri during every one of their encounters just because he was childishly and stubbornly stuck thinking ""i cant date her because shes not jadzia but also literally no one else is ever allowed to date her because she was jadzia, or else shes a whore"" he even called her a slur that was heavily implied to mean something akin to ""slut"" during the previously mentioned episode just because she went on a date with someone who wasnt him even though from ezris point of view, he had been ignoring her and avoiding being rude to her since they first met  maybe something like that could have been played off in early tng as ""hes young and confused and raised outside of his culture and just doesnt understand"" but by this point hes a grown middleaged man with an adult son ",why did ds9 make worf into such an irredeemable dbag?
3837,startrek,"hi! i have never seen star trek  i have only seen parodies from popular culture  from clips that i have seen of the show i guess i never watched it because i was put off by the idea of having some person wearing slightly longer ears and then calling them an alien  when they are almost identical to an average human being  and could in fact be considered human, just with a certain personality  stuff like that seems absurd to me  and so much of science of the show is very likely outdated by now, if it had any science in there, i am sure it had at least some  but recently i have seen discussions that suggest to me that star trek actually tackles many interesting philosophical and moral ideas  i love natural sciences and philosophy and all that, and i was never into star wars, is this show for me?",some opinions please!

3839,startrek,"the latter point happens mostly in tng  it seems natural to see now after seeing it so many times but its still always something i've noticed  there will just be a dip or lull in the conversation and one party will turn 180 degrees and just walk the fuck out  as for the privacy thing, the door locks may as well not exist because basically anyone with the authorization to override them has absolutely no qualms with doing so basically every time they decide to drop in on a friend  being friends with an officer would be so stressful, you could never change clothes or take a bath or whatever without worrying about hearing the door ring twice in 5 seconds (also rude by the way) then just having your boss strut right in like they aren't just trying to catch a peek of some nip(unless you're riker, in which case you have no nipples)  now much of this you could explain away by saying ""well they're all just good friends"" but there's a ton of specific examples of this behavior that just preclude that  like when ezri does it to an (admittedly dead upon her arival) ensign she had met the night before in ds9, or basically the entire beginning of tng ","no one in star trek respects the privacy of anyone else, they also always just walk away abruptly mid conversation "

3850,startrek,"so i ll admit, when i first started, i had a lot of problems  it was hard getting used to the modern settings   well extra super cgi futuristic stuff we can do these days after binging 80 s and 90 s for months  it took some adjusting, but i m beginning to adapt, even though it s not as cozy and i miss the kitsch factor  we will need 50 years for this to be kitsch  

the characters took me a bit to warm up to, that is, the new ones, but once i did i really did  i love their chemistry and everyone is cast so perfectly and diversely!! as always on trek, i m very impressed with the diversity  having seven and picard together in the same show and old tng faves back is magical  i love love love the rikers kid, she s so well cast although she doesn t look anything like her parents but she s great anyway  )

the cinematography is beautiful  space looks very realistic  that borg cube finally looks like the massive implosive and complex threat that it should be    i appreciate seeing old favorite artifacts given their full splendor and potential  

i love the story  i want it to continue  i m hooked on the plot and i will be sad when the last episode that i m on ends in a few minutes  the new season can t come sooner!

3851,startrek,"i'm always glad when i see star trek looking forward into what space flight would be like  wspecially extended space flight  beside artificial gravity and other things they didn't cheap out on how space flight would be achieved  i was watching tng where the get caught in a interstellar boobie trap  they get caught in some form of radiation  somehow it causes their shields to begin decaying  dr  crusher mentions how once the shield goes down the radiation will effect the crew and passengers  all hands will die after 30 minutes of exposure  

although it isnt stated you can imagine the shields were not initially designed for protecting the ships from attack, but more likely interstellar radiation  its a real issue with space flight today, we may not be able to withstand the radiation  once we travel outside the atmosphere nothing is really protecting us anymore  we get hot with so much uv radiation that our cells die off  that is why we are researching so that when we leave it can be for longer than a trip to the moon  of course i dont think the iss is so far outside the farthest layers of our atmosphere that it matter a huge amount 

sorry for the tangent,  it i love how star trek isn't like star wars  you can't just do whatever you want  it still exists in our world of physics and consequence  i appreciate the extent the writers went to to keep the show as practical as possible  especially the original series which came out before we went to tge moon  you get a feeling that you aren't watching a adventure show, rather the procedural life on a research vessel in our galaxy  its amazing! i wish i would have found this show sooner ",well ahead of its time 
3852,startrek,"is it just me or does the crew of the discovery tend to cry all the time? at this point humans are supposed to be scientifically and emotionally woke! i get that they re 900 years into the future and away from all they know and love and feel really emotional, but they tend to cry over every little matter  

instance 1  when michael burnham gets demoted from first officer after knowingly disobeying the captains order to go and rescue book  why does she have to cry? she should ve known the consequences for her actions will have an effect on the image the crew is trying to from with the new federation  

instance 2  when tilly gets assigned as the acting first officer, why does she need to cry and hug michael and make that a whole emotional moment? not denying that she had to face michael regarding the whole  i m taking your post  thing, but crying all the time makes them seem so compromised and vulnerable, when it should be the exact opposite?

the second one seems a bit weak and there s been multiple instance of such unprofessionalism from the crew that i have observed  i am not saying that there shouldn t be a portrait of emotions, because that would just seem lame and inhuman  but can we reel it in with the scenes where crying shouldn t really be a thing from the level of professionalism that is meant to be portrayed  the managerial side of starfleet in the future is so composed and calm and logical

3855,startrek,"don't get me wrong   i liked tasha fine   she was no better or worse than any of the other bland characterizations of secondary characters in the 1st season   but the show was really crowded   too many actors to get pushed to the side, and with tasha gone, you had worf take his rightful place heading security 

think about the original trek  you had two leads (kirk and spock), two secondaries, mccoy and scott, and then 3 or 4 recurring background characters that may or may not get much dialogue at all (sulu, uhura and rand for the 1st season, chekov the 2nd)   that's only 7, with most of them more background than anything else   (note  yes, i know one could argue that mccoy was a lead )

but with tng, they switched to more of an ensemble cast, with 1 lead and 8 secondaries which all had more screen time than than their counterparts on tos   that makes for a very bloated cast in story telling   i'm not a wesley hater, but for the simple reason of space, he should have never been a cast member either   if anything, i would have rather seen tasha at the helm, and dump troi entirely, as she was not necessary to the crew 

in any case, whichever characters are your least favorites, actor bloat meant someone had to go

3859,startrek,i think what the federation should do is build mobile shipyards   huge ships that have dry dock facilities to build smaller ships   and that have the ability to mine fuel and raw materials as they travel through space   that way they could build their ships on the fly   and they could use holograms and robots to build ships faster then humans can   they could send one of these ships to an unexplored region and by the time it got there it could have constructed dozens of ships   that way one ship becomes dozens and even hundreds   the mobile shipyard could even be designed to be extended to build larger ships or other mobile shipyards   so send one of these ships to the edge of the delta quadrant and by the time it got there it could be thousands or tens of thousands of ships   if the federation built a dozen of these they could expand out to every corner of the galaxy   so anyway let me know what you think in the comments ,mobile shipyards

3862,startrek,"i was under the impression that michael's quest to solve the burn was a weird obsession, because albeit an understandable goal, i can't see why it's so urgent that she's breaking all the rules to do it immediately  there is no reason to believe it would change anything in the short term, is it? discussing it with other people, however, it seems some are under the impression that solving it is would possibly (or probably) restore warp travel 

i researched it to the best of my abilities, but i think we're short on details  so a few questions, just to make sure i'm not missing anything 

1) why is warp travel gone?

to my understanding, the only thing stopping it is the lack of dilithium  supply was already dwindling before, and i think it's implied that recrystallization isn't possible on a mass scale, maybe because burned dilithium is useless, so all they have left are the small quantities that survived for whatever reason  fear that dilithium would explode again could stop some people from using it, but it wouldn't stop the whole galaxy 

2) is there any reason to believe finding who or what caused the burn will bring warp back in the short term?

of course, it's tv, so it's possible that everything will be neatly solved in the end, and idk, maybe the bad guys behind the burn know how to fix burned dilithium or have been using alternative tech in secret this whole time  but is there any reason for michael to believe that learning what happened will fix anything immediately? because my impression is that she has this vague notion that if there's a threat behind it all the federation will never be able to safely rebuild, which makes sense but hardly justifies lying and almost quitting starfleet not to delay the search for a week or two  a good idea i just learned from another redditor is that if michael proves the burn was not caused by sb 19 the vulcans romulans could get back to developing an alternative, but that doesn't seem to be michael's plan at all (and even then, it'd be hard to buy that every single person with access to that information, and vulcans no less, would stop studying the galaxy's only hope, something that could fix everything in a year, if it there weren't credible concerns) 

so, is there any way to explain the whole the burn drama except that michael's unreasonably obsessed with it?",what details do we have on warp drive and dillithium on current discovery?

so it looks like 2021 is going to be a more vacant one  but what could we see next?

well lower decks has a second season being produced side by side with the first, so that is the next candidate for release, sometime earlier in the year probably  

we then will likely go into star trek prodigy's first season on nickelodeon in the middle of the year

and that could very well be it  the live action shows have a 1 year turnaround, and as most of them are set to start shooting next year, we can't expect pic s2, snw s1, s31 s1 to be out until 2022 at the earliest  the only other thing we could see in 2021 is disco s4 beginning to air sometime in december, but that seems like it would almost certainly fall back to 2022 also  and lord knows what's up with short treks, for such an acclaimed series with such use, you'd think they would have announced something from it besides ""it'd be interesting to do more""

3877,startrek,"first of all, this is my first post on this sub so i hope i am doing this right   )

so i'm watching ds9 for the first time since a few weeks and when i saw ""looking for par'mach in all the wrong places"" yesterday i noticed that the acting was somehow different  it's a little difficult to explain, but it seemed like all the actors were on a whole new level of liveliness and motivation  be it odo joking about kira's relationship with o'brien, dax while teaching quark how to use a bath'leth or bashir while having a fun little chat with o'brien   something just felt nrw about the way they portrayed their feelings  

after being a little confused at first, i quickly began to love this ""new"" style of acting  don't get me wrong   i loved all of the characters the way they were before, and they don't act completely new in this episode, but it feels like they have    expanded their character traits to make them even better suited as before  and there couldn't have been a better episode than this one to experiment with this new acting style 

did anyone feel the same about this episode when they first saw it, or is it just me? and what do you think could be the reason for this rather interesting ""change""? 

anyway, i'm gonna watch the next episode now to see if this was a unique thing or if they do this regularly from now on   ","the acting in ds9's ""looking for par'mach in all the wrong places"" is    quite interesting "

3880,startrek,"i pretty sure everyone who remembers most of tos noticed that every time when gene touched screenplay it always turned into some kind of ""gladiator"" script  ""bread and circuses"" is the brightest example of that  although i like ""savage curtain"", he wrote a story that puts characters in a situation where they have to fight each other to please some higher power  again 

he did not write ""the gamesters of triskelion"" nor ""arena"", but these episodes got similar story tropes  also, there is an episode about ancient greece like people who are more into ""roman"" types of entertainment (""plato's stepchildren"")  obviously, gene didn't have to be a writer to put his favorite things in the script, because he was the creator, the producer and that was his vision after all  regardless of who writes the story 

i think gene thought that characters and societies that were based on decadent, cruel aspects of ancient rome culture are the perfect antagonists to the starship crew that represents a utopian society like the federation  or maybe he just loved the roman aesthetic, i don't know

so, i'm working on a kelvin timeline personal project, and designing new starships that seem era appropriate, built around the same time as the enterprise

3894,startrek,"now by this i don't mean that i seriously believe that in 400 years we're going to have the enterprise d, that roddenberry was some prophet, or that klingons really are out there  

but, star trek has always been a part of my life  it shaped my morals, it helped to instill into me the values that all life is sacred, to never judge by appearances, that knowledge and strength are useless if not destructive if you've not the respect or discipline to wield them  that what can seem to be a bloodthirsty enemy could just be someone scared, lashing out, and they just need a proper avenue to understand and learn  that protecting the masses means ensuring the smallest of us have all of their rights and dignities intact 

my perfect future would be one akin to what the federation has accomplished  i truly feel the era of a united earth is closer now than ever before, but we must take measures to ensure our equality and fairness  i shudder to think of a world where the replicator has become a commonplace item, but for greedy purposes it is restricted (think about how electric cars have all but been shot in the kneecap because oil companies need their profits)  i base my political decisions and votes on a simple metric  ""will this help to push us down the path of star trek's future?"" 

i don't think star trek is some magical gospel, but i do feel that people pick up their morals from the content they have absorbed over their lifetime (be it sports, human interactions, or television videogames books)  in the end it is not necessarily the work itself but rather what you get out of that work  harry potter for example is a series undergoing a critical self look by the fandom, finding many troublesome things within the work (house elves being ""happy slaves"" just does not sit well for many) but it is indisputable that many people were able to form their morals from the series, morals such as  friendship is worth more than power, love is a stronger force than anyone knows, it is better to die protecting someone than to live only for yourself  

and that's what i keep coming back to  yeah, there are a lot of wacky adventures and somethings that, despite apparently happening 500 years from now, are downright dated  but again and again i find myself looking at this fictional universe and thinking ""how can we bring ourselves to be closer to that?""

3897,startrek,"remember ""star trek into darkness""? khan transported to the klingon home world from earth (alpha to beta quadrant)  if that tech really existed in that time, then why couldn't they build something like that in the 32nd century?

remember those transporters in ""star trek picard""? the ones at starfleet headquarters, where you can simply walk through and then materialize somewhere else  combine the distance of the khan transporter and those ""walk in transporters"", and you have stargates  no need for warp anymore  just walk to another planet in another quadrant, daisy chain those transport hubs and you can go anywhere in the galaxy by walking 100 meters   

the federation can then live on and expand  especially since personal transporters are a thing, probably for short range, but that means that the energy efficiency of transporters is super high in the 32nd century  so maybe they can even build stargates for starships in orbit  again, no need for warp anymore 

the few ships with warp can then position the stargates in orbit of member planets and rebuild the federation 

they really messed up star trek with those ""creative"" ideas about tech  it ruins the plots ","why don't they use the transporter of ""star trek into darkness"" to transport to different planets in the 32nd century?"

3902,startrek,"i'm rewatching from where i left off in the 90s  season 3 

what's interesting is that i can say that this is a totally ""cw"" show  even enterprise was more ""berman"" than this  this is weirdly, totally ""cw"" 

i've seen all of tng and ds9 and as a pair they are core trek  ds9 is, at its peak, peak trek  i never saw season 3, but i've watch 1 amp 2 and a few episodes of ""4"" (tas) and all of ""5"" (stc) of tos  

i consider the tos films to be core, the tng films to be in that realm of ""meh, okay, lame, but meh"" category of 90s films which the brosnan bonds occupy 

jj trek is alright, but very different  cbs trek, all the way around, is garbage  for bad world building, bad plot, weird acting, awful writing, cheap sets 

but voyager? honestly, it went on so long, and is so very different  it ""looks"" like tng ds9 trek  as i said, enterprise had bits of its ""90s tv"" style, but enterprise was more berman esque, mostly in the vein of the tng films  the fourth season was very good and focused almost into the ds9 realm 

voyager?

this is, as i said, cw trek 

but i love it 

it takes cheap, cheezy, pedestrian character drama that the other treks in spite of themselves did not have, and elevates it  it takes ""cw"" and elevates it to a very respectful ""star trek"" level of style, lore and form  it therefore produces almost like an enlightened version of what you'd see in ""xena warrior princess""  it's schlocky, but sincere, intellectual, and worships the legacy of star trek 

it's not ds9 or tng  it's its own thing  but somehow it's just really great in its own way  it's proof that trek can elevate things 

it proves why cbs trek is so bad, because it belittles and lowers trek (when trek should automatically lift up genres, styles and properties) ",praise to voyager

3904,startrek,"i just watched ds9  a man alone  in the episode, a man kills a clone that he made of himself  it is stated that this makes him a murderer  parallel bashir ended up creating another clone because plot reasons, and at the end of the episode, they mentioned that this clone went off to start a new life for himself 

so the takeaway is  it's ok to clone people   no need to ask for permission, and killing clones is no different from killing people 

but then i remembered an episode of tng  up the long ladder  as i recall (it's been a while since i've seen it), dna is taken from riker and polaski without their permission to make clones  when this is discovered, riker destroys the clones  riker faces no repercussions for this action, and nobody suggests there was anything wrong with it

to be perfectly clear, i ve seen my favorite episodes dozens of times each, and every episode at least once, but even with my favorite shows i don t do a complete series overhaul very often  about three months ago i decided it was time to go through tng as a whole once more  it reinvigorated my love of it all right  oh, i ve always remained steadfast in my love of it sure, but it can be another thing entirely to remain  passionate  after a certain amount of time away has elapsed  the biggest takeaways were how much two episodes in particular grew on me  the defector and frame of mind  i think because on my first watch through as a teen i never quite liked the romulan centric stories as much as klingon or even cardassian ones ( they re just unreasonable vulcans  i might have said), and an episode like frame of mind was too out there for me back then i think  but they rose quite a bit in my esteem this time around

   the main cast are all incredible    yes the show is very much centered around smg but she does an amazing job  her speech in the latest episode easily rivals classic trek speeches  the rest of the cast is great too  michel yeoh steals every scene she's in  her and sonequa martin green's scenes are always great  doug jones has vaulted into the pantheon of trek captains in only a handful of episodes  i love how saru is starfleet through and through while having a completly different style from any previous captain    


    every episode this season has been a banger    every one has been a classic   30 min trek episode with the burn as an intriguing b plot  the seed vault and the ni'var episodes are easily top 50 trek episodes  getting a deep dive in to barzan culture was refreshing given how many trek races are so one note  the misunderstood monster is a classic trek plot that was done really well  watching that man suffer was legitimately heartbreaking  this latest episode was just a classic lawyer trek episode  it examined the consequence of a previous trek series without being overly fan servicy  

   the representation is awesome    its just awesome and is something trek should've done ages ago  

    the ships and uniforms are awesome    when i first watched discovery i hated the uniforms and the angular ships but now i really like them  the 31st century uniforms are similarly awesome and both compete with the tng movies lateds9 uniforms for my favorite

1    micheal burnham and cleveland booker  

   a black man (booker) and black woman (burnham), and not one of the
   problems or challenges they face as people or as a couple is
   because they are black 

   just as important  there is no hint that their phenotypes could be
   the cause of a problem or challenge  (it doesn t hurt that neither
    book  nor burnham have, so far, been saddled with any  blackness
   as character marker  tropes  at least so far as my not american and
   english is not my first languge head has spotted )

   want me to believe in a little bit utopian imagined star trek
   future? this is absolutely one of the necessary things, for me 
   because, without black people (and not white people in general)
   living as  just people  being utterly normal, i m not going to buy
   your imagined better future 

   futures made up only of people who all look
   northern european descended aren t utopias, they are the aftermaths
   of genocide 

   put another away, sf has to normalise black people (and not white
   people, more generally) living as unhyphenated humans  black people
   not being defined as  african american people , or as  black
   people   rather, they are  people , living with the same
   opportunities, and the same constraints, and the same hopes, and
   the same fears, as every other person 

   this is not the same thing as so called  colour blind  writing,
   which tends to turn everyone in to  generic white  

   differences don t go away, they just stop acting as limitations, or
   barriers, or character markers 

   that latter point is a big one, btw   sassy black woman , for
   example, is not a character marker  it s a racist trope that hides
   the trauma and exhausted and constant defence of self underlying
   the actual behaviours the trope appropriates 

2    adira tal   and   gray tal  

   a woman (adira) and a man (gray) in a mixed gender queer
   relationship, and the mixed gender aspect isn t used to argue the
   pair are  actually  or  basically  straight 

   bisexual folk make up about 50  of all gsm folk  and about 80  of
   bisexual people are in mixed gender relationships 

   my own, bisexual centric, friends and family, circle, has a higher
   percentage of bisexual folk in same gender relationships than the
   world wide average  but there are still multiple mixed gender queer
   relationships in my circle  and their being mixed gender doesn t
   make them less queer 

   a  lot  of queer relationships are mixed gender  but narratives
   that manage to acknowledge this, let alone actively show this, are
   not exactly common 

   so, even though this particular relationship is full of sfnal
   tropery (gray isn t human  and now he s dead and only visible to
   adira), i ll take this one as a start  better than nothing  because
   nothing is, all too often, the only alternative on offer 

   it helps that both of them are cute as hell and manage to show
    young love  without being over the top with the adolescent drama
   (not because over the top adolescent drama is a bad thing, per se,
   but because it makes this particular representation all the more
   positive and delightful to watch) ","two relationships i particularly like in  star trek  discovery , season 3"

3926,startrek,,when an unauthorized officer is in your captain's chair but they're too cute to remove  now i know how picard felt with handling wesley    
3927,startrek,"  preface 

i love, love, love ds9 as it was written and produced  these thoughts are not meant to disparage the show at all  it's simply musings about what else could have been 

avery brooks played a great commander and captain  the nuance he brought to the character was amazing 

i am well aware that cmdr  riker wanted the enterprise  i also feel that, of all the characters on tng, his character development was done the least   not to say it wasn't done at all  but i think his character would have really blossomed on ds9  with that, we'll begin the musings 

  riker's charisma and back alley persona

for the developments that did happen with cmdr  riker, we got to see just slight glimpses of the wheeling and dealing that he could do  we also got to witness how intimidating he can get  on a few different occasions  ( we've also seen how he had rapport with quark  he's also shown how he can play dirty   and this would have all been effective at ds9 

cmdr  sisko embodies a lot of those qualities, especially later on  and i think cmdr  riker being driven to some desperation would have been a great evolution of his character  i could absolutely see riker truly losing it and saying, ""major! shut that thing off!"" as an example  riker needing to tap into that side of his would have been instrumental during the dominion war, and he would have had ample time to consider or regret what he was becoming 

  getting cmdr  riker to relinquish the enterprise via writing

as i had mentioned in the preface, cmdr  riker was adamant about having command of the enterprise  it was a taste that was difficult to dismiss when he had command on a few occasions, particularly when they engaged the borg  so the opening of deep space nine would have needed to have the wormhole already recently discovered by the time the first episode lands, and the outpost seeking a capable commander  enter william t  riker 

  the enticing dynamics between riker and the other ds9 characters

i think the only real dynamic that may be sacrificed in this scenario is the one between jadzia and benjamin  one of my favorite utterances throughout ds9 is the use of, ""old man "" outside of that, i could absolutely see riker and every character aboard ds9 having a great dynamic, and still be very similar to how sisko's dynamics worked out  many ideas pop into mind here 

  the arrival of worf

i could imagine how much the trek fandom freaked out when worf returned to star trek  i wasn't connected with them at the time, but seeing him appear made me scream out of excitement as a kid  i think the dynamic between riker and worf was already fantastic (""besides    you look good in a dress "")  the further deepening of the dynamic would have been great for both of them 

i can think of many other points, but i'll save them from this already huge wall of text  i'll let you all ponder it, too ",i wonder often about what would have happened if cmdr  riker was written to command ds9  some sunday musings

3932,startrek,"so with the trill, the hosts almost seem like a serf race, entirely dedicated to serving the symbionts   the hosts have joining as their ultimate purpose, the ultimate sort of fulfillment they can achieve, and many of them dedicate themselves entirely to receiving a symbionts  but there's so many more hosts than symbionts that you end up with scores of people who spent decades planning to be joined, only to be denied, sometimes for seemingly arbitrary reasons 

i mean, we had an entire episode in ds9 where a trill held the crew hostage because he had spent his entire life hoping to be joined, only to have his expectations dashed, and simply didn't know what else to do  the selection process doesn't seem good, either  in the episode with jadzia and her initiate, sisko goes so far as to call curzon 'abusive' with initiates   he had a reputation for crushing potential hosts 

it's an inherent imbalance   you have   masses   of people striving for an opportunity which there simply isn't enough of to sate them all, but worse still, their culture revolves around that opportunity  they are cruel and harsh to people who seek it out, and the vast majority of people who try (and work for it!) have their dreams dashed to pieces   to say nothing of the fact that the hosts just seem to serve as a subservient, caretaker race in general ","trill power dynamics seem    predatory, to say the least"

3944,startrek,"there's no introductory series  

something that annoyed me about tng that in retrospect was very smart, is that roddenberry made it so there were only limited references to the original series  just enough to establish that they are in the same universe but not enough for you to need to have watched tos to understand tng  

this annoyed me because i wanted to know more about the galactic barrier, the guardian of forever,  the organians etc  but it was the best to introduce younger fans to whom the 60s show was too passe  

this is not the case for the modern shows, discovery, picard and especially lower decks assume you've watched the previous tv shows or are at least familiar with the world  it's an issue because this era of star trek doesn't stand on its own  

i could argue that season 3 of discovery is the first season of any show that could apparently stand on its own, but the more it goes on the more it seems that you would need to at least watch season 2 to fully get what's going on  the season that assumed that you've watched the menagerie and that you are familiar with spock and (to a lesser extent) captain pike ",a real issue with modern star trek that no one brings up

3953,startrek,"i've been taking my so through enterprise for the first time (i hadn't watched it in a few years) and we arrived at the episode 'future tense'  briefly, the enterprise discovers a ship from more than 900 years in the future derelict in space (approx  100 years prior to the events of disco season 3)  the episode got me thinking about disco 

 spoilers for the enterprise episode, if anyone hasn't watched it  

what we see of the ship, and obviously it's just one ship, makes me question the premise of disco's season 3 more than i already have been  if the ship had any semblance of a warp core or dilithium, trip and company would have easily identified it and not been mystified with the ship's various components, both organic and otherwise, since the basic components of a warp engine wouldn't be dissimilar from that of enterprise's  the ship and its construction also demonstrated a mastery of spatial geometry and folded dimensions within a compact space (a la the tardis in doctor who)  this suggests technology far beyond that of what we've seen in disco season 3 

and yes, i'm aware of the argument that the burn set technology back because of its destructive power, but it's not as if the burn actively eradicated entire civilisations  the technology and power utilisation we see in future tense is completely alien to the crew of the enterprise even if the sole occupant of the ship is a human (with a bunch of other genetic bits mixed in)  and yes, i'm also aware of the argument that the ban on time travel technology might mean the end of using anything remotely close to time travel, but that doesn't negate the use of something beyond just matter, antimatter, and dilithium to power a ship  

and of course, what we don't know about the details of that ship could fill a universe in itself, as well as the time between that vehicle's commission (900 years in the future, so the ship's actual home year would be 900   x) and the events of disco season 3, but the disconnect in technological utilisation is disconcerting on a logical level  clearly the 31st century had great understandings of both space and time (and quantum physics, as an extension), so why in the world would they still be using standard warp drive?",enterprise's episode 'future tense' and disco season 3

1  i would find the plans for as many federation and alien warships as i could   i would reverse engineer them and come up with new ship designs based on their technology   but not exactly the same ship   that way the federation and the other factions don't hunt me down   i would also reverse engineer romulan cloaking technology   so that civilians could build their own cloaked warships 
2  i would design holograms and robots specifically for ship building   so you would have a cheap labor force who could build ships way better then humans can 
3  i would release the plans for the new warships on subspace to anyone who wants them   and include holograms that can help with ship design and construction 
4   i would watch as civilians build warships and take back their planets from oppressive regimes   can you imagine civilians flying around in something the equivalent of a defiant or galaxy class ship    or even better the scimitar from nemisis   considering that most materials used in ship construction can be replicated the only real limitation to how many ships you could build would be energy   and that is pretty abundant in space   with a lot of civilians now owning their own warships establishing a dictatorship would be near impossible   so that would level the playing field 

so that is how i would end oppression in star trek   it worked pretty well for the terran resistance   mirror o'brian stole the plans for the defiant and built another one   and used it to defeat the alliance   i say give everyone the information they need to build their own warships and the galaxy would be a much freer place   let me know what you think in the comments ",how i would end tyranny in star trek

3962,startrek,"first, i will say i have much love and admiration for all the engineers we have seen in trek  there isn't a one who doesn't inspire at least a little awe when it comes to their technical expertise  but there is one that sails head and shoulders above the rest, and that is geordi laforge  allow me to explain 

1  he is a graduate of starfleet academy and the corps of engineers  geordi comes to us a fresh faced lieutenant junior grade assigned to the federation flagship  this we all know is no easy task and we learn later this is because he impressed captain picard years earlier as an ensign with his tenacity and ingenuity fixing a problem  so right away, we know he is trained and he has mad skills  
2  geordi takes over engineering in one year  he goes from piloting the ship to in charge of the whole engineering department  his work is so impressive that we watch him get not one but two promotions from lieutenant to lt  cmdr  and ultimately commander all in seven years  this is a pace unheard of and unseen anywhere else in trek  geordi is so skilled they can't help but promote him over and over  
3  geordi is one of a very select few people who understands and can work on positronics  this is shown throughout his entire working relationship with data  when maddox first attempts to get his hands on data for study, data quits starfleet rather than submit to any testing  this is a hesitancy he never shows with geordi, proving geordi has a better working knowledge and obviously the trust of data, to do the work  geordi helps data install his emotion chip  geordi helps with data's dream program  geordi helps program b4   countless times geordi is tasked with understanding what is going on with data and finding ways to fix him or bring him back up to snuff  no one else ever shows that level of knowledge or comfortability  
4  there is no technology geordi ever encounters that he cannot understand or make work  as chief engineer of the federation flagship, we know the crew comes into contact with more alien species than any other  countless times geordi's skills are utilized to make the alien technology work, or make starfleet tech work better  from the pakleds, the iconians, the aldeans, the borg, cytherians, romulans, klingons, etc   a whole host of technologies encountered by the enterprise and dependent on laforge's ability to understand it and make it work, or understand it and overcome overpower it  
5  geordi knows more than scotty  now, before you all start screaming, please pay attention  scotty is a great engineer, and we have seen him pull off incredible feats, but those were almost exclusively based off federation technology only  rarely was he required to actually work with or understand alien tech  in most cases, anything alien was treated as hostile and scotty's job was simply to overpower destroy it  this does not require investigating beyond what something is made of and if the phasers can blast through it  scotty was great at saving the enterprise, and making its systems function, but he was bad when it came to alien tech  he didn't show much range with it until much later in his career  by virtue of just being born and trained later, geordi knows more  he is the most qualified engineer that we have seen to date (all others are his contemporaries so their knowledge base would be essentially the same)  not to mention that when scotty and geordi did work together, geordi was able to put his knowledge to work and quickly, often outpacing scotty and making him nostalgic for his glory days  again, scotty is a great engineer, but geordi will always have this leg up on him in this regard  
6  geordi taught miles o'brien everything he knows  keep in mind, o'brien was apart of geordi's staff on the enterprise for at least 6 years  that meant it was geordi's job to train him and hone his skills, which he did ably otherwise o'brien never would have been promoted to chief and made it to ds9  also, as an actual officer, geordi's training would have been way more intensive and extensive, there putting him above o'brien  we know that o'brien goes on to be a great engineer, but he definitely owes alot of his career success to working with geordi on the enterprise  

in conclusion, there is no more talented, versatile, innovative, or overly qualified engineer we ever see in starfleet to date  geordi's ability to work with anyone and anything makes him uniquely suited to be in deep space, and obviously in charge of engineering on the federation flagship  he is a dedicated scientist and researcher, investigator, and determined to make sure his department is always performing at its best  there is no other engineer we ever watch who surpasses his skill set, though they each have qualities that still make them great in their own right  but, geordi laforge is the best and this is the hill i will die on ",the hill i will die on    geordi laforge is the best engineer!

i liked the change he brought by being truly ruthless  amp  embracing evil to achieve ones goals  that for him, the goal justifies the means  a stark contrast to most idealistic captains we ve had before  i m not saying he is perfect, but it made an interesting change to what we are used to  i was disappointed that they had to switch him as we could have seen an interesting character arc about redemption, embrace or perhaps the toil of war

3986,startrek,"this is re posted after the original title was deemed to specific and spoiler y  sorry for before, i thought i was vague enough  hopefully this new title is good, but if not i won't try to re post it again  i was surprised to see how hated suru's decision was too, i expected it to be pretty controversial 

 

now that you've accepted the consequences of clicking on a ""spoiler"" tag for the latest episode, i'll elaborate fully 

a lot of people are angry about tilly's promotion to (temporary) first officer  and there are certainly reasons to be skeptical  however, everyone seems to be focused on the massive rank jump  i sorta agree here, but given all tilly has been through i don't think it's unreasonable in that kinda ""never in the real world but it's ok for a show"" kinda way  the same way ensign crusher, lt nog, and maybe even a good chunk of the maquis in voyager are fine 

my problem is that suru just made the same mistake he made with burnham  let me explain 

last episode (or was it 2 episodes ago, i don't remember), suru demoted michel for all the right reasons  but importantly, he said something to the effect of ""in you're defense, i cannot place all the blame on you  you were very vocal on your indifference and reservation to the assignment, yet i insisted "" he then goes on about how he did so to keep some sense of familiarity or something like that but that's less important  it's this very defense that convinced me she didn't deserve to be dismissed from starfleet altogether 

then enters ensign tilly  i don't doubt an ensign could be a good first officer  nor do i doubt tilly could be a great  1, or even captain, one day  however one of the first things tilly says when offered the position is (paraphrasing) ""but sir, i'm an ensign  i would be in charge of    lives       !     i've never been in a command position of any kind before "" one of the first things tilly does is express serious concern for her ability to cope with the pressure and weight of the responsibility in a crisis  and rightfully so  even a skilled officer would feel the weight of that if they saw it coming  this is probably a large part of why suru gives her a day to think 

however it's worth noting that tilly herself doesn't seem to think she is ready  and more then anybody, she should know how she would react under that kind of stress right now  but does she decide she is ready? does she go ""ok, that was sudden and caught me off guard but i can do this ""? no, she only accepts after all her friends tell her, without hearing her out, ""take the job""  basically peer pressuring her into it  to me in that scene she always looked concerned and unready for the responsibility, until the sr 18(?) data distracted her 

discovery isn't the cerritos either  if it were just ""some ship"" i would let it slide  discovery is the single most important starship in the entire known galaxy! it is reserved specifically to jump immediately into only the most desperate, hostile, and critical situations, as explicitly layed out by the admiral  tilly doesn't have the luxury of trying the seat out, taking it easy on some trial missions, and deferring to suru if need be  she will almost certainly be directly responsible for not just the lives of her crew, but the spore drive and by extension the future of the entire federation itself  and she doesn't think she's ready for it 

suru has again chosen someone how does not think they are right for the job, again through a sense of familiarity  do you know what a good solution would be? getting a permanent replacement now from the admiral instead of doing it latter  heck even picking a permanent  1 from discovery's own crew now, or even a temporary one from the admiral (i should really learn his name)  someone confident, with experience, and reliable 

even narratively, it feels like they are setting up for a ""tilly isn't ready and gets people killed"" episode to me  logically this seems makes sense too 

if you support suru's decision i would love to hear a solid defense to this argument  i want to like everything about all the shows i watch (that would just make them better after all), and fan communities are great at fixing little errors and problems like this ","discovery 307  it isn't the experience that bothers me about ""that decision""  it's the personnel involved"

3995,startrek,""" mendez  mister spock, you're aware of the orders regarding any contact with talos four  you have deliberately invited the death penalty  you've not only finished yourself, spock, but you've finished your captain as well   
spock  the commodore must be aware that captain kirk knew nothing of this   
mendez  and you're aware a captain is responsible for everything that occurs on his ship  i order you to return this vessel back to manual control

mendez  very well  you've earned the consequences  this court is in recess

kirk  do you know what you're doing? have you lost your mind?  
spock  captain, jim, please don't stop me  don't let him stop me  it's your career and captain pike's life  you must see the rest of the transmission   
kirk  lock him up  "" from the script of the menagerie

so the captain is responsible for everything that happens on his ship   that's weird   i can understand if mr  sulu accidently crashed the enterprise into a moon while captain kirk was asleep in his quarters  that kirk would be responsible he is after all the captain of the ship   he is the one who puts sulu in that position and is the one who keeps him there   that makes some sense   but to say he is responsible for each crew members private criminal conduct is bizarre   even the us navy in real life isn't that strict 

but my post is primarily about starfleet making up weird rules on the fly   when did they invent this one?  yesterday?  last week when ben finney faked his death, sabotaged the ship, and almost killed a group of captains no one tried to blame kirk for it  

you see it throughout the franchise janeway telling kim ""no, sex with aliens"" wait, when is that a rule? tuvok ""no, religious jewelry "" have you met mr  worf? etc

3997,startrek,"seen a fair bit of reactions about how her new promotion breaks the chain of command, how she lacks the seniority, experience, rank, etc 

but look how the crew reacts 

the most negative reaction we saw was that a very senior officer would find it weird 

otherwise, the crew endorses saru s decision, and celebrates tilly s promotion 

no jealousy  no sniping  no one feeling snubbed 

saru made a decision  everyone accepted it, because they accept his leadership 

this is a culture that doesn t put hierarchy before people and celebrates another s success, rather than taking it as a slight against them
