0,startrek,the pd might be a starfleet regulation but im sure the federation would have some equivalent civilian law and wouldnt just stand by and allow it to happen
1,startrek,thenseems like the system is working isnt it  why fix what isnt brokenalso keep in mind we dont necessarily get to see the times when breaking the pd was the *wrong* thing to do because that makes for bad tv so our sample set is inherently biased to endorse pd violations
2,startrek,probably in some far-flung future its not really relevant to the current topic
3,startrek,definitely i think what made it so good was how relatable it was to be a trouble making kid who adults think will never amount to anything
4,startrek,out of the series and episodes ive watched the only time ive genuinely thought oh shit at being outgunned is when the baul ships show up it was unexpectedotherwise it doesnt tend to matter too much they can talk their way out of it most of the time there needs to be a ship for the next episode
5,startrek,/rbrandnewsentence
6,startrek,theyre in a dark age though so it should portray it as ~dark~ at the very least its roughly a generation or two following a galactic calamity in the same episode the scientist talking to stamets says something about the 23rd century being better for scientific discovery - not the exact words i cant remember
7,startrek,morality isnt static  whether someones actions were justified or not depends on the situation  starfleet captains frequently violate the prime directive anyway  some of them more so then others  and they dont get punished for it  and then some of them sit by and watch entire planets get wiped out becasue they are following the prime directive  if there were exceptions in the case of planetary disasters they could interfere without worrying about a court martial  so starfleet already evaluates their peoples actions based on the circumstances
8,startrek,was that good or bad
9,startrek,&gt;also how is sukal 120 odd years old side effects of the subspace radiationhes transkelpien as in transhuman ie more than human usually in settings that have attained the technological singularity spliced w/ dilithium &amp; subspace boogaloo stuff on cellular level from birth who is to say what is normal in his specific case considering the untreaded territory
10,startrek,i started filling out the questionnaire but stopped as i didnt find answers that felt reflective of my experience is this survey specifically for super fans i recognize there are a few places to indicate no/none; however the second from the last question does not give someone an option to indicate they dont express their fandom anywhere online or in personfrom here im going to provide unsolicited advice feel free to skip it if youre not interested as a preface i genuinely believe all students should engage in the research process at some point in their study i think what youre doing is an incredible first step in learning about the data collection process i spent three years working in a research lab and my advisors were specifically focused on creating and evaluating reliable and valid methods of assessment so my perspective is heavily filtered through that lenswith that said i see that this is for an undergraduate study and i imagine an advisor is working with you on your research im curious if you are working with a co-advisor in the psych departmentare you doing a qualitative quantitative or mixed methods study if youre doing a mixed methods or quant study it would be helpful to have a doc student or prof in the psych department look over the questionnaire and provide some suggestions for how to improve reliability and validity of the measure while i understand youre an undergrad student and the expectations will be different i think its incredibly important at all stages of study to at least attempt to address reliability and validity of assessment measures or be aware of how reliable or valid your measures are too often both in research and in life we create data measures that are biased and leading that ultimately serve to validate our beliefs about the topic were attempting to study even if you dont make changes to your survey it would be helpful to know to what degree it is a reliable and valid measure of your questions if youre running a mostly qualitative study and reflecting on individual responses nothing would really need to change if youre attempting to draw conclusions about fandom and run any sort of quantitative analysis of your results id strongly recommend addressing the reliability and validity
11,startrek,i think the acting is pretty typically *trek* acting: a small amount is very good for me that is tilly and saru but tilly first; vance is also great and mirror giorgiou was some *very* deft handling by michelle yeoh trying to make rat-on-meth scenery chewing believable most of it is pretty serviceable and some of it is downright bad and a lot of it--across the good-to-bad spectrum--is scenery-chewing which has been a staple of *trek* since tos and i think tends to be more of a directorial thing
12,startrek,i’ve learned to ignore the online hate about pretty much any trek there’s this whole circlejerk of people who live to quip about bad writing and bad acting as far as i’m concerned they’re a bunch of smug neckbeards who know fuckall about writing and acting period i frankly believe that the acting quality in discovery is on par with what i’ve seen in a lot of contemporary series and in a lot of ways superior i cite doug jones as exhibit a the man is a walking talking masterclass on acting if i had to accuse anyone of overacting i’d accuse sonequa but that’s more of a casual observation than a critique because i still love what she brings to the character i can’t think of any other cast member whose acting takes me out of the moment the chemistry of the bridge crew gets better literally every episode and i love seeing it mary has arguably the most complex character in the whole show and she absolutely dominates it these folks are clearly having fun they’re young and get to partake in one of the most celebrated franchises in tv history and you don’t get to do that being a shit actor the online haters can keep circlejerking; i choose to have fun with the cast
13,startrek,that all sounds great on paper but the problem is who gets to decide what an acceptable exception isthe problem with moral subjectivity is that its subjective :p
14,startrek,super fan
15,startrek,tos establishes the mindset and the ethical standpoint more than the others  but that may matter less  go with what grabs you
16,startrek,deleted
17,startrek,age has to be weighted and tos is still the best
18,startrek,except that they didnt there were still kazon in the area more were on the way they were heavily damaged and had no idea how complex it actually would be to use the array without the caretaker
19,startrek,fair enough
20,startrek,1 tng2 tos3 voy4 ds95 pic6 dsc7 entnot including tas and lower decks
21,startrek,sure but part of my original confusion was that the federation starships are often outgunned by *known* threats it felt a bit like running a police force in a war zone and arming them with nothing but pepper spray there have been some good points made about ships purposes and the fact that in the beginning of tng and even ds9 there wasnt as much of a need for dedicated warships though
22,startrek,i really dont like disco very much but theres nothing really wrong with the acting even my least favorite character georgiou is not poorly acted- shes told to chew the scenery and she does sopooossibly people refer to some of burnhams drama scenes or tillys this is the power of math people-moments because those are cringey af but i dont think its because of the actingthe best thing about disco is its lgbt representation so yeah got nothing left for people who complain about that
23,startrek,bad pr they had bad pr when kirk was demoted from admiral back captain for saving earth from the whale probe  starfleet instead promotes janeway to admiral for getting her ship and crew lost in the delta quadrant for 7 years they shouldve kept her as a captain not promote her
24,startrek,lol maybe dunno ive only just started watching tng going chronological :p
25,startrek,to be fair he is far from the bones of his people/s
26,startrek,42
27,startrek,a heel turn seems like the perfect thing to happen as a season finale
28,startrek,is enterprise
29,startrek,then it’s some bad people who wrote the review
30,startrek,they probably wanted to see if they could get him to go crazy and try to kill all human life since almost literally every single form of synthetic life has tried to do this at least once in any star trek serieswhich honestly is such a shitty trope to come up so consistently in a series about strange new life
31,startrek,tos is the only true trek
32,startrek,while youre not wrong i think there are some very stark distinctions between pre- and post-2005 trek even if were not including the abrams movies which were extremely divisive in how far off the roddenberry template they strayed discovery and picard are really fundamentally different from enterprise and earlier the darker tones the shorter seasons which are more a mini-series than stand-alone episodes the lack of ensemble casts who all get their own starring roles from time to time and the allegorical and philosophical themes taking a backseat to complex drawn out plotting sure ds9 started in that direction but all those shows were fundamentally similar the modern shows take place in the same universe but do not feel like the same franchise the one exception being lower decks although im only a few episodes into that one and i dont know much about the upcoming shows but i cant imagine they will be particularly regressive either
33,startrek,vic singing was emotionally resonating with the characters in the show us sharing the experience of hearing a song with the chapters only furthers our connection to them at least that’s how i see it
34,startrek,true the kazon also make considerable efforts to acquire the voyagers superior technology i should have worded it differently its not that the federation is always outgunned but theyre frequently outgunned by known threats
35,startrek,i’d say that nog has the best arc in all of *star trek*
36,startrek,&gt;appendix b should be picard negotiating for cloaked warbirds i tried the link just now and it seems to work for meyou are right sorry -- it must have been me mis-tapping repeatedly on the phonethe scene resolved very simplistically though -- its just picard threatening the klingons to have the federation favour the romulans instead which seems a little bit above picards station if you really ask methe other scenes was you said are all masterpieces of especially those from the wounded my are not really negotiation scene they are dramatic high-stakes conversations with stellar acting and believable motives but do not s hi iw two parties work together to reach a compromise
37,startrek,whatever it was that scotty was drinking
38,startrek,1 i think a lot of us wanted this and they are also realizing it with season 3 where some characters get more screen time although still not enough i do respect what they were trying to do with having a main character which isnt a captain but i dont think they delivered it well which is why there are many criticisms on michael 2-3 i think you enjoy episodic trek like tos than serial trek disco there are ways they could have achieved this eitherway but because they try to push forth more action more drama problems that are so big that everything is urgent all that ends up taking up most of the time and they cant do actual exploration exploration is one of the top things i liked about trek so it was a bit of a let down but this is something theyve established since season 1 that disco would be about action and conflict and not really uhh discovery4 disco is progressive in the lgbtq sense although it is very in your face i wish they wrote that better but i guess its better than nothing i get why they have to bring up federation values because it was a time of war the easiest way to win the war is not the federation way and you could see it when they had to utilize mines in season 2 even if it was forbidden but yes i do wish they reduced the speeches show more and tell less5 i get that disco would have some leeway because its an exploratory vessel but michael did get away with a lot this is mostly because it is written such that although she disregards orders her actions will lead to good and success some plot armor that she needs because shes a non-captain main lead not defending it because if they wrote things differently she wouldnt even need plot armor at all6 they were inclusive in casting but yes they were not able to fully showcase all the cast as with #1 they broke off from an ensemble setting and now they cant pull back without it being too sudden or break away from the action packed episodes7 yeah that would be tough with disco the seasons are just solving one big problem and they take you to an action packed ride to the end i enjoy it as a scifi show where i just generally turn off my brain and watch 8 for the time jump i think they were forced to do it because they had to follow the original series and original series spock does not have a sister this is easily avoided of course if they just wrote michael differently even just a minor change to her background and who adopts her for the mirror timeline i found it fun certainly an interesting twist in season 1 but when they did it again on season 3 it was still fun but its jarring because it deviated from the burn plot9  this would be fun but i guess because disco is serial they cant do this it would put a sudden stop to all he action and drama theyre trying to build up every episode10 true disco not only has the spore drive but also has the sentient planet thing whatever and truly there were no efforts to replicate the tardigrade dna for the other star ships cause discovery needs to be special~ spore drive is interesting though but it seems unlikely that there arent any downsides to it something that sounds too good to be true
39,startrek,she forced 7of9 to leave the borgshe killed tuvixshe changed the past/future
40,startrek,in a way your viewership is the transaction its like voting if you dont watch it then you dont really get a say in how it should go i mean express your opinion all you want if the conversation is about enterprise and you chose not to watch it then really what are you about criticism or progress
41,startrek,he was very charming so i did not mind
42,startrek,quark got away with crimes that should’ve led to imprisonment so the way justice worked for him in *ds9* was even more mysterious
43,startrek,their photon torpedos come with a standard issue timer they couldve just beamed a few of them aboardor not wait till the last second before making a decision they had ample time to make arrangements before the kazon showed up in force
44,startrek,well going with an in universe speculation species like the romulans klingons seem to build their ships with warin mind war-birds and bird-of-preys being warships so it stands that their gonna be armed to the teeth with their power systems configured to provide the weapons the most amount of power and be optimized for a combat role id they also have non-dedicated warships but its unlikely they are going to be sent into combatnow the federation seems to make a multipurpose design to ship building atleast before the dominion war they make their ships where they can fit combat exploration research and so on packed in one ship then optimize the ships systems based on what the ships primary task is going to be the perks are you have a fleet of ships that can fight in a combat zone one day and respond to a planet wide disaster the next the downside is a multitool ship will usually be outperformed by a ship specifically designed equipped and optimized for combat
45,startrek,i just enjoy the idea of people gatekeeping mr rogers neighborhood they watch an episode of daniel tiger and immediately congregate online to criticize the writing as juvenile and complain  thats not real mr rogers
46,startrek,in seasons 1 and 2 id say 30%-40%
47,startrek,they arent the terran empire  they dont have the right to stop member planets from seceding
48,startrek,&gt;and my point is that if you love star trek you support itwhat did i sign a legally binding contract
49,startrek,and there was both -- some was legit some was just bitching  \*shrug\*
50,startrek,i forgot cobra kai thats a good example
51,startrek,the writing the role models the hope the humor
52,startrek,greta gerwig because i want to see what someone from the other 52% of humanity would do with it
53,startrek,the actor is an actual bona fide pop singer so why not use him
54,startrek,what % of tng storylines involve wesley saving the day
55,startrek,true but youre also comparing two very different viewing environments direct app service is much different then cable broadcast dsc is doing well because sts fan base is huge enough to support it cable ratings arent as important as they used to be i remember the voices during enterprise all criticizing the intro music i still like it tpol for being hot  it being a prequel series to be contemporary to star wars eos 1-3it was all just a bunch of fans being rabid because they could
56,startrek,im just wondering where the calypso discovery is is that still canon because it was really good
57,startrek,self replicating mines perpetual machines right there why they dont use that technology to mine the whole gamma quadrant is beyond me
58,startrek,i remember learning that he used to perform shakespeare in yiddish and i was so shocked nimoy is amazing and i really wish i could have met him in real life
59,startrek,star fleet would for sure try and crush them
60,startrek,i actually liked it lended to the ambiance
61,startrek,in tngs *conundrum* the crew has their memories wiped and are being manipulated to attack some weaker civilization on behalf of some other weaker civilization they start having doubts about their mission when scans reveal their targets to be severely outgunned by the enterprise and i recall in voy a number of times that voyager was considered stronger than the people they encountered in *living witness* one planet even had a holo museum in the future where they portrayed janeway and crew as bloodthirsty thugs killing their way through the delta quadrant
62,startrek,and my point is that if you love star trek you support it unless youre out getting your creative writing degree moving to la and actually applying to be on the writing team then really just watch or dontenterprise is a good show and as a fiction writer i flat out dare anyone to do better its much harder then it seemsits really not a mediocre show it had a good budget actors etc the fan base was mad it wasnt tng
63,startrek,sounds like the perfect societyfor a despot to rise to power and turn it into an empire lolif rules are only rules until the government says theyre not then the government is above the rules :dincidentally theres no reason a federation member world cant have its own fleet unbound by the pd which is a starfleet regulation  no need to secede
64,startrek,
65,startrek,not at the beginning he forbade nog going to school and had absolutely nothing kind to say or do to nog
66,startrek,a pity that you werent interested where people are from it would have been interesting to know how many non-americans did answer the survey
67,startrek,the trek admiral trope is widely overblown the majority of them are competent and good and i mean the literal definition of good the opposite of evil
68,startrek,
69,startrek,it is a hilarious episode
70,startrek,everyone always forgets that :/
71,startrek,eagerly awaiting the day these low effort posts stop being rewarded
72,startrek,exactly its not the same criticism as op suggests both had detractors tng had detractors because of some people who didnt like change disco has detractors who are st fans and tried very hard to like it and are just exhausted by the terrible writing
73,startrek,icheb got dissected and mutilated seven should have done the same thing to her eye for an eye literally
74,startrek,thanks
75,startrek,it was stated the head of the kazon stated that they had called for back up after they disabled the cruiser
76,startrek,i hear you i don’t think it was an easy decision to make-but do neelix and tuvok’s life cease to matter i see both sides i don’t think janeway is perfect but i think this was not proof of her being a bad person she was left as the sole decision maker-the person wh decides what the federation will be and stand for in a quadrant with one ship and held onto most of their ideals
77,startrek,i too wished the questions had given more room to represent a changing relationship over time because things that were true of me at 17 are no longer true today
78,startrek,&gt;i finally gave ent a chance and i loved ityou finding a couple of posts on reddit does not outweigh the millions of st fans who thought it was at best a mediocre show
79,startrek,you quit watching a show because the subreddit was badyou missed out the second season is amazing
80,startrek,there are almost 300k folks subscribed to this sub is there any data for extrapolation from reddit to the general population i get my trekkie tendencies from my mom who was able to watch the show when it first came out on tv in the 60’s but she is not on reddit
81,startrek,that was the defector when two warbirds decloak and start firing on the enterprise
82,startrek,
83,startrek,1	no more crying by michael2	kill off michael’s character 3	you now have a great show
84,startrek,for consistency purposes it seems important that you define it for the readers otherwise it seems difficult to ensure that the answers you get are a reliable response to what youre attempting to assess
85,startrek,done ive been a casual trek fan since the 1970s
86,startrek,he did give badmiral vibes at the beginning but now im pretty sure it was only to show how strained and diffident the federation had become since the burn i dont think the authors will have him do a heel turn in the last episode of the season
87,startrek,i think youre buying her bs just like the scientisti dont think shes a benevolent pragmatist i dont think she actually sees herself as a necessary tyrant who just wants whats best for everyone  i think shes just a gangster who wants money and power and will do whatever it takes to get it
88,startrek,272489 -- says so right on the sidebar
89,startrek,sorry  four tenths is two fifths and it always will be
90,startrek,agreed  the time jump may save the show   before that it was struggling
91,startrek,what about picards its just a tap in the shoulder if they wanted to destroy us they wouldve done so already line in either tin man or  defector forgot whichfair point though
92,startrek,yeah who knows how the aging of some weird dilithium life-form is supposed to work huh essentially hes transkelpien at this point no
93,startrek,sowing political discord - name checks out
94,startrek,done id like to see the results when you get them
95,startrek,deleted
96,startrek,hairy kim
97,startrek,oh man you can tell a teenager wrote this by the hilarious age response checks kid high schooler college post-college old-young people and people over 40
98,startrek,every time the enterprise was in a perilous situation with the romulans it was only because 1701-d was outnumbered by warbirds datas day the defectorin yesterdays enterprise the old ambassador class enterprise c was able to hang in a firefight with 4 warbirds of its era
99,startrek,why would they still appear when the holographic viewscreen is more advanced you understand that there is a century difference in time periods right holocoms that looked quite poor were still being used until late in the 23rd century as demonstrated by an appearance in tucby the mid 24th century the technology has advanced to physical holograms that you can interact withby the late 24th century they have managed to use those same holograms to communicate withit took a century for them to get the fidelity and bandwidth correct even then it is stated in ds9 that they are a bandwidth hogwe had 3d films in the 1950s but it wasnt until 2010 that it was sufficiently advanced enough to be in general use just like we had vr in the late 1970s but it was until around 2015 that it became viablesame thing with holograms in trek discoverys holograms are poor technology that constantly glitches a century later its advanced enough that you wouldnt know the difference between a hologram and a real personyoure still wrong buddy are you 13 years old because thats the only acceptable excuse for having so poor critical thinking skills
100,startrek,there are at *least* five not sure how many more than that though estimates vary
101,startrek,i think it must have been easier than romulan &amp; vulcan boogaloo is because the baul rly only did the thing in history cuz of being a prey species but over centuries it was prolly pretty apparent that the predator-type kelpien werent animalistic anymore after sapience thus their predator-type species nature is negated and a decent chunk of the baul must have been like huh ok and the rest is history after much back &amp; forth
102,startrek,submitted for you good luck llap 🖖
103,startrek,brain and brain what is brain  i love spock brain i think its hilarious
104,startrek,if i may make a suggestion add more options to the current age question like 46-55 56-65 etctng came out 30 years ago and i was a teenager but my brother was a teen when tmp came out and would be in a totally different bracketjust a thought for a more varied distribution
105,startrek,you must not be too far into season 3 then ╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
106,startrek,owo actually got a lot of characterization during the eden prime episode though it hasn’t really been revisited and seems forever ago she comes from a family of willful luddites which i think is really fascinating
107,startrek,thats a fair interpretation too
108,startrek,youre just not reading what i wrotei dont need to check anything because i already know the writers acknowledged statistical probabilities was inspired by the concept of psychohistory from asimovs *foundation* seriesyou seem to not want to hear my point that taking inspirations or concepts from other stories does not make something the same storystories have plots characters themes twists character arcs having one or two elements in common does not make two things identical anymore than apples are identical to oranges because both are fruits that grow on treesim going to stop now i get your point and youre right about noting the similarities but ive also made mine that this is not enough to call something the same story and ill stand by that
109,startrek,again i ask what a mr rogers neighborhood puppet has to do with anything
110,startrek,must suck to have to keep updated when they change stuff we need an episode about starfleet intelligence smuggling changelogs to qon**os** 186
111,startrek,i just realized there is a really subtle political point vance was making during the negotiationspolitically morally socially youre never going to get everything you want especially when dealing with other people there will often be times your needs and their needs will conflict true honest negotiation means you have to accept compromise there are some things you have to give up or accept whether you like it or not you got to take the bad with the good you want to feed yourself and not harm anyone**you gotta eat shit**going all the way for your ideas does not mean fighting to the end and never surrendering thats a heroes motto but its not realistic for a leader or a people to truly hold your ideas in the highest regard you have to be willing to make sacrifices for them admiral vance was willing to figurately eat shit and thats what the apple represents its knowledge its truth but its also shit and vance could handle it the good and the badosyraa was not she could not accept eating shit she spat out the apple she spat out the idea of justice and she spat on being tried for war crimes shes too much of a coward to eat shit for her idealsvance truly came out on top because he could **eat shit**
112,startrek,ds9lower decksenterprise although it has been falling for metngdiscoveryvoyagertospicardtas
113,startrek,what does a mr rogers puppet have to do with star trek
114,startrek,i thought that tomalaks threat was: we have tricked you into violating the peace treaty now you will be forced to make concessions to maintain the peace
115,startrek,&gt;or its a ba’ul child that also was transformed in the nebula by the radiation and the dilithiumgood point considering the picture book did seem to imply that kelpien &amp; baul joined the federation together since the kelpien &amp; the baul in that 1 page are kinda holding hands and the eye thingie they used as big brother originally gained a new meaning at some point
116,startrek,deleted
117,startrek,noa room fitted out with holocomms but not eveywhere on the shipa holoscreen is not the same as the holocomms in discovery saying so is dishonesttng does not have holocomms but not having the budget to do them means they were not in the show ffsit doesnt matter if projectors are seen in discovery the point is they are not in tng ds9 and voyagerdont you understand its about why the holcomms tech the actual one used in discoveryis notintng etc etcholocomms made an appearance in ds9 and it was stated it was new techso you are wrong again i agree
118,startrek,because unlike 7of9 and t’pol b’elanna  was a b cup
119,startrek,nope note how the picture book showed a kelpien &amp; a baul kinda weirdly holding hands implying the 2 species joined the federation together so its 99% likely ever kelpien after the unification thingie knows about the truth no
120,startrek,not that user whose username is opinionated dick but i felt seven of nines sexuality was a bit pandering maybe its because there was only 1 season to cover it given how talented the beautiful jeri ryan is i think a 7 of 9 show might have been more interesting than a picard series if only because and not wanting to be ageist the incredible patrick stewarts age really stood out to me in picard or an action orientated show it didnt seem like he was a sensible choice for centre-piece something more diplomatic or a hogwarts style star fleet academy show might have been amazing with patrick as your dumbledore type all knowing admiral / commander picard seemed at times like it wanted to be serenity and having 7 of 9 as a central character would be really cool
121,startrek,i chose *statistical probabilities* because theres a paper trail  check the ds9 companion the writers of the episode disagree with you
122,startrek,its exactly the same as renaming tng wesley to the rescue
123,startrek,remindme 14 days
124,startrek,yeah same here i was surprised the admiral just tanked everything to be a dick at the endlike in what world do you think she willingly goes to jail for this deal
125,startrek,yeah no youre missing my pointyou seem to for some reason not distinguish between a different story that uses the same trope or story concept and a redo of the same story*groundhog day* is a character piece where bill murray needs to find a kind of inner enlightenment and find a state of harmony with himself his life and his societycause and effect is a time travel mystery where the main cast needs to discover what is going on and find a technobabble solution to escape the loopthe *foundation* series is an epic sci-fi series spawning a good seven novelsstatistical probabilities copies essentially *none of that* and just uses the central conceit of *foundation* the mathematical prediction of the future to create an interesting character piece for bashirhavent seen *the witching hour* but im assuming its the same thingjust because story a uses a similar trope as story b doesnt make them the same
126,startrek,i think enterprise did pretty badly with viewing figures though which lead to cancellation it’s a bit different with discovery even if a lot of fans here don’t like it it seems to be really popular every week it’s in the top 10 usually 1-5 on netflix although admittedly i don’t trust that everyone sees the same top 10 it wouldn’t surprise me if it’s tailored towards mei guess my point is that even if a lot of fans don’t like discovery it’s unlikely it would be cancelled because of that
127,startrek,“yesterday’s enterprise” is in my opinion a time travel episode that was well done
128,startrek,you realise that all the view screens in tng are holographic rightin tas set 16 years after dsc the rec room is equipped with hologramsvoyager viewscreen off showing the hologridpicard talking with a romulan notice the perspective on-screen whenever the camera cuts to a different angle the viewscreen always switches too - because theyre looking at a 3d hologramin the tmp era we see similar-style holograms that feature in dscin tng they had holographic interfaces they just didnt have the budget to do them every episodeand again the holograms in the 24th century like the doctor are not comparable to the ones in dsc one is a physical object the other is not however both require projectors projectors are visible in discoverys setsso youre wrong again
129,startrek,yeah any ship with a flag officer is a flagship  any ship leading a flotilla/armada is also the flagship  the flagship of the federation is different though i think - more of an honorific than a function
130,startrek,yeah it’s this process i’m not a fan of how they end up looking either at least osyraa seemed a bit less greasy in the last couple eps
131,startrek,youre right about the gaps but i cant find anything about ships filling the role in those gaps only enterprises are listed however other ships can be seen as a flagship when they have an admiral or equivelent rank officer on board
132,startrek,and is there one statue of her on earth
133,startrek,lol burnham has the personality of a rock
134,startrek,mr franks why does every one of your movies revolve around a pivotal football gameand who would make the best goalie -- kirk or picard
135,startrek,hey that sub is really cool thanks for the link
136,startrek,i did not watch 1 or 2 season three is my first watch i have liked every episode i have watched
137,startrek,*trek* has been a combination of spaghetti-western-with-pew-pew-instead-of-bang-bang and space opera since literally episode 1 of tos
138,startrek,detmer i agree i know very little about owo and the only development airiam got was in the episode they killed her off
139,startrek,yes
140,startrek,*hellboy ii* for example had some real effective strange beasts and humanizing monsters moments so its not a huge stretch that he could create a *trek* adventure thats more like encountering truly alien creatures like the horta rather than a cold war/great politics analogy  at least thats why im into it---maybe others just dig how he does horror and think thatd be an effective add to a *trek* adventure
141,startrek,either where did i state i wouldnt like std again its ok
142,startrek,notng does not have thus tech it doesnt exist outside of the holodeck the holopanels dont exist at allvoyager made a point of confirming the doctor could not move about the ship factstarfleet would have been equiped its ships with this tech if it existed in the time period it did notthink
143,startrek,lol there *is* a jonathan franks but he does not appear to have any feature film experience
144,startrek,in fact from a certain perspective i am not aware of any evidence to suggest that the tos-era *enterprise was* the federation flagship so from sort of a strict r/daystrominstitute type of reasoning it is a matter of fact that it wasnt and a theory that it was  the primary difference between the *enterprise* and all the other *constitution* class ships exploring the galaxy is that the *enterprise* wasnt blown up/disease/interspace/space amoeba/etc hah hah
145,startrek,1 tng2 tos/tas3 enterprise4 voyager5 discoveryhavent seen others
146,startrek,1 ds92 tng3 voyager4 picard5 lower decks6 enterprise7 tos8 discovery9 tas
147,startrek,it’s interesting to see those criticisms someone posted some very old forum posts about voyager and it was the same awful people you see making youtube comments about discovery or picard
148,startrek,these are a few of my favorite things good luck with your dissert and keep on trekkin
149,startrek,headcannon is that the ruling orions of the emerald chain got the future equivalent of plastic surgery in order to project a more polished/rich/elite image of themselves to the masses
150,startrek,yep  i actually thought that some of the more interesting episodes are where the federation *does* have clear military supremacy and could solve the problem just by blowing everything up but has to figure out other solutions  the drama comes from their own internal ethical limitations not another they have triple shields
151,startrek,oh shit really forget what i said then
152,startrek,i understand but the fact that fans made similar arguments decades ago have literally **zero** bearing on whether those complaints are valid for this showif there were fans back then arguing that profit &amp; lace was atrocious television great they were right and it doesnt change whether the writing on discovery is good
153,startrek,i still have a theory that the enterprise wasnt a flagship until the vger crisis when kirk took command it became a literal flagshipassuming another 5 year mission with admiral temporarily captain kirk in command starfleet may have used the pr angle and started referring to it as the federation flagship once the crew transferred to the e-a the pr department spun it as the spiritual successor to the flagship after that it became a ceremonial thing that each enterprise is the flagship of the federation note they always say federation flagship not starfleet flagshipon top of that i would think that as it seemed formalised by picards time being captain of the enterprise actually bumps you up to fleet captain in authority for as long as you have command of the ship judging by how often picard co-ordinates multiple ships
154,startrek,agreed
155,startrek,thanks for the tip
156,startrek,they dont have to go to war they are already at war an armistice signed under duress isnt valid
157,startrek,yeah took me many years to rewatch voyager when i did wasnt as bad as a i remembered
158,startrek,i can’t give you actual examples i’m giving you first hand witness reports trust me the same arguments are played out here every day that you saw in fan magazines back then
159,startrek,in ds9s defense they had 26 episode seasons - you can ignore the mirror universe episodes entirely and miss basically nothingdis really went hard for the mu and suffers for it i mean even with everything going on this season we still had to sit through 2 episodes out of what 12 dedicated to the mirror universe i know they had a whole think about loving georgiou and doing a back door pilot or whatever but really there’s a lot happening and with the number of episodes they have to work with it felt like kind of a waste
160,startrek,im in graphic design and dissertation is looking at design fandom and psychology :
161,startrek,i kinda assumed the previous one must also have been a case of being on hand when the previous host died
162,startrek,didnt she change the whole timeline just so 22 people didnt die its probably the worst thing ive seen a captain do worse than picard not ending the borg with that virus and worse than sisco fabricating evidence to bring the romulans into the war
163,startrek,so you dont like ds9 then either
164,startrek,if you think that fans complained that the older shows were poorly-written thats fine and id be interested to see some of the complaints and id probably agree with some of them - they were sprawling shows with hundreds of episodes and plenty of ups and downs i just think its annoying to see people retort to legions of fans who are arguing that the actual writing of this show if you just treat it as television rather than star trek sucks by saying well back in the day fans were upset that they changed the look of klingons that implies that if you liked older star trek your substantive criticisms of the new stuff are actually just curmudgeonly nostalgia that isnt worth serious attention
165,startrek,ok well season 1 really enjoy date story i thought it was incredibly clever the way that if you watch it then know what the end is and you go back and watch it again you can say oh now i know what that character did thati love the trips into the terran empirei really like saru and his whole storyi like that this star trek is more inclusive not just of different human races but more alien species on the ship and also different sexualities and now more gender identitiesin season 2 i liked how they wove captain pikes story in as well as gave us more info on spock and how they picked up pieces from tasi enjoyed section 31 again and the whole philip georgioui like how you get tos sound sin the backgroundi just think it is very well done
166,startrek,which is exactly what i said about strange new worlds read what i said will honour tos dear methe tech in discovery is not seen again in any other tech holocomms which can be used outside of a holodeck holographic panelsnever seen in any kind of trek againthe holocomms wasnt glitchy it was because pike said they looked like ghosts lolas if one captain could dislike a piece of tech and all starfleet ships ditch it foreverffs such a poor in universe explanation to explain away the show maker’s error in including it in the first place
167,startrek,redditgifts did a star trek themed exchange this summer i got spock socks and a transporting mug and has lots of fandom exchanges throughout the year this could also be posted there in the r/secretsanta subreddit
168,startrek,i maaaay have thrown where tf is federation osha that theres not a medkit nearby into the living room air at that point
169,startrek,while that it true you can edit comments in locked posts so op could make a \dissertation will be posted here\ comment and edit it later\*\*ive never actually tried this on posts locked for time reasons; someone please correct me if im wrong
170,startrek,voy was much more whole-ensemble early on my criticism there would be the ensemble establishing too tidily but the pulling together under extreme circumstances handwave isnt toooo silly with the result that when characters other than the main trio got a look-in in the late run we had established giving a crap to fall back on
171,startrek,can i ask in what field your dissertation is cool topic
172,startrek,im not blaming it but ld is not for me although i do enjoy some of the easter eggs
173,startrek,i watch star trek because it gives me hope that one day the acquisition of wealth will no longer be the driving force in humanity and instead work to better ourselves for the benefit of all life
174,startrek,i was just really confused as to what was happening there
175,startrek,ive never got the dislike for neelix he wasnt a favorite of mine but he had a purpose i however do think his character significally improves after kes leaves i agree with those who said that relationship was messed up she is basically a teenager when they arrive on voyager and hes an adult i feel like that wouldnt have flied as much had the show been made today
176,startrek,this is exactly it  people have been exaggerating the reaction to tng ds9 etc for years to try to explain away fan reaction to discovery and its wearing thin  i havent seen lower decks but i think its notable that the reaction to that seems to have been a lot better with the exception of a handful of professional rabble rousers  the criticisms of discovery again with some notable exceptions have been very much valid and even its fans will recognize that on occasion with the caveat each season and a few times in-between that *this time* it finally grew the beard  you could reconstruct the tribble homeworld with the amount of beard hair discovery fans have attributed to the series
177,startrek,i said arguably isnt good in the 26 episodes of that season there are some really good episodes also some terrible ones tooof course ds9 changed what star trek was about it introduced section 31 it had a captain who lied to get the romulans involved in a war neither of those are federationdont get me wrong i love ds9 its probably my favourite itd because of its tarnishing of the goody goody image that was really introduced in tng kirk was not a goody goody that i like it so much its still positive and i think discovery is still positive both ds9 and discovery even enterprise show that you sometimes have to fight to retain what you value and sometimes that does mean you have to question your idealsfor me season 3 is where tng started to get good
178,startrek,what if its rodney dangerfield
179,startrek,the flagship of the federation is traditionally called enterprise picard was appointed captain of the flagship not the other way around
180,startrek,i don’t disagree with any of that my post was just to show that none of the arguments are new fan forums back then used to complain about the same things they are now “why does the galaxy seem to revolve around picard/the enterprise/ds9/ burnham” “this is lazy writing” “this isn’t as good as what came before” like the old saying goes there is nothing new under the sun
181,startrek,do you mean frakes he directed *insurrection*
182,startrek,the holocoms were intentionally shown to be glitchy so much so that pike had them  from the enterprise tas established that holodecks were already in use during the tos era so theres nothing canon breaking about holocoms the crew of the ent were encountering holographic communication a century earlier it makes no sense that starfleet wouldnt pursue the technology however as demonstrated on screen it was not reliable it would take until the late 24th century before the technology was advanced enough for general usethe spore drive is an experimental technology like trans warp and dozens of other experimental propulsion technology that appeared and vanished to never be mentioned againgiven that to successfully use a spore drive requires alien dna to be genetically engineered into a human the technology is not scaleable its the only experimental propulsion tech to have an explained reason its not in wider useis that all youve gotsnw is not going to look like tos its going to look like what we saw in dsc season 2 which is tos done in the 21st century it keeps the primary colours and the props but updates it to a modern standard
183,startrek,deleted
184,startrek,ooooo fincher would bring such a brooding atmosphere - almost like a surreal nolan
185,startrek,upvotedbut why i’m not particularly enamoured with any of his work to be honest any of his work is impressive and a fun ride once
186,startrek,i wish i had awards to give because i would give this an award this is a well-thought-out and balanced perspective on things which is really what im looking for im really not trying to crap on discovery i just dont know whether i have old-fashioned expectations that are unrealistic or if my concerns are legitimate then again i hear from lots of older fans that they love discovery so i dont know whats wrong with me im glad there are all these new trek shows it just feels pretty shitty to get left behind at this point it feels like a betrayal or something
187,startrek,i think hes pretty versatile but personally i dont think space opera is a good direction for star trek
188,startrek,upvoted but i think a fresh vision would be nice he is great at soliciting naturalism in few takes from actorsbut i’m not sure that’s the standard
189,startrek,if youd like to start another post ill happily join in
190,startrek,oooh i like the meal analogy
191,startrek,i don’t know why you’re being downvoted praise all around for the mandalorian lower decks  cobra kai age of resistance it is absolutely possible to do new stuff with an old franchise and also deliver quality
192,startrek,david fincher for a darker more psychological take on some villainstephen soderbergh for an ensemble-based bridge crew focused storyjon favreau for a rollicking fast-moving story with lots of cameos and callbacks to trek canonnicholas meyer for one last grand adventure in the great tradition of star trek movies of the 1980s
193,startrek,yeah i know but maaaaaan its so bad probably worse than anything in tos
194,startrek,upvoted becausei dunno i don’t take this seriously though do you really think his style fits a space opera i don’t think he has the restraint
195,startrek,oof that would be a heavy hitter if he sat down and fully invested himself with love and attention like he used to i could get behind this
196,startrek,both eminently competent directors; i’m just not sure if their cinematography partnerships would be conducive to a space opera though
197,startrek,deleted
198,startrek,he seems pretty adamant about it i actually believe he wants to bring it justice
199,startrek,i didnt demand anything im just expressing my opinion if you dont like it you dont have to read it and just move on
200,startrek,i agree it’s a little thing called honouring mythos; one can subvert expectations and make any change/addition that still respects the memory of source inspiration it seems a lot of la grads have completely forgotten this the last two decades while writing scripts in their local starbucks to some overly produced corporate playlist jazz
201,startrek,also reddit locks all threads older than 6m so if it takes more than a couple months to write your dissertation then you won’t be able to post here anyway
202,startrek,damn bookmarking that lol
203,startrek,i dont get the people who hate-watch something just so they can crap all over it but every single fandom has them
204,startrek,frankly i’d love to see a jonathan franks versionfeature length film
205,startrek,i will never buy that you can taste the difference between replicated and real food if theyre different breeds of apple sure but the whole point of a replicator is that it *replicates* things perfectlyevery time they talk about it it feels like just another way theyre trying to make st ~dark~ and ~realistic~
206,startrek,done :-=/\=
207,startrek,every main character is willing to go the extra mile for the crew its not a virtue since everyone will do it
208,startrek,there is no one right way to handle anything that deals with humans  and disabilities are all on a spectrum even specific ones  being hoh isnt the same as being deaf or deaf and there are people who are fine with hearing aids and lipreading people who cant hear a damn thing and need asl and everyone in between  for some people cochlear implants are awesome and for others they dont help much  without my glasses id be effectively disabled utterly unable to drive or take part in a lot of activities many people take for granted  with them im fine  a dog and a white cane wouldnt help me nearly as much  and there are people who are blind as a stump for whom glasses would be a cruel jokesome people dont even like assistive technology thinking it takes away an identity that they find pride in  and then there are people -- often sighted and hearing -- who just handle it clumsily trying to apply solutions across the board without actually finding out what individual people find helpful  this is how you end up with people for whom hearing aids are no help being forbidden from learning asl because some other deaf person manages to lip read okay and blind people being forbidden from learning to incredibly useful braille because some other blind person somewhere else with a completely different life context doesnt happen to need ittheres also a ton of assistive technology that we all use that we dont think of as disability aids only because everyone uses them: smartphones being the main example  hell even cars enable us all to move at a hundred miles an hour and carry thousands of pounds while we do it  the line between tools and disability aids is extremely blurry  geordis visor is somewhere in thereit also doesnt make him just like a sighted person  his visor gives him way more information than human eyes do; data made this point in measure of a man that they are superior to biological eyes  so he isnt exactly the same as a sighted person with the visor; hes still quite uniquewe modify the person *and* the environment for ourselves all the time  humans are sometimes defines as tool using primates  and we have to have the freedom to choose the tools that work best for us as individuals  there are general trends and best practices but they cant be applied -- forgive the expression -- blindly
209,startrek,i shared in this wtf moment
210,startrek,guillermo del toro
211,startrek,take another look at the films the klingons were redesigned in the first and third films again for tng and yet again in the sixth film while tng was airing
212,startrek,someone in another thread referred to it as star trek: this is uspretty damn accurate
213,startrek,i really wonder what a tarantino science fiction movie would look like hes essentially mashed up every other genre but has not done a science fiction movie yet
214,startrek,threaten to blow up her own ship every other episode too she doesnt play games
215,startrek,okay so she only killed one person that makes it okay imagine if immediately after talking to the moral centre of the entire fucking franchise she did exactly as filmed but shot whatsherface with the ‘blue’ setting so we knew that seven despite the anger despite her brutal background still knew the right thing to do that’s star trek instead we have this morally vacuous just another tv show that insists on directly contradicting and undermining the characters of our upbringing
216,startrek,because it fits the vision of star trek its never been a setting where the federation and the characters never fail or make mistakes the whole arc of the series is that the picard and the federation tried to do the right thing failed and then it took a while for them to get back on their feet theres nothing about it thats dystopic
217,startrek,thats quite a morbid sentiment when talking about ocampa
218,startrek,not entirely everything is about ratings and feedback besides i am not whinging about it never have i dont watch it and i dont accept it
219,startrek,what if vance was more like khan than vance
220,startrek,awesome take i think theres two ways to interpret the difference in how tng and ds9 handled the ferengi one is that ds9 was responding to a flaw in the surface-level writing the ferengi received another is that ds9 was demonstrating that surface level understanding as seen in tng is hardly enough to really know a people - even ones that appear at first glance to be as one dimensional as the ferengi
221,startrek,fair enough i gave up five episodes back enjoy i’d be less bitter about how awful this show was if it was the only bad one of the batch but this seems to be the direction they’re going with the franchise i’m a bit surprised fans don’t expect better in star wars terms this is the rise of skywalker when we could be having mandalorian with some proper creatives
222,startrek,tngds9tosentvoydsci haven’t seen enough of the rest
223,startrek,in case you are real sorry in case youre not - well you know
224,startrek,i bought a  3d chess set its the coolest thing but i have nobody that will play it with me
225,startrek,im a fan of the show it aint perfect and theres room for improvement but thats every star trek showi find the trek rabid fan base more irritating than the most irritating parts of the shows
226,startrek,starfleet is more of a peacekeeping force than an actual military organisation unlike the klingons and romulans it’s like comparing the police to the army
227,startrek,i agree 100% not just with this post but with many commentsim sick of it being the michael show and i miss the science tng was technobabble sprinkled onto real concepts but dis is real concepts sprinkled into technobabble and they rarely actually have scientific discussionshow the hell is discovery going to inspire kids to be engineers or scientists when all we get is a random clip of them staring at a screen waiting for analysis its like the writers think thats the boring part that needs to be quiet partive never seen a show squander the few things that could have been really great captain pike was amazing but oh he needs his own showsarus arc was great but they keep undercutting him with michael tilly their history of replacing captains every seasontilly could have had an excellent arc over the series lacking confidence and bumbling when nervous feeling like the barclay character deciding to work on herself and focusing on training taking command training against everyones judgement kinda like troi really suffering through it but constantly working on herself then by the end shes surprisingly capablegoing to the future opened so many new possibilities the burn is lame plot writing crutch imo but whats worse is that somehow michael does a bit of digging and she finds info a whole galaxy of scientists couldnt get some of this the sooner they realize what made star trek work was the *ensemble* and stop forcing michael and philippa down our throats the better this show can be theyve painted themselves into a corner where the only way to stay interesting to make michael some god-level character and lose all credibility
228,startrek,its pointing out that you cant change it so there is little point whinging on the internet about it
229,startrek,ive also watched every episode of disco and every goddamn episode i try so hard to find the redeeming qualities and every goddamn episode im disappointedi feel like im in an abusive marriage waiting for my shitty partner to see the light and changei think discovery is too deep down the writing toilet at this point just holding out for the pike series
230,startrek,matter is energy at a subatomic level  but its easier to build something if you can just rearrange existing atoms instead of having to convert it from one type of atom to anotherso its kinda half true in both cases  energy is ultimately the limiting factor but you can reduce your energy needs if youre recycling organics rather than converting inorganics
231,startrek,if you want i can print the page regarding the comm badges as a pdf and send it to you pm me if you’re comfortable receiving an email from a stranger you should at least be able to pull the official design off of it
232,startrek,she didnt go on a killing spree she stunned everyone and killed the woman who basically dismembered icheb stun setting is blue kill setting is red
233,startrek,never fear michael burnham is here  would have been a more honest name for the show
234,startrek,cheers mate ill do my best to design some having fun with it regardless its things like the correct angles of the curves im sure someone a lot clever than me has worked it out ill try and source it
235,startrek,&gt;why did the writers make our characters go to a sex club and then have tilly do some drugs doesnt sound any worse than the naked now tbh
236,startrek,take your upvote and get out
237,startrek,i low-key hope culbert or adira actually *does* die so michael has to live with her decision instead of just getting bailed out with a no harm no foul happy ending
238,startrek,discovery will be considereda classic in a decade
239,startrek,its a shitty point to begin with
240,startrek,couldnt agree more about burnham all the manufactured whispered melodrama and marvel superhero trash eats up all the time that could be used for the other crew members and story tellingive never tried so hard to like a show
241,startrek,agreed each show got to be the new kid at some point lets not be needlessly cruel to someones favorite trek
242,startrek,somethings felt off about vance and the federation since discovery found them  this episode only reinforced that for me
243,startrek,that and theres only so many times you can do the same stories in the same order with the same formula and still be fresh and likable* introduce planet/forehead of the week * sweeping brassy theme * rejoin p/fhotw    * introduce buddy comedy b-plot * commercial break * a twist * commercial break * analyze twist    * preach about it * commercial break * technobabble solution * roll credits    * paramount logo sting
244,startrek,im watching enterprise netflix right now on a 60 lg screen dunno if there is any upscaling going on but it looks fine
245,startrek,because no one wants to argue with you over your pedantic point that doesnt matter anyhow
246,startrek,also keeping the doctor’s mobile emitter violated the temporal prime directive they used it mostly responsibly but as the episode “drone” points out they run a huge risk of letting it fall into the wrong hands
247,startrek,but it still wouldnt have happened the way it did without her she absolutely drove the narrative if the episode didnt focus on her then she wouldnt have been the main character it wouldve been one of the klingons
248,startrek,roxanne dawson could have pulled so many great torres stories it’s really too bad they squandered her
249,startrek,that barge of the dead episode was written by ronald d moore and was originally written for worf back in tng  so one of the only character episodes for her is from the trash pile of another character
250,startrek,i cant tell if that is a dig at the navy  ha
251,startrek,good for you
252,startrek,blame brannon bragahes got a boner for time travel  and yeah hes not good at doing it right either lola well done time travel episode can be great but usually its just a naked framing device to do something fun and ignores the logical questions it raises
253,startrek,dreadnaught
254,startrek,inaction is a form of action if good men commit to action that which is immoral then good men will have committed evil
255,startrek,filled out i was pleased to assist a fellow academic best of luck with your dissertation
256,startrek,yes people had aesthetic &amp; canon complaints but people also had many of the same complaints they had now for example go to the season finale discussion thread and sort by controversial&gt; i have so many questions&gt; why did the writers make our characters go to a sex club and then have tilly do some drugs was that really necessary are we supposed to take that mirror georgiou is bisexual why would the show do that who wanted that in fact who even wanted nudity in star trek like who asked for that i certically didn’t&gt; are we supposed to seriously believe that general cornwell and co decided to destroy a planet and then changed their mind after some brief words from burnham also: what is it with new trek and destroying planets&gt; why did starfleet hand l’rell a nuclear bomb why did tyler go with her why does nobody ever have to answer for any of their crimes in this show&gt; an absurd and moronic first season - the worst first season of any trek show utterly and generically average with not a single original or interesting episode - comes to an end the writing here was painfully on-the-nose every emotion and meaning telegraphed bluntly the contrivances were ridiculous and the attempts at idealism delivered poorly by a show whose droll realism simply cannot handle more abstract philosophizing&gt; like most soap operas discovery makes you feel obligated to watch and manipulates and steers conversation with its gimmicks this is writing by committee advertising executives and corporate pr experts totally cynical&gt; well that was just terrible at least i can finally stop hate watching this show they took what was beautiful and fun about star trek and turned it into whatever this was dark angry war imagery all season long awful tie up loose ends writing and the slap in the face ending with the enterprise showing up and they use alexander courages is original beautiful theme music over the credits no way gene roddenberry would have okayed any of this season ive now seen it once and unlike every other iteration of star trek i do not want to see it again&gt; so michael burnham saves the entire galaxy yay&gt; good job writers&gt; why so much bs feels and long speeches  &gt; stupid ending stupid burnham principles are all we have really what about the billions of lives on earth whose fate you put in the hands of lrell&gt; i have been thinking about the episode all day and how i felt about it i worked came home watched some reviews on the youtube i find that i do not care this coming from a guy who cares a lot for the franchise if this is an attempt to get a new audience by pissing off over half of the people who like the franchise i think they have succeeded its like fanboy fiction for narcissists they keep banging me over the head with bad writing and unbelievable plot direction and then change direction because they got tired i like all the star trek franchises but this one grates on me were there some good story lines yes but then they went into a different direction i feel empty much like the showpeople have been complaining about the poor writing on this show since the start the only thing that has changed is that those people arent constantly buried in downvotes as much anymore because more people on here have realized that this is not a well-written piece of television
257,startrek,all thats required to do evil is for good men to do nothing
258,startrek,my wife and i joke when starting every episode that oh this is the one where michael cries
259,startrek,starfleet certainly seems to have a different meaning to flagship than navies if seems to be mainly a prestige thing and not an operational one she rarely has a flag officer on board there are also personal flagships for admirals or task forces so it may not even be exclusive to one shipi also dont think it was ever applied to earlier enterprises so i think it may be a prestige term that developed for it due to the legacy of its name
260,startrek,yeah ive interpreted ds9 as doing the ferengi well precisely because they critique the ferengi so ably rom may be the most obvious example but aside from the grand nagus zek *all* of the main ferengi characters are in some way screw-ups by ferengi standards and therein lies the critiquerom doesnt have the lobes for business but as his son notes hes a mechanical genius nog is a tenacious and disciplined worker but hes got poor social skills and hes got a chip on his shoulder moogie is a financial wizard but shes female in a society that officially discriminates against them even quark who is the best adapted of the bunch nevertheless wont cross certain ethical lines that the rules of acquisition say you should cross without compunction all of them in their own way poorly realize the ferengi ideal and all of them are cast to the margins of ferengi society as a result only quark is able to eke out an existence and thats usually portrayed as pretty meager and small-timewhich actually makes for a far more compelling critique of ferengi society than tng was able to offer tng hamstrung by roddenberrys writing presented the ferengi as the worst aspects of colonialism capitalism and imperialism then they presented a race that visibly did none of the three very well two not at all and had them jump around like hamsters on angel dust for good measure it wasnt an effective critique because the ferengi were so obviously presented as to be worthy of contempt for reasons that had little to nothing to do with ideology but showing a functioning society that nevertheless casts really valuable people to the curbside simply because they lack business acumen or in moogies case the ability to show her face in public thats a really cogent criticism right there and it allows for much more character development of individual ferengi to boot
261,startrek,yep
262,startrek,ah apologies my bad will remove
263,startrek,&gt; the federation president is mentioned by vance but still hasnt been shown is it because theyre saving it as a cameo by a well-known actor in the finale or is there something else going onanother user posted a theory in this thread that vance is actually in charge but almost nobody knows it i really like this theory reminds me of snowpiercer the series not the movie
264,startrek,good point about assignment earth was it a spin-off or a network-promoted crossover episode for a new show you know like flintstones meet the jetsons or something
265,startrek,sure i think books would count
266,startrek,most advanced different thing
267,startrek,guess not everyone can be jeffery combs  im still not sure of all the rolls he played
268,startrek,the first time i saw her in the show i assumed that was going to be the new data character imagine my surprise when we learn nothing for almost 2 full seasons and then they kill her
269,startrek,&gt;  picard s1 ld s1 and disco s3 are the only seasons with a coherent story uninterrupted by writer changesim not sure im familiar with that usage of the word coherent
270,startrek,same thing happened with jadzia unfortunately and i liked jadzia and worf
271,startrek,but also there are a lot of people who will swoop into a discovery thread only to say this show sucks balls and then start crying about their valid criticisms being silenced
272,startrek,trick is to never take time travel or mirror universe seriously the franchise is too vast for coherent rules on time travel and the mu is a goofy concept but the episodes themselves can be fun take it seriously and youll be disappointed but suspend believe and treat it as a romp and you can have a good laugh
273,startrek,happy cake day
274,startrek,i don’t know i think people here are being fair even polite especially in their replies i’ve rather enjoyed the discussion and whether downvoting sobering because they’re wrong in your opinion is a correct use of the feature is for everyone to decide on their own hell i sometimes do it when somebody makes an outright false claim
275,startrek,&gt; a galaxy wide disaster being perpetrated by a kid being emotional is so much worse than even spocks brain that its not even funnydont worry michael burnham will fix it
276,startrek,go back to the threads about the first season of discovery that was literally the main complaints then
277,startrek,1 tng2 ds93 disco4 voyager5 enterprise6 tos
278,startrek,time travel is the ultimate band aid for shitty writing
279,startrek,yeah with both shows its the writing that let the show down the actors the crew the special effects are all pretty top notch for a modern tv show its a bummer
280,startrek,its not murder its initiative
281,startrek,the fact that some people had slightly silly aesthetic criticisms of star trek some decades ago isnt really relevant to whether the new shows are well-written pieces of television
282,startrek,you say forced labour campsi say galags that help enforce a social contract for the sake of the moral political position of socialism
283,startrek,who is comparing new trek to old trekdiscovery is just bad all on its ownthe show-runners pulled in writers from cws latest crop of ahistorical melodramas and 90210 on purpose presumably so the show we got is the show they wantedi hear *defenders* of discovery try to compare it to old trek-- saying that tng took 2 whole seasons to get good and each bad season of tng was like twice as long as discos seasons so mathematically speaking we must all be patient and wait 4 seasons for discovery to get good  uhh -- no sorry if you only make half as many episodes a year then you ought to be making them *twice* as good not stretching your failures over half a dozen half-seasons
284,startrek,forced labour camps with machines that explode your head
285,startrek,funny i didnt get that impression at all to me he seemed to become more resolute
286,startrek,but *cause and effect* is a redo of *groundhog day*  *statistical probabilities* is a retelling of the foundation story  and *sub rosa* is *the witching hour*  some of these are very intentional  and regardless they are all simple storylines that should be entirely comprehensible for an accomplished director like frakes
287,startrek,remindme one week
288,startrek,would you count star trek books as memorabilia
289,startrek,that episode was a true rom-com
290,startrek,i know that but the same conversation happened then
291,startrek,time travel episodes are greatthe mirror universe is over played over used and over acted ds9 and discovery over used it so it became boring and just plain silly like you saybut time travel episodes used sparingly definately work see past tense and tomorrow is yesterday for top notch examplesinfact past tense aired today 26 years ago
292,startrek,they only changed them once — for the first film which was eight years before tng
293,startrek,this is the exact reason ent was canceled when it was the fans turned their backs on it for no reason only to post on reddit 20 years later i finally gave ent a chance and i loved iti think people just need to stop trying to be cooks in star treks kitchen
294,startrek,thisthreshold i yelled at for the future evolution without either further generations or varying selective pressures as an 11yo who was being raised young-earth-creationist so that should be a sign of how obvious those problems werediscovery ive given up on yelling at bc in particular after the find the red angel bit i dont expect it to scratch my overanalyzinator itch -- i expect random stuff that doesnt make sense thrown together ill still watch it bc my husband is uncritical and couch gravity exists but im not really invested
295,startrek,thats all understood the issue is that its making the show worse
296,startrek,yeah but i remember the exact same “why did they change the klingons” conversation
297,startrek,remindme 7 days
298,startrek,done \
299,startrek,&gt;mary suenone of this please it is against our rules
300,startrek,the deal was a trojan horse to undermine the federation
301,startrek,what makes romulans so interesting politically speaking is “what happens often on romulus” a frequent change of government this makes them seem volatile and untrustworthy how can you negotiate peace when the government of today will not be the government of tomorrow then comes in the shadow government the tal shiar
302,startrek,reminds me of the time on ds9 o’brian got a phaser from a “weapons locker” but it was clearly a spray painted cheap rubbermaid plastic case
303,startrek,true but as fc showed it still would have been effective
304,startrek,well yes you essentially just agreed with mecapitalism is a method for distributing limited resources technology in a post scarcity world mean there are no limited resources anymore or at least few enough that it doesnt cause quality of life issues  you dont need a system to apportion resources when you dont need to apportion resources anymorecapitalism doesnt have to mean inequality thoughyoure assuming some kind of zero sum system where every winner has to have a corresponding loser too but thats not the case especially with post scarcity  even before that increases in general wealth and economic vitality raise everyones effective wealth - a rising tide can raise all boats in capitalismanother way to examine it is to look at purchasing powerie how much you can get with the capital you have  you can probably roughly define middle class as able to get everything you need and wealthy as able to get everything you want  because replicators and holograms effectively reduce the cost of goods and services respectively to zero everyone has extreme purchasing power and thus is functionally rich and can stop thinking about money and focus on higher maslovian goalsagain thats not a repudiation of capitalism  thats just it becoming somewhat obsolete  but so is the flip sidefundamental aspects of socialism like high taxes and redistribution are equally obsolete in a post scarcity society
305,startrek,hes an admirable admiral and the very model of a modern major-general
306,startrek,i love how this sub will downvote a well thought out and well written comment like this just because it conflicts with their head canon
307,startrek,its cool i get it and im never going to say youre wrong for having the opinions you do were just different when it comes to our takes on the franchise i started watching tng in the 90s and right from the get-go it was full of stupid nonsense and the stupid nonsense continued through to today and i guess ive just grown up fully accepting it and to me it wouldnt be trek if it didnt have any stupid nonsense in it it would feel really weird to me if it were that tightly polishedthings are to me supposed to be a little fantastical; things that shouldnt happen *do* happen and ive grown to actually love that
308,startrek,that might be what they end up doing make a sister ship of discovery with experimental recreation of spore tech they haven’t really talked out recreating the tech in a while and according to this episode paul has been trying in between all the other crazy stuff they have had been doinghell after burnhams little stunt he might refuse to work with her again so they need a second ship for her to be on
309,startrek,if it had been stated then id agree  but given the actual dialogue in the episode and what was currently going on then it was a silly option
310,startrek,absolutely correct decades worth of british tv shows with 6 episodes per series miniseries and standalone movies have shown us that it is very very well possible to develop characters and relationships in less than 20+ episodes but you have to do it
311,startrek,jett reno works her way into my head during the early hours of the morning so i think thats where it kind of came frombuuuut im glad you laughed and i guess humor hits differently for everyone  have a great weekend :-
312,startrek,1 deep space nine2 enterprise3 voyager4 next generation5 original series6 lower decks7 picard8 discovery9 animated series
313,startrek,he seemed scared and desperate to me
314,startrek,temporarily they could attack at any time which is what made waiting hours for tuvok to control the array a poor option
315,startrek,ive read a few of the myriad books and enjoyed them you might give those a try mostly read tos-based ones theres a good one with the horta i read about 30 years ago cant remember the title
316,startrek,i dont hate discovery season 3 but the writing is still weak too many forced emotional moments and nonsensical decision makingi adore tilly but making an ensign acting first officer that bothers me to no endbooker and adira are both excellent additions to the crew love those characters
317,startrek,&gt;  it is believeable in the world it sets upim not asking for scientific realism star trek is soft serve sci fi at best sure its much more scientifically accurate than star wars but that is not what im getting at when i say the show isnt believeable i am not talking about the scientific aspects i dont want to type it all out again as i mentioned it previously but its with regards to things like no one bothering to solve the burn before michael turned up tilly being promoted to xo michaels mum being a nun on vulcan
318,startrek,that actually makes a lot of sense especially when you point out that the romulan-federation conflicts around the neutral zone rarely even pose the threat of an all-out war and considering the federation managed to reach a ceasefire with the romulans without needing dedicated warships it would make sense that they wouldnt build any after the ceasefire until a threat emerged that would require them to do so
319,startrek,again 20/20 hindsight she didnt know and at that stage the fighters had stood down
320,startrek,it gets so scattered and really just ridiculous towards the end rafi made me almost not want to watch the show i hope you like it though
321,startrek,done
322,startrek,another fact i didnt know about :
323,startrek,ive seen this defense banded about *a lot* that people wrongly hated on 90s trek and so they must now be wrongly hating on the new stuff but the first two seasons on tng are still not good voyager didnt really get good until season 4 enterprise was incredibly stale until season 3 dont fall into the trap of just dismissing everyone whos critical of the new shows theres some very valid criticism out therei see a lot of unrealized potential in discovery i feel like its always just on the cusp of getting good but it keeps stumbling ill keep watching because there are great moments and good characters in the mix and ill probably never not watch star trek even if it sometimes makes me cringe
324,startrek,i dont care about the aesthetics attitude or setting though i just think the writing sucks
325,startrek,stamets acting was greatwe came here for *you* how could you do this to us
326,startrek,i agree but i think star fleet took a harder left after the wolf 359 incident and this what started the defiant program hence why the uss defiant was pulled out of mothballs for the domion war the domion war change star fleet just like the borg did star fleet realized how easy a new viable threat outside the alpha and beta quadrants could be
327,startrek,there are stories of him editing the days footage at a bar with the cast and crew after filming i feel we can all aspire to that
328,startrek,it is but useful to consider tuvix was doing bits of both but both are full time roles so sooner or later something would have to give absolutely
329,startrek,&gt; minimum i ask for a tv show/story is that it is believeable in the world it sets upwith respect i think this is where youre getting tripped up with star trek its never really tried for realism and i dont think it wants to i mean theres so much tech in trek that is just impossible and situations that make no sense at all and thats just part of the experiencei think *the expanse* is a great example of a believable world with believable characters and situations
330,startrek,they may have actually used him in the show if manu wasnt a huge jerk
331,startrek,the fighters proved to be enough of a match for voyager in other episodes the kazon leader has said there were more ships on the way janeway had a very narrow window in which to act
332,startrek,well i was technically correct
333,startrek,and yet almost everyone seems to like the mandalorian maybe these new creations really haven’t been as good as you think they are
334,startrek,no certainly not but there was likely quite a lot of pushback against doing it at all and that line was the compromise that allowed it to happen baby steps and all that
335,startrek,this is my list but with tos and discovery swapped id place lower decks above picard
336,startrek,workplace safety on the discovery must be *horrible* if a single fire-sensor malfunctioning already leads to venting the whole jefferies tube into the vacuum of space; with zero warning to the multiple life-signs inside said tube nor any emergency force-fields to protect them from also getting vented into spaceanybody crawling in there to do any kind of welding or repairing of interior sensors must be constantly shitting their uniforms
337,startrek,you could always look into fanfiction
338,startrek,done glad i could help
339,startrek,id love to discuss this further but it might veer too far from the topic of star trek specifically so in short: fiscally everyone cannot be rich at the same time in a capitalistic society as it requires profit to function which means that it would result in hyperinflation or a stupid-exploited/restricted underclassnot to mention that replicator technology easily accessible super-intelligent ai and even more accessible renewable energy sources basically disintegrate quite a few cornerstones of the very idea of goods or services&amp;#x200b;anywho back on topic: the tiny remnant of starfleet and the federation by proxy in discovery s3 appear to truly not use any outside resources **at all** see: the this apple is made of shit moment even if they did have capitalistic tendencies back in the 24th century which i disagree with but am open to changing my mind given proof
340,startrek,spielberg
341,startrek,im generally a quiet lurker sorry :x
342,startrek,rapid-fire stupidity: you just keep throwing flashy shit at the audience so fast they dont have time to think about the plot which doesnt make any sense
343,startrek,the attack had finished the cruiser destroyed and the fighters no match for voyagertheres also no indication as to when reinforcements would arrive or what theyd look like
344,startrek,tarantino im still waiting
345,startrek,he normally is the editor
346,startrek,the federation during this period - 2360s did not produce warships of any class canonically speaking that is until the arrival of the borg and the wolf 359 incident in response starfleet brougnt on a young commander sisko to develop the defiant class you’ll get to that in ds9 stafleets first debatable war ship so with this in mind yes the enterprise is usually out gunned galaxy class starships are what would be the backbone of starfleets galaxy line including nebula class among others their primary mission is exploration starfleet didn’t anticipate war since the signing of the kitomer accords there has been relative peace even among borders with non-kitomer accord planets namely cardassia what you see early on in tng are border skirmishes with ships crossing the neutral zone etc the romulan’s one the main antagonist through out tng push their luck with warbirds aka dderidex class much like the galaxy class the life blood of the romulan empire they however as the name implies are built for war they are an imposing threat to any lone federation vessel
347,startrek,im pretty sure archer never once violated the prime directive just saying
348,startrek,if you dont want a funny show why are you watching lower decks i dont get it
349,startrek,&gt; thats their stated aim theyve already realised it hence the nickelodeon show for children and the in-development starfleet academy for teensaye i more mean im gonna wait for the pudding to be cooked before i judge their execution&gt; for what its worth thats how dsc was developed bryan fuller and alex kurtzman picked their favourite tos episodes and looked at what worked for them - and tried to inject the tos weirdness into dsci think the only big difference with how snw will come about is the planet of the week structure i fully expect it to look like and feel like dsc season 2i meant even more literally on snw with a tos based cast on the enterprise its can be very on the nose for fan service it only makes sense for it to maintain the general look and feel theyll certainly give it its own identity though with the ship and uniforms a planet of the week show will also let the writing teams try a different approach which is a good thing
350,startrek,favreau seems to be the anti-abrams lately turning everything he touches into gold
351,startrek,&gt;	what happened to geordie was the latter but what we seem to do in our society is the former we try to make accomodations for people whereas they didn’t even need to make changes to the environment to accomodate geordies disabilityexcept that we do modify the person in our society to the best of our technological capabilities geordie has his visor so that he can see; this is no different than wearing glasses sure not having 20/20 vision isn’t typically seen as a disability but if you have horrible eyesight and have no way to deal with it you’re not going to be able to do the things everyone else can like drive or play sports we as a society don’t get rid of those things or modify them so everyone can do them; we modify the person by giving them glasses people who are hard of hearing sometimes functionally deaf can sometimes get hearing aids so that they can hear we give bracers and wheelchairs to paraplegics so they can move around and have surgeries to try to fix the disability we very much do modify the person first and will then attempt to modify the environmentstar trek has always pushed the philosophy of the needs of the many; if you can “fix” a person’s disability then that is the more practical solution than to modify the environment especially if that isn’t feasible
352,startrek,&gt; i think people overlook voyagers unique circumstances as well if picard or sisko had been faced with tuvix they likely could have called on federation support had replacement officers while they worked out how to handle the situation likely through a drawn out legal process thats just speculation :&gt; she was also faced with replacing a tenured tactical officer and a newly onboarded chef alongside an unknown entity claiming they were bothwasnt tuvix already doing both tuvixs and neelixs job&gt; then at the end of the episode the entity refuses to submit for the procedure demonstrating that the combination of neelix/tuvok is not willing to embrace starfleet morality sacrificing oneself in a common themewhich is why janeway had to step in to do the right thing
353,startrek,considering the quality of  competing shows the budget and the massive trek canon to draw from discovery and picard are terrible shows
354,startrek,done  good luck on your dissertation
355,startrek,yes weve yet to have episodes of 2010s trek where:  - captain saru abandons the ufp starfleet and discovery of his own free will as confirmed by an empath to become a private explorer and adventurer  - we learn that humanoid dna was somehow latently guiding all life on earth vulcan etc toward evolving humanoid forms as intended by the preservation-minded intelligent designers  - evolution in general is a pre-ordained path encoded in each individual disco gets some points here for misusing the term evolution to refer to maturation  - captain pike brings some armed terrorists to the leadership of a paranoid society to express their legitimate concerns and then peaces out pretending that the building wont immediately be leveled by the chief of anti-terrorism and the collateral damage blamed on the federation  - the ships second officer who has been in starfleet as long as harry kim had been alive when voyager started has trouble understanding common idioms and is corrected in conversation by the ships non-sentient computer  - the shows particle physicist chief science advisors made-up particle system takes center stage over story and adventure strictly violating the old tos writers guidelower decks has directly confronted the implications of the tng-eras dogmatic new prime directive compared to the tos oneone thing the new and old-new shows have in common is too much writer churn tng season 2 was supposed to be a single arc about the borg but the writers strike and otherwise firing on average 1 writer per aired episode for the first two years made that impossible  picard s1 ld s1 and disco s3 are the only seasons with a coherent story uninterrupted by writer changes
356,startrek,&gt; that’s a vulcan precept not necessarily a starfleet concept and the prime directive concerns starfleet particularly as it is general order one and not a written part of the federation charter starfleet does believe in at least a similar concept remember what riker told troi in her command test&gt; also be mindful that the prime directive wasn’t originally designed for star trek for the purpose of being a foil against captain kirk it stands for the purpose of showing that kirk is moral and would do the right thing even if it’s against the rules see tos “the apple”yeah kirk did the moral thing like janeway did remember the city on the edge of forever kirk chose the needs of the many there too&gt; but also note that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one is a moral quandary it’s an ethically horrible rule that is basically stating the desires of the mob can be used to run rough shod over the smallest human minority the individual it’s communistic in nature and reflects the worst aspect of democracy it’s why the us was formed as a republic in the first place it says the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few not the needs of the many let you run rough shod over the smallest human minority lol&gt; i would say that tuvix death is analogous to the train which is on a track running toward five people janeway chose to switch the track so that the train would kill only one allowing two to survive but ethically this is murder whereby leaving the situation as it stands it’s just a by product of random chance or the unfolding of circumstances over time to take no direct action is equally undesirable but it is more ethical as it doesn’t initiate the act of murder in the first place to deliberately take no action is making a choice to kill multiple people kirk and janeway got that :&gt; whether that makes janeway more “starfleet” or less is up to the viewerid say its pretty clear the janeway way is the starfleet way :
357,startrek,sam raimi or ang lee honestly i have mad respect for both of them
358,startrek,captain maxwell  he tried to warn the federation about the cardassians and they didnt listen  if they had just let him continue its possible they could have even avoided the entire dominion war saving the lives of millions of federation citizens  captain maxwell did nothing wrong
359,startrek,leiutenant ayala wasnt used with the same frequency as the bridge crew on discovery also that is 124 episodes over 7 24 episode seasons some of the characters that i have an issue with are in every episode of discovery and the issue is t the characters themselves its their underutilization to the point that im left asking why they are there
360,startrek,deleted
361,startrek,this gets thrown out a lot in defense of new trek implying that trek fans are just being overly critical dwelling in nostalgia afraid of anything different and that after a few years new trek will also win its way into most fans heart  basically the implication is that early criticism of trek shows is not valid because of character flaws within trek fandomthe fallacy of this argument is that the first couple seasons of tng ds9 and voy are objectively terrible  if all we had was the first couple seasons of those shows they would not be remembered and celebrated with the fondness they have today  fans criticisms of those shows when they first launched were accurate and honest  once those shows improved and only once those shows improved did they win the hearts of the fansits certainly possible for disc and pic to become as cherished as older trek  those older shows made huge improvements in quality and the fans rewarded them with their love  however there is little evidence to date that the flaws in the new shows will be corrected and to simply dismiss criticisms as fans being fickle is insultingtldr; yes fans criticized older trek shows when they were introduced because they were terrible  once those older shows stopped being terrible the criticism stopped  if disc and pic stop being terrible the criticism will stop
362,startrek,&gt;so it could build on tos without breaking canonhowever they did nonetheless and even contradicted themselves at timesone of the popular things that broke canon was bashir placing the eugenics wars in the wrong century and no one objecting to it or when starfleet had first contact with the ferengi in tng season 1
363,startrek,an ancient civilisation of cardassia with a similar culture to the bajorans pre-occupation
364,startrek,soderbergh no question hes very good at pacing and works with extremely good editors
365,startrek,i can appreciate that he is there when the crew needs him
366,startrek,i always figured the d was the flagship primarily because picard was on it and their mission was to be the frontline contact for various diplomatic emergencies and sensitive dilemmas  he was the face of the federation when they needed to send onesoon as picard retired i figure that role fell to some other elder statesman and his ship
367,startrek,discovery has holocomms and a spore drive no other trek series has this it is too advanced for trek 150 years later lol the spore drive is never mentioned again in any other star trek showthe makers of dsc had to explain away all the advanced tech in order to make strange new worlds which bassd on what we have seen will honour tos with of course a few updates to make it modern but snw will look be more like tos than tmptos is the original on which eveything is basedof course it looks dated it was made for 125k per show
368,startrek,ah i see thanks for your consideration with spoilers im close to the half-way mark with both tng and voy i just got to the borg arc in tng havent wathced ds9 though ill keep watching then
369,startrek,haha yeah i was just saying this  half the crew of the voyager are maquis terrorists and youre telling me none of them can rig a time bomb  where is chief obrien when you need him
370,startrek,&gt; nobody is thinking carefully through the problem they’re just rushing in phasers blasting when you land on a strange planet all by yourself not knowing if anything you could eat/drink/breathe will kill you and the very first thing you offer to trade away is your tricorderthat was one of the notes i would have done in episode 1 of season 3 and we were already off to a good start
371,startrek,appendix b should be picard negotiating for cloaked warbirds i tried the link just now and it seems to work for meand you’re right they are all more for comedy most of the serious negotiation scenes are generally a lot simpler - safe passage food hostages etc i’m not sure there’s ever been a scene as complex as working out an interstellar alliance including formal terms the other scenes i can think of with comparable tension and focus on acting would be in in the pale moonlight and if just focused on acting there would be additional garak scenes that would qualify although garak feels a bit overacted compared to vance perhaps because of how poor screen quality was then vs now and how much you would need to emote to sell a performance on a blurry crt vs crisp 4ki think the closest thing i can come up with seriously would be the wounded scenes with maxwell or the final scene with gul macet which aren’t really negotiation per se but carry some of the same weight
372,startrek,i agree with you even if i dont enjoy some of the new trek and your point about how society evolves trek evolves with it is precisely doing what star trek has always done the trek of the 90s was different than the 60s because the times changed for us star trek is best when it comments on the current times now thats also why i struggle with discovery 3 seasons in im still not entirely sure what that show is trying to say maybe its not trying to say anything but at that point it loses some of the magic of what makes trek special for all its faults picard is leaning into some of the current socio-political issues of our time we can argue all day about whether we like seeing that in star trek but i appreciate what it is doing
373,startrek,but seriously could it be david cronenburg
374,startrek,lower decks is a comedy the other star trek series arent
375,startrek,they would have likely refit the galaxy class enterprise as much as they could until they felt they needed to decommission it to swap it out with the sovereign class enterprise which if the enterprise d lasted longer then it did they do a sovereign refit enterprise
376,startrek,i didnt say the *did* turn the enterprise into debris my argument is that they *could have* if were splitting hairs then its important to note that worf also reported casualties and that was with just a few shots and the enterprise at red alert to correctly judge the extent of the damage we should also consider geordi la forges report in an attempt to get the shields back up he has to exceed operational safety limits as well as redirect power from the structural integrity field and partial shielding still wouldnt be ready for another 30 minutes if the romulans had attempted the enterprise it seems likely they wouldve succeeded without much effort considering the damage they dealt with what was essentially a love tap compared to what a warbird is seemingly capable of
377,startrek,indeed im just assuming that all enterprises are flagships
378,startrek,she truly is an evil admiral  more evil than any i can think of previouslyshe wiped out twenty years of a timeline  think about how many lives she affectedat least in all good things the stakes are literally the existence of the human race and apparently most of the galaxy so you can sort of absolve picard on that groundi think the only way to really square it is that future janeways timeline still exists but that seems to contradict the way weve seen time travel work before in star trek
379,startrek,that weapon was not designed specifically against the borg but for environments that shut down energy directed weapons with dampening fields
380,startrek,the only non-burnham character i care about is linus
381,startrek,i figured it was the same argument as to why babylon 5 used phased plasma guns instead of lead bullets that it would be quite risky using bullets that could puncture the hull and cause explosive decompression
382,startrek,&gt;a lot hangs on cbs realising that so we can only wait and seethats their stated aim theyve already realised it hence the nickelodeon show for children and the in-development starfleet academy for teens&gt;snw is almost certainly going to get a lot of fawning because it does pay huuuge lip service to tosfor what its worth thats how dsc was developed bryan fuller and alex kurtzman picked their favourite tos episodes and looked at what worked for them - and tried to inject the tos weirdness into dsci think the only big difference with how snw will come about is the planet of the week structure i fully expect it to look like and feel like dsc season 2
383,startrek,the borg were not adapted to that weapon just like phasers are effective in their first few shots picard stroke down two or three drones with the tommy gun onlythe borg would have adapted to that weapon eventually
384,startrek,i was already a fan when tng debuted the thing people disliked the most was that picard wasnt kirk and that the enterprise d was like a cruise ship most of the criticism of discovery revolves around bad writing and nonsensical plots a galaxy wide disaster being perpetrated by a kid being emotional is so much worse than even spocks brain that its not even funny
385,startrek,thats what i mean no doubt she is a murderer but if the last episode showed anything she is doing what she thinks is best in an unforgiving universe i would like to see the emerald chain and federation forced together against a greater threat some of the best of ds9 was when cardassians bajorans and federation where forced to ally
386,startrek,maybe but they did try for a few weeks to figure out a way to save everyone i would think they would have thought of that on the first day
387,startrek,im glad you enjoy iti personally dont find it enjoyable to watch at all but its good to know that dis is at least appealing to some people out there
388,startrek,he should have gone the extra mile and jumped out an airlock
389,startrek,neelix was annoying no wonder tuvok went through hell and kes neelix treaded her like a little child
390,startrek,on the other hand there are thousands of people who love discovery and enjoy every minute of it so maybe it‘s just a writing style that isn‘t for me either that or there are other aspects such as the cgi or specific content elements that people love so much that they just don‘t pay attention to the rest i honestly can‘t tell right now i guess we‘ll know in the future - excitement over anything that‘s new and glitzy whether it‘s great diversity in the cast or great cgi will wear off in time
391,startrek,in my opinion the only reason they were stranded there was because for some bloody reason nobody on the ship could figure out how to set up a time bomb  and thats on a crew full of *freaking terrorists*  if obrien had been on voyager hed have that done in an hour
392,startrek,it sure is but i didnt want to infer that best ship necessarily means flagship
393,startrek,the season 3 finale will be the first time the writer that started the story gets to finish it season 1 and season 2 were both planned out by one showrunner and finished by a different oneso again i think its remarkable that it holds together as well as it does and is as good as it is
394,startrek,i hear tell the original prints of b5 are whats being used for the new itunes releases not remastered but at least of a quality thats the best were ever going to get sadly but i can live with itso long as they can stick to making different shows its exciting i agree a lot hangs on cbs realising that so we can only wait and seesnw is almost certainly going to get a lot of fawning because it does pay huuuge lip service to tos once that dies down well see if its not a hollow shell would be a shame for it to be a bit meh as anson mount really did bring something good to the pike role although conversely the whole show exists because of the pike character and anson mounts portrayal so its got a good start id really like to avoid it being st: fanservice though
395,startrek,roms a idiot he could fix a straw if was bent - odo
396,startrek,tuvix was not a federation citizen or a member of janeways crew  therefore he has no rights in her eyes  tuvok on the other hand was a starfleet officer and it was her duty to protect him  and as for neelix his survival was just an unfortunate consequence of that decision  to me thats the real moral dilemma of the episode  yes you have a duty to tuvok but what if saving tuvoks life means not letting neelix die  thats a very tough call to make and as terrible as it was that neelix had to live janeway had no other choice
397,startrek,what if its landrew  or control
398,startrek,&gt;the mandalorian is almost universally praised while it features new characters in new adventures in a new time it’s well written well produced and keeps in mind what made the originals popular the trick to the mandalorian is that its well written and well produced discovery cant really claim either
399,startrek,just filled it out
400,startrek,so im too earlygotta check that date again
401,startrek,you can disagree but it doesnt make it a fact the in-universe depiction of technology is consistent with being the middle ground between ent and tmp even roddenberry said that tmp is how tos always looked he didnt even think the klingons needed explaining - he just decided they always looked that way tos is the only star trek show that looks like tos so its the visual outliertng era doesnt look as good visually as the film series is what i was saying but a lot of that is down to the lighting and props in-universe you can see the progression from the tmp erathe too advanced argument around dsc doesnt hold up to any form of scrutiny the only radical addition is the spore drive - but its a technology that cant scale up so it sits alongside trans warp and all the other experimental propulsion technology throughout star trek that are depicted and then forgotten about
402,startrek,at no point have i said i didnt like this show or really any star trek show i liked picard despite its issues too but youre missing the point it has the elements of being one of if not the best trek shows but to me it feels like they write the climax for each season first then just wing it on how the discovery ends up there
403,startrek,i was treading lightly trying not to spoil things if you plan on watching ds9 and voyager or hadnt gotten to the borg arc yet in tngthere are a number of ships that were purpose-built to serve as more heavily armed weapons and their whole inception and purpose was to deal with new galactic threats  memory alpha may not label them as warships as such but that is what they functionally are  the akira prometheus defiant and even the sovergn and inquiry classes were all conceived as threat responders plus a few more i cant rememberthe galaxy changes *a lot* in the 5-10 years after season 1 of tng
404,startrek,&gt;the federation builds ships that can fight while everyone else builds ships for fightingas simple as it is that may actually be the answer when we see interaction between the romulans and the federation the threat of violence is always present thus the romulan warbirds being built as warships specifically have a chance to shine while the other qualities of the federation starships are less relevant the higher top speed of the galaxy class for example wont likely enable them to win a battle we also see some evidence of this in season 3 episode 26 of star trek: voyager &gt;faced with a superior enemy in species 8472 the borg in firepower superior to the voyager are helpless however the crew of the voyager specialized in exploration and research finds a way to defeat species 8472&lt;
405,startrek,voyager was under attack they didnt have a few hours tuvok made a statement based on what they knew but realistically there is no way to know whether his initial assessment was accuratekazon reinforcements were on the way as well
406,startrek,you can find my work at on behance if you wish to this is information i share on my reddit profile
407,startrek,yeah fuck all the people it will affect as long as you wanted it
408,startrek,&gt; they disable it in a simple fly-by maneuverop im sorry for splitting hairs but that attack resulted in 70% loss to shields not a smoking pile of debris
409,startrek,talk about not seeing the forest for the trees
410,startrek,she had to she was in uncharted waters  but she didnt abandon the federation principles she just bent the rules a bit
411,startrek,admiral jadedway
412,startrek,he’s also the voice of osiris in destiny 2
413,startrek,they did it just didnt get past the prototype stage and the schematics were classified  in ds9 theres an episode with an assassin using a prototype tr-116 rifle that shoots physical projectiles  he also attached a micro-transporter to it and a scope that could see through walls but thats not part of the initial designi forget if it was specifically addressed in the episode but my best guess is that the federation doesnt want to be seen as developing anti-personnel weapons that only have a kill settingthe tr-116 does pop up in the relaunch novels in the destiny trilogy  maybe other places i havent read a lot of the relaunch stuff
414,startrek,tuvok literally says they can but itd take a few hours
415,startrek,it sounds like you want to create a better future for your children i can help you with that
416,startrek,reparations for the slavery that was inflicted on her people for centuries
417,startrek,badgey as president  wouldnt that be scary
418,startrek,and im sure you call a big-mac a salad because it has a leaf of lettuce on it
419,startrek,id absolutely love a remastered b5 but alas thats even less likely than a remastered ds9im very excited for this new era of trek because they seem to be taking the approach that not every show has to hit the same audience i suspect were going to see a lot of fawning praise over snw because its intentionally aiming for that comforting nostalgia of the older shows
420,startrek,i mentioned it in another comment just a few seconds ago season 3 episode 20 tin man a romulan warbird incapacitates the enterprise in seconds after having its engines running at 130% capacity for an extended period of time no doubt consuming a great deal of energy the crew of the enterprise assumes that afterwards the ship wouldnt be able to make it back to romulan space so some damage to the ship can be assumed still despite the fact that the enterprise knew of the intentions and the presence of the romulans it was taken out of the race fairly easily if the intentions of the romulans had been the destruction of the enterprise its likely they wouldve succeeded
421,startrek,slavery
422,startrek,well done cbs you hit every point of criticism maybe next time dont use a brand new account that hasnt posted or commented anywhere just a tip
423,startrek,its the same actor  you can tell by the voice
424,startrek,refering to melora i think they said that there is a way to enable a low g environment while she moves through the station but that wasnt compatible with the cadasian hardware
425,startrek,did you forget voyager was under active attack during the caretaker encounter
426,startrek,glad to hear it no offense meant rather i’m just a professor
427,startrek,youre absolutely correct of course its kind of ironic that a show about a post scarcety society finds one of its greatest real life villains in capitalism alas hardly surprising thoughfor me im not currently keeping up with disco since ~2 episodes and will binge the season at a later date the expanse is scratching my itch very nicely atm and i havent got all day to watch tv im pleased in a way that disco is continuing to push more trek shows into production as one of them may hit the spot for me id love to be a fan of disco as its trek but its just another show to me atm when the low budget outlier  trek show is announced ill get excited again i still think b5 is better than ds9 and will die on that hill
428,startrek,watch caretaker voyager was badly damaged and under attack when the caretaker situation was going down they didnt have time to sit down work out how the array worked work out how to blow it up on a timer and go home
429,startrek,i completely disagree; discovery is way more advanced than any other trek that is factso youre saying ignore tos and now tng too lol
430,startrek,not only is the latest discovery season not very trek its just flat out bad  they try so hard to shoehorn woke moments into every episode and it seems like theres some overly emotional were a family moment every ten minutes  they should have been assigned a ship counselor as soon as they arrived in the 29th century because they obviously need it
431,startrek,they didnt know the extent of kazon tech they had only encountered a small proportion of one tribe who seemed to be able to call in a large number of ships at short notice
432,startrek,i dont see what ossyra is doing that is so evil she was oppressed by males of her species and humans that believe in human superiorityif anything she is a heroine
433,startrek,fair enough
434,startrek,thanks for filling it in and for your thoughts into your fandom i think its because the term fandom means something different depending on who you ask that lead me to write your fandom but your quite right that participation levels inside the fandom vary massively and the fandom may be better when referring to the community as a whole
435,startrek,the enterprise - e is the best ship in the fleet laforge st insurrection
436,startrek,an enemy more powerful than the borg wanting to destroy all life vs the borg who were slowly but steadily expanding but were able to be resisted by some janeway made the right choice
437,startrek,you investigate anomalies in a nebula enterprise c comes out an you’re thrusted into the alternate timeline where the federation losteventually the dominion took over the quadrant with sone areas controlled by factions like the tholians
438,startrek,thats a fair point and i didnt think of the idea of a timer
439,startrek,i think people overlook voyagers unique circumstances as well if picard or sisko had been faced with tuvix they likely could have called on federation support had replacement officers while they worked out how to handle the situation likely through a drawn out legal process janeway was on her own with a crewmember that was created by a freak accident and she had no idea how long the effects of the plant would hold or the health conditions that may arise in the future she was also faced with replacing a tenured tactical officer and a newly onboarded chef alongside an unknown entity claiming they were boththen at the end of the episode the entity refuses to submit for the procedure demonstrating that the combination of neelix/tuvok is not willing to embrace starfleet morality sacrificing oneself in a common theme
440,startrek,i dont think shes bothered by what other people about her
441,startrek,my impression was the exact opposite picard never seemed worried in those situations i always assumed that the d was more than a match for 1 warbird the threat was the potential of war no an existential threat to our heroes
442,startrek,sg1 already did that lol
443,startrek,spoiler for season 3 episode 20 ahead in the episode tin man both the empire and the federation learn of a new lifeform designed as a spaceship in an attempt to make first contact the empire sends two dderidex class warbirds one to intercept and incapacitate the enterprise the other to take it from there even though the romulans had been running their ships engines at 130% capacity to keep up with the enterprise they disable it in a simple fly-by maneuver and proceed to attempt to meet with tin man and it was not a surprise attack either the enterprise was aware of both the presence and the intentions of the romulan ship
444,startrek,isnt he though im sure youve seen him that episode of enterprise where he works at a plasma clinic drawing specific blood from people for the xindi hes great in that - you hate the character but the acting is good
445,startrek,for a show you dont like you seem awfully obsessed with talking about it i dont like sons of anarchy a show i admit is well written but not for me you dont see me hanging out on the sons of anarchy reddit boring its fan with how much i dont like itwhat we have here is a you issue i cant fix that and it doesnt change my enjoyment of dsc or the fact that its so well reviewed
446,startrek,i feel like there is an excellent opportunity for the show to revisit soliton waves as well
447,startrek,when pressed the thing this user didnt like was all the women and gays they called it virtue signaling this user is a fascist
448,startrek,i don’t think that’s a fair assessment people like evolutions of cherished content when it stays true to what they loved the mandalorian is almost universally praised while it features new characters in new adventures in a new time it’s well written well produced and keeps in mind what made the originals popular you can’t just discount valid criticism of something like kingdom of the crystal skull as “my childhood”
449,startrek,she also would have sentenced a pre-warp civilisation to slavery add to that there was no guarantee theyd be able to operate the array without the caretaker and the whole she shouldnt have broke it argument doesnt hold much water
450,startrek,its superficially more advanced - ie flashier but the holograms didnt ever really work the computers were bigger and everything was a bit less uniform which fits perfectly if you advanced ent a hundred years 15-20 years later and tmp presents a sleeker-looking technology with a more unified version of starfleet likely helped by most of the older ships being destroyed in the klingon warif you ignore tos completely visually the series is consistent from ent&gt;dsc&gt;tmp era arguably the tng era doesnt fit as well but that was back to having an 80s tv budget so it was never going to look as good visually as the movies of the time
451,startrek,i personally cant think of any time in the series in tng at least where one ship really threatened the enterprise-d i always got the impression that the enterprise would wipe the floor with most other ships in one on one combat any time they seemed at risk of getting into a battle they would lose they were normally outnumberedthats actually one of the things i really like about tng a lot of their problems *could* be solved with violence; they had the strength to take and do what they want without being stopped a lot of the time but they never did; it was always about the *right* way of doing things rather than the easy way
452,startrek,🖖🏻done
453,startrek,the problem with that is that we should not as an audience be agreeing with them there really needed to be some kind of buildup that would let us see why saru would entrust tilly with the position when others would doubt the choice so that we can side with him the writers going somewhat meta about the decision does not resolve the fact that the decision needed to make more sense tilly needed to show some kind of progress to make it believable that she could be entrusted with command of a ship and by that i dont mean progress the episode of as disco tends to do frankly if they were storyboarding this out she probably shouldve gotten promoted last season or early in this one even just not being an ensign wouldve helped a lot because you wouldnt have to justify in writing skipping over much more seasoned senior officersvery long-winded way of saying i dont believe everyone else saying it was dumb rectifies it being dumb for it to work from a viewer perspective we have to believe the decision while understanding it looks dumb from the outside because otherwise it makes saru look dumb and the positive results that will inevitably come from the decision will look suspiciously like luck
454,startrek,yeah the enterprise d especially in next generation was pretty formidable im also reminded of an episode where a single federation starship got hijacked and started shredding its way into cardassian space it would sometimes find itself outgunned or outmatched but generally it wasnt usually one enemy ship doing it its one of the reasons why the start of the dominion war featured a galaxy class ship getting destroyed so easily to demonstrate how powerful they arenow you want a ship that gets outgunned easily every episode thats voyager a prewarp civilization could throw a rock and some poo at them and tuvok would be reporting that shields are down
455,startrek,&gt;its a good show you can disagree with that but the majority view is that its good no excuses need to be made  &gt;  &gt;\- person in an abusive relationship with a poorly written show that again thinks justifying things makes it better
456,startrek,not op but anytime tomalak showed up he seemed to be a credible are you ready to *die* threat  my impression was always that the two ships were equivalents of each other in power but because the warbird was a dedicated warship versus the enterprises resources being partly devoted to science a dderidex could outgun the d
457,startrek,done good luck with your dissertation
458,startrek,&gt;federation warships are tough motherfuckin beastsare they memory alpha only lists four federation ships under the category warship the crossfield class which is a refitted science vessel the constellation class which was what picard served on prior to the enterprise and which he described as an *overworked underpowered vessel always on the verge of flying apart at the* *seams*** and which with a crew of 40 can hardly be considered a massive warship the defiant class which was discontinued due to technical problems with the design and the alternate timeline galaxy class doesnt sound too convincing am i missing something
459,startrek,sure but there’s a difference between “ugh i hate this stupid bald captain why is he bald” and legitimate criticism
460,startrek,kind of agree also very odd that op is anonymous
461,startrek,yes this is an undergrad project that wont be published thanks for the warning
462,startrek,i filled it in and hope its useful for youi think you should be careful about whether fandom means the same thing to everyone one of your questions refers to your fandom which i think implies that fandom is just a noun for the act of being a fan whereas i think a lot of people view the fandom and simply being a fan quite differently where it is much more about participation in a community around that show/product akin to a king-dom except for fans i am a member of this sub and rarely post/comment and i like a few st meme pages on facebook and thats about it im certainly a st fan but i wouldnt consider myself as belonging to the st fandom unless i was more participative in that community of fansalso if you want a good case study for fandoms you should consider looking at supernatural those people are fucking nuts
463,startrek,hey dont lump daniel tiger in with those posers
464,startrek,same i would have filled this out but noticed there was no mention of an ethics review
465,startrek,my area of study is graphic design and so my dissertation is also looking at branding that is used in fandoms which is why i included a questions that touch on merchandise
466,startrek,even before the show premiered the showrunners said michael burnham was the main character and it wouldnt have a traditional focus on 3 or 7 charactersits a good show you can disagree with that but the majority view is that its good no excuses need to be madeif you dont like it thats fine but dont mistake your opinion and the echo chamber of disgruntled fans and youtube grifters for anything approaching an objective fact
467,startrek,definately unpopulardsc has more advanced tech than any other star strek show all of which are set after it except entso dsc is the outliertos was made 50+ years ago
468,startrek,1 tng2 ds93 discovery4 lower decks5 enterprise6 voyager7 picard8 tos
469,startrek,ive got that episode on right now
470,startrek,every one of the new star trek productions deviates pretty hard from star trek i first watched tng on tv as a kid and then again in my twenties but i didnt see ds9 or voyager until recently the tone dialogue writing style story progression production techniques etc of those 3 series felt very similar like star trek none of the current productions labeled star trek feel like star trek the orville feels more like star trek
471,startrek,its an unpopular opinion im sure but when the tech gets there id love tos to be given a facelift to bring it visually closer to the movie erai was shocked when i realised tmp is set 3 years after tos and yet it looks completely different its a big reason i dont listen to people complaining dsc looked too modern - its aesthetic was actually perfect when you slot it between ent and tmp tos is the outlier visually
472,startrek,i never got annoyed by neelix to be honest i always thought he was a nice comic relief character or just simply a kind character he always had an upbeat personality that sorta made the whole theme of voyager much less depressing
473,startrek,thanks for the tip ill do both
474,startrek,&gt;but a single romulan warbird of which there appear to be many can seemingly turn it into a smoking pile of debris without much effortwhich episode was that op  lol this never happened
475,startrek,ironically the continuation of tng is voy it tried to be a carbon copy but most of tng is only good because of those specific actors and characters telling exactly the same stories with different people doesnt work voy didnt get good until it stopped trying to be tng season 8
476,startrek,its because its such a big budget high profile show that theres a lot more pressure on the showrunners to deliver a lot of people dont realise that being a showrunner isnt just writing scripts - its managing a small companythe expanse started as a basic cable show theres far less pressure and scrutiny from the studio on a show like thatds9 is the only star trek that was virtually but not completely free of interference because it was considered low profileand whatever subjective discussions can be had about the ultimate quality of dsc from a commercial stand point its a raging success for cbs-aa not only is it driving subs to their service its done well enough to convince them that they need a new episode of star trek every single week at a minimum and its made them a ton of money internationally too obviously commercial success is no barometer of quality looking at you transformers but it does demonstrate that the show is popular with a broad audience in that context cbs doesnt need to worry about die hard star trek fans and their complaints
477,startrek,i hope this is an undergrad project which won’t be published cause if not you need an irb or could get your school and self sued
478,startrek,do people forget equinox i mean i wish i could she orders a star fleet officer from equinox tortured for information i love janeway but yeah no she’s not picard or pike
479,startrek,in germany ld starts on january the 22 so i just wait
480,startrek,i thought the show would be about the uss discovery since everything from cbs says it’s about the crew of the uss discovery regardless though its a poorly written show if you have to make excuses like those as to why you enjoy it and it can’t stand up to criticism without again making excuses for it it was fine season one but it’s still the same thing 2 seasons later this is almost as bad as people making excuses about why the walking dead is still “good” it’s ok to like a show but still want for it to be better
481,startrek,not all replicators use shit the admiral said that was the matrix they were using
482,startrek,pirate bay
483,startrek,i dont think so there are other shows like the expanse which is space themed and follows and properly develops multiple characters each season has 10-13 episodes its not only the ships crew but other characters on other planets that we get to know all while weaving a compelling story       what people dont understand is that discovery is not an ensemble show like all the other trek shows but thats understandable because it tries to present emotional plot points as though it were the problem is like someone said ealier it hasnt developed the non-michael characters enough to earn those emotional cues
484,startrek,i think that’s part of my complaint about the show tng is the pinnacle of trek imho tng’s “number one” always felt like the bridge crew as a whole they were definitely character specific episodes but for damn near every member of the bridge crew disco occasionally peeks in on the others but its rare and minimal
485,startrek,&gt; if you want to question something the group of bridge officersincluded some random woman who doesn’t have any lines and not nilsson suggesting maybe sarah mitich wasn’t available for the episodeyeah i was wondering this - mitch hasnt been in the last two episodes and has been replaced by a different character  in-universe explanation is presumably shore-leave but all seemingly off-screen
486,startrek,u/sveitthrone made the point further up the thread that the janeway that comes to the past is a variation of the evil-admiral trope always present in star trek; she had grown jaded and ready to break even the temporal directive in order to get what she wanted our janeway merely reacted to this in the only way open to her to assure the safety of the crew since the borg queen was now aware of future-janeway being a variable in other words future-janeway committed the sin so janeway could have this win without guilt
487,startrek,no its the material  she says the watch could be a meal for someone else so why cant they just take a small asteroid and use that matter insteadand again really were complaining about replicators logic now
488,startrek,well there was that one episode that showed belanna going to the holodeck to beat herself up essentially over and over to feel something but thats less personal hobby and other interests and more weird cry for help thing your right we know nothing about belanna outside of her work other than that she loves tom i think this series deserved better writing and i love this series
489,startrek,
490,startrek,1 tos2 tng3 ds94 ent5 pic6 voy9999 discovery
491,startrek,i love star trek but i have no illusions that star trek in the end as aspirational and inspirational it often is is a media franchise and especially in these days these are kept alive and made to make money the zeitgeist changes and sometimes i might not be in it anymorewe got a bit of a skewed perception there a lot of franchises run pretty much on nostalgia hell there are two books and a movie now out whose soll content is mindlessly listing off as many 80s references as possible and it prints moneyid rather star trek not become this frankensteins monster of hey remember the thing you liked as a kid and instead bring the franchise forward in a narrative way and find ways to stay relevant i love the tng era but i would be very happy to get a new era and the cool thing is discovery delivers there with season 3 picard delivers there both also deliver messages that are relevant to these times the quality is wonky i have a lot to say about the things i dont like and would rather see but yanno at least the develop the setting forward instead of always going in circles
492,startrek,did you miss the entire part where she was essentially suicidal upon finding out the marquis got wiped out the cardassian missile episode title is escaping me i think it was dreadnought essentially revolved around her and her role in the marquisyou see so much of her inner character development as her relationship with tom develops
493,startrek,- ds9- tng- voy- tos- ent- - - - picard- discovery
494,startrek,i think the misogyny thing vis a vis orions is more out of universe though - the controversy is how theyre written not how the characters view orion societywe do have one in lower decks though and shes already broached the issue of harmful orion stereotypes so maybe well get more exploration of it there
495,startrek,the writers abandoned that thread
496,startrek,yeah absolutely though disco so far has been concentrating on personal journeys of characters rather than looking at whole societies and cultures they did it a bit with the klingons but that didnt turn out great similarly i think we missed big opportunities to look at how human society might have changed yes they seemed xenophobic but has anything else changed culture music vulcan has had some monumental changes would have been fun to see how that had changed the planet and culture instead everything comes to the ship and the episode focuses on michaels personal journey the vulcans and romulans dont seem to have changed they are just allies it would have been cool to explore the mysoginy issue with the orions but unless we get an orion cast member i dont think itll be brought up
497,startrek,that’s a vulcan precept not necessarily a starfleet concept and the prime directive concerns starfleet particularly as it is general order one and not a written part of the federation charter also be mindful that the prime directive wasn’t originally designed for star trek for the purpose of being a foil against captain kirk it stands for the purpose of showing that kirk is moral and would do the right thing even if it’s against the rules see tos “the apple”but also note that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one is a moral quandary it’s an ethically horrible rule that is basically stating the desires of the mob can be used to run rough shod over the smallest human minority the individual it’s communistic in nature and reflects the worst aspect of democracy it’s why the us was formed as a republic in the first place i would say that tuvix death is analogous to the train which is on a track running toward five people janeway chose to switch the track so that the train would kill only one allowing two to survive but ethically this is murder whereby leaving the situation as it stands it’s just a by product of random chance or the unfolding of circumstances over time to take no direct action is equally undesirable but it is more ethical as it doesn’t initiate the act of murder in the first place whether that makes janeway more “starfleet” or less is up to the viewer
498,startrek,in all instances where we someones pov while theyre being transported most notably in tng:realm of fear it shows there is a continuity of awareness before during and after transport if the transporter were destroying the person and creating a new person on the other end it should appear more as a black out with awareness stopping at beam out and starting again once beam in is completesomehow the transporter works in such a way that allows for consciousness to continue uninterrupted during the transport process
499,startrek,anyone can make a mistake and then keep paying for it for years afterward; janeway most-likely broke the prime directive right on her maiden-voyage but the rest of the series is her trying to atone
500,startrek,thank you this is a point a lot of folks seem to be missing maybe they weren’t around when the first star trek renaissance happened so they don’t remember how much the tos fans shat on all of the new series all those years ago but i do a perfect example is ds9: it’s beloved now but it was despised for being different than what tos or tng gave us there was a lot of hate for ds9 for a long time
501,startrek,i hope i get to see that   i might miss out on it
502,startrek,poor chakotay is probably the most static character of the entire series giving him a true identity by actually having him be a part of a real tribe would have been a good start on improving his character
503,startrek,in the golden era of starfleet that the audience knows well i agree in this era though almost certainly saru must be one of the more experienced active duty officers out there
504,startrek,pike: *sees horrible future resolves to make the sacrifice anyway*janeway: i never much cared for causality anyway
505,startrek,the difference all old new trek was set in the future post tos except enterprise so it could build on tos without breaking canondiscovery should have been set straight into the 32nd century to avoid canon breaks and use of tech clearly too advanced even for voybut fair critism is just that fair
506,startrek,this is a big-budget show on a major network  if people watch ratings go up advertiser pay more and agents can negotiate higher pay for their actorspay doesnt go up because of people having bigger parts it goes up because of advertisers paying more  it all starts with writing  make the show better and the rest are what we call good problems to have
507,startrek,not the same unfortunetly weve had five seasons of new trek now and its nothing like as good as it was 5 seasons into the tng era
508,startrek,yep true but for me theres just not really much that is similar between old trek and new trek so i dont see the point in labelling them that way id probably like discovery more if it didnt have the star trek brand attached to it i like star trek which is something specific to me these new shows are not that so i dont see why im supposed to like them theres little in it for a star trek fan like me it seems
509,startrek,pretty much having a loud minority that hates all the new stuff is just a fact of life in entertainment give it 20 years can you imagine being the person that hates new trek and new star wars  anything past return of the jedi and new ghostbusters and the 4th indiana jones and probably daniel tiger  just sitting in the dark screaming my childhood
510,startrek,there is a difference between having the weapons and using them to conquer for example while it was a highly unstable and imperfect solution a nuclear arsenal on both sides during the cold war prevented each side from engaging in an all-out conflict as it would have meant mutual destruction this same power dynamic may be what enabled the creation of a treaty between the romulan empire and the federation of planets as i cant see any other reason for why the romulans would agree to such a treaty however on a smaller scale it is different whenever it is not a clash between the empire and the federation but instead between individual spaceships the enemies of the federation regularly seem to have the upper hand would it not be wise of the federation to match the firepower of their enemies at second thought it might also be a different issue entirely the panzerkampfwagen vi was considered one of the most powerful tanks in ww2 however less than 700 were ever produced thus having superior firepower in individual units wasnt enough to defeat the over 30k tanks that the soviet union had in t-34s alone if however a single tiger was to meet with a single t-34 the tiger would be likely to succeed i dont know enough about the economic strength of either the empire or the federation to prove or disprove the hypothesis do you know anything more
511,startrek,never thought of it that way but she *does* show up like the devil on janeways shoulder
512,startrek,what point in existing if you never did something from the heart no matter the cost
513,startrek,she did as far as i recall that was part of the reason she wrestled with that decision adhere to the prime directive or doom the ocampa she chose to save the ocampa thus stranding voyager
514,startrek,ugh yeah this  ocampans live to 9 so id say calling a year for us a decade in their development would be roughly accurate  and i think she actually says shes almost two in the first season  i recall her having a birthday at some point in the first few episodes so lets just say shes two at the start of the show  neelix has obviously known her for some time  even if he only met her say three months earlier that would make her one and nine months which means she was basically 18like damn neelix  thats pretty predatory
515,startrek,i was having this conversation the other day with a friend remember when tng came out and the die hard trekkies from the 60s had an absolute shit fit pepperidge farm remembers
516,startrek,too soon
517,startrek,sounds hot
518,startrek,dont forget to deactivate the president before you leave the room
519,startrek,once its signed are the federation really going to tear it up and go to war
520,startrek,randomly turning into spiders
521,startrek,third seasons of say tng or ds9 were both excellent heres the ratings of discoverys third season so far along with a trendline: 
522,startrek,whats positive about taking star trek and making it just another generic violent space opera
523,startrek,this post was  because you have a new account and we get a lot of spam from newly created accounts if your post is not spam please send a message to the mods **with the url of this post** letting them know so they can fix it for you llap*i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit/message/compose/to=/r/startrek if you have any questions or concerns*
524,startrek,fuck rick berman all my homies hate rick berman
525,startrek,the federation really didnt start to develop actual warships until the dominion war had already started lolthe federation builds ships that can fight while everyone else builds ships for fighting
526,startrek,back when one of the best star trek games to date elite force came out i used to load up a 1 on 1 bot match against a maximum difficulty neelix bot the thrill of hunting neelix through the corridors of voyager was matched only by the satisfaction of vaporising him with a hirogen hunting riflewas this insane probably did tuvok have a similar holdeck program almost certainly
527,startrek,federation technology is always just good or bad enough to serve the needs of the story being told
528,startrek,&gt; though i just thought of something osyrra doesnt seem to have noticed she has a dilithium vault on board discoveryi would like to think they offloaded the dilithium vault aside from what little dilithium discovery might need which is far less than a normal starship because of the spore drive no point having all the dilithium on board the one ship that doesnt really need much
529,startrek,the federation seems to perpetually get caught with their pants down  its not in their nature to fortify defenses or expect aggressionfederation warships as few and far in-between as they are are tough motherfuckin beasts though so its not a technology problem
530,startrek,the new trek feels less like trek and more like jj trek but thats up to a matter of taste indont get the hate to other fans all the time
531,startrek,hit up the star trek shitposting group on fb its got 20 or 30k members i think
532,startrek,check out the tolkien oral history project
533,startrek,that looks like a marketing scam as the only questions are about merchandise
534,startrek,the fact that you can manage to watch early series neelix without wanted to claw your eyes out of your skull is a pretty good sign for things to come  🙃seriously though enjoy the show  its very uneven but it is a lot of fun
535,startrek,i think it’s her dad
536,startrek,you should post a new thread nobody will see it if you post in this thread  wed all love to see it
537,startrek,fair  someone else pointed out he left the vdraysh because they werent federation enough
538,startrek,i’ve always gotten the impression that outside of the dominion and borg collective the federation is probably the largest interstellar state in the galaxy both in population and special volume  that being said the sheer number of ships and starfleet personnel makes the risk of losing ships here or there worth it to maintain peace at all cost
539,startrek,lower decks absolutely alienates older people who dont want funny trek or maybe that kind of funny trek  somehow many people who grew up watching tos in the 70s never developed an appreciation of the absurdist humor of monty python snl or sctv i do not understand that
540,startrek,im sure that is part of it but imo it is more the lack of character traits/development mentioned above that is to blame
541,startrek,ds9tngentvoypicarddiscovery is on my watchlist i think picard has more potential with the next season and tos - some day i will watch it
542,startrek,i think it was enough for me anyways janeway says at one point the risks to subspace was too great &amp; affects too many people to justify under any circumstances she even says herself that even progress or scientific curiosity has some boundaries that shouldnt be crossed i feel it was justified
543,startrek,i can see that argument  the stereotype of the rich miserly jew or whatever but i cant really say i see that in the ferengi  and the idea that was the intention of anyone involved in the show is too absurd to be believed  to me the ferengi arent based on any current world country or ethnic group they represent the idea of peak capitalism and in that way are more just a reflection of the worst of all of us because the whole planet is driven by capitalism
544,startrek,recently i’ve hypothesized that michael burnham will be a villain like kahn she does whatever she thinks is right and people seem to trust and follow her implicitly she is constantly going rogue and ignoring ordersthis is completely opposite of the way the crews would operate in the past where there would be discussions and compromise i doubt the writers did this intentionally though so i’m probably reading too much into it
545,startrek,a lot of negotiations in star trek actually happen offscrren--we see what leads to them and everyone coming out happy but not the meat of it this especially in tng where they ferry a lot of ambassadors and negotiators around
546,startrek,does data dream of electric sheep
547,startrek,the federation uses dilithium to channel the energy created by matter/antimatter annihilation reactions which would otherwise blow up the ship we can assume that romulans used their artificial singularities to generate energy but they still needed something to channel that energy from a destructive into a useful configuration so there’s no reason to believe they didn’t also use dilithium
548,startrek,ds9tnglower deckspicardvoyagerdiscotostas
549,startrek,its why i like the roswell episode of futurama the best
550,startrek,many of us knew who the crew was on tng ds9 and voy when season 3 was running with discovery theres a solid group of people that i have no idea who are because theyre just there for some reason theyre meaningless in the larger picture and whats the larger picture in discovery something-something *michael burnham* but on ds9 as an example you get to know the main crew people connected to members of the crew employees of some of them again eg quark with rom nog leta etc we get to know garak we even get to know garaks father and we come to understand how he is as a person it spreads out all of this depth was present in classic trek because they made sure to give us layers upon layers from the very beginning discovery has no layers its all superficial and they keep presenting us with big climactic emotional moments all the time as if its going to move us somehow and make up for lacking depth but this just loses its effect michael burnhams massive messiah-pathos just comes across as tiresome and overdone is there nothing more to it than this somehow i am more interested in paul stamets than michael burnham if in some unexpected twist michael burnham dies perhaps then they could devote more time to the rest of the crew so we could get to know them and form some sort of connection with them oh well
551,startrek,you’re in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down and you see a tortoise it’s crawling toward you you reach down you flip the tortoise over on its back the tortoise lays on its back its belly baking in the hot sun beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can’t not without your help but you’re not helping why is that
552,startrek,i was wondering the same that one was really surprising
553,startrek,here you go
554,startrek,here’s raw measurements  i’ll take a look through my tech/blueprint manuals and see if i can find more detailed specs
555,startrek,im fine with an artificial president so long as he doesnt go full landru
556,startrek,filled out including an other answer
557,startrek,nice i just took it a moment ago in case anyone is wondering the survey only takes about 2 minutes or soi wrote in the last question about how star trek has meant different things to me at different ages in my life i would be happy to expand more on that if you want more insight op just let me know
558,startrek,who are you calling a bitch
559,startrek,source kira respected her and no one hates collaborators more than she does
560,startrek,im a sucker for self aware time travel episodes like little green men futures end etc time travel is such a goofy plot device that i you either have to do it *serious* justice as the existential quagmire it is or you have to have fun with it  i prefer the latter especially for a show like trek
561,startrek,done
562,startrek,ah yeah fair enough lot easier over here
563,startrek,1 tng2 ds93 tos4 enterprise5 voyager6 discovery7 picardi have yet to watch any animated trek
564,startrek,ds9tngentvoytosdispictas
565,startrek,sadly we dont get to see the actual negotiations on screen but the talks between weyoun and kai winn on the dominion - bajoran non aggression pact just prior to the war would have been intere3sting;  but all we get is this classic but far too brief scene:  
566,startrek,nothing ruins a person’s credibility faster than referencing major grin as a source of genius
567,startrek,in universe:  they’re peacefulreal world:  creates drama
568,startrek,showing women in such position indeed was progressive but you can do that without having the main character explicitly demean a woman like that there is nothing progressive about how pike treated women on his ship
569,startrek,or the current federation president is an ai hologram of the original one
570,startrek,filled out best of luck to you
571,startrek,i know right  like the only cool part was when picard first hails them and we have that shot of this gigantic ferengi head on the viewscreenthen they beam down to the planet and totally ruin any suspense they had created when it turns out they are a bunch of screechy little goblins with dumb ass laser whips  then that fight scene my god even by star trek standards that was bad  how could anyone watch that episode and think these guys were going to be useful for anything other than cheap laughs
572,startrek,id like to point out that what is now old trek such as tng ds9 etc was once new trek and what greeted with the same criticism thats applied to new trek today
573,startrek,done
574,startrek,sure a lot of the anti-disco complaints is just plain old rage that a black woman is doing the same things that white men did in the past shows this post is no different except it takes the bold new step of ignoring that adira and stamets were the two that did all the work after book handed over the last black box i get it that fact really fucks up the tired “michael does everything” bullshit that people just can’t seem to let go of
575,startrek,if you do want to post it more generally r/samplesize is a good place
576,startrek,&gt; adirathen she had no point to the story
577,startrek,tng ds9tosvoy tasentlower decksdiscopicarddisco and picard are the only two i actively dislike disco makes no sense to me especially season 2 haven’t bothered with season 3 but i think picard butchered the characters and universe more
578,startrek,running through the series against and enjoying it but i am a bit sad we never got to see more of what she likes in her down time almost everybody on the crew had a hobby and other interests but b’elanna didn’t seem to have any interests beyond the warp core and tom unless i’m missing something
579,startrek,for its era just showing women in those positions at all *was* progressive
580,startrek,1 tng/ds9 - fantastic2 tng/ds9 - fantastic3 enterprise - great4 voyager - great5 tos - good but dated  6 picard - bad and highly disappointing7 discovery - one of the worst shows ive ever seen
581,startrek,idk its honestly quite baffling to take solace in that which is kind of my problem with janeway her deciding on whether or not to break the prime directive felt a lot more whimsical than the other captains
582,startrek,agreed voyager is most itself out of the gate the others take time to find themselves voyager will adjust a little along the way but comparatively little
583,startrek,none of that matters because of painful to my eyeballs it is to look at him
584,startrek,i’d watch it
585,startrek,yeah and they could barely use voyager’s techeven with seska’s help no way they figure out how to use the array
586,startrek,yeah they did a pretty good job making it accessible to new people but theres a lot thrown in for the lifers
587,startrek,its the single best line in all of star trek history just edging out good tea nice house and eat any good books lately and theres coffee in that nebula and get the cheese to sickbay and brain and brain what is brain
588,startrek,i suppose belanna s character could have been better explored i dont see why she gets all the hate personally i felt chakotay was insufferable
589,startrek,they said upgrades were done thougheven in the 3100s i guess government work doesnt change :d
590,startrek,if theres an episode of tng that is an its a wonderful life remake its tapestry
591,startrek,i could see it except that bajor is represented as a *very* minor power in the show
592,startrek,agreed i actually really dig the orion prosthetics makes them look more unique and not just like a person covered in green paint
593,startrek,done good luck
594,startrek,indiana
595,startrek,so once again you begin with an personal attack: since i don’t agree i must not understand i do  i think your example of picard is telling it a modern story from the same franchise made almost simultaneously and focusing on one character but one focuses on a beloved especially to this sub character and disco does not so one gets a pass and the other is wistfully and critically compared to television from the 90s the point i was trying to makeindeed the ‘valid criticism’ of the op post has the masthead of a picture of the tng crew you continue to explain to me how it is not like star trek from 30 years ago ya it is not and that is a good thing for a franchise and philosophy that is forward looking”infinite diversity in infinite combinations” as star trek doesn’t have to fit a mold because it is bigger than that but sure the mould is fine with picard though i wonder why two more comments:1 where was this show promoted as an ensemble show i knew i was getting the michael burn show from the first trailer as it focuses on her go back and watch and if it didn’t get if from then i would definitely after the first few shows where you think it was pitched as an ensemble show because it wasn’t from the very first trailer why watch and complain 3 seasons in it is like not liking indian food after walking into an indian restaurant and complaining about how it is not mcdonalds so weird as shout from the roof-tops as pc master race or vegans you just love a thing we get it tng loving sub but you can like other things too try some curry it is good 2 i feel that i know a considerable amount about the characters perhaps more about their personal lives wants quirks and background than i did i the first 3 seasons of definitely tng and mostly ds9 with fewer episodes i think this show goes a long way towards character development of its main cast but perhaps that is just me lastly you are wrong about ‘conscience of the king’ it is not another member of the crew that get obsessed but kirk the show opens with another survivor who is convinced the actor is it is kodos simpsons but is murdered this happens in the first few minutes this obsession is then transferred to kirk o’riley is unaware of kodos mccoy actually yells at kirk about his brooding on revenge in the scene where spock and mccoy confront kirk like the original trailer of disco you should look those up to make sure i am correct the menagerie is a clip show cannibalizing the original pilot so the focus is away from kirk and spock but i would argue the emotional weight of the show is still kirk the puzzle sure spock but as much time if not more is on kirk and what to do about his friend that he has to put to death spock works the slide projector  kirk is still swaggering about in that show too cheers
596,startrek,thats a fair argument and id support the writers if they just didnt want to jump on any land minesbut as you pointed out they did already broach the issue by having a prominent trans characterand if youre going to discuss something potentially controversial then you need to discuss iti just dont think the gender sensitivity issue is nearly as important as the misogyny issue thats what the discussion about problematic orions has always been about before
597,startrek,ah dukat not only will he occupy your world and enslave your people while trying to gaslight you into thinking its for your own good hell also bang your mom just to make his point
598,startrek,done i love surveys
599,startrek,we only get 13 episodes  no room for filler episodes where crusher has sex with a ghost or the doctor introduces opera to a whole civilization of little people
600,startrek,is there a question he fired the disruptor then lied about it
601,startrek,right i always felt that by interfering on behalf of the ocampa after the caretaker died she was altering their destiny and the kazon’s destiny voyager didn’t kill the caretaker and their actions didn’t effect anyone until they destroyed the array it’s always been my opinion that the only reason voyager was stranded in the delta quadrant was because janeway violated the prime directive change my mind lol
602,startrek,characters like that exist in all the shows
603,startrek,picard end of discussion next
604,startrek,tumblr has a very active star trek fandom but i would imagine the demographics are quite different to reddit i’d recommend posting it there too tbh
605,startrek,enterprise-c was taken by time aliens on its way back to narendra iii i cant exactly remember but i was very cynical about the entire mission but there is a point where you walk across a long docking arm with windows as youre walking into the enterprise-c the ship is so huge and gets closer and closer it was a very cool moment in an otherwise meh side mission i wasnt a huge fan of st:o and stopped playing mostly because the grind was very tiresome gotta pay to have continuous fun in that game i thought it was worth checking out though
606,startrek,done good luck on your dissertation
607,startrek,and that is one of the reason why endgame is one of the worst episodes of the showthats not being professional that just means everyone is just dead inside
608,startrek,i have enjoyed dis throughout though i certainly think s2 was better than s1 and s3 is better than s2the thing i keep in mind with regards to comparing the quality of early seasons of the shows is that tng had a 26 episode season 1 and a 22 episode season 2 thats 48 episodes before we even get to season 3 where people generally say that the show picked up ds9 had 46 episodes for its first 2 seasons i liked s3 but worf doesnt show up til 4x01 and i know people who consider this to be when ds9 picked up voyager had 42 episodes for its first 2 seasons when do people say voyager picked up 7 of 9 again thats basically s4 enterprise had a whopping 52 episodes in its first 2 seasons then we get to the xindi arcdiscovery has had 41 episodes air in total so far 15+14+12 in my book discovery found its feet the quickest among all of them\*\*subject to personal taste
609,startrek,whats her number  let me try
610,startrek,voy tng tos ds9
611,startrek,lazy response to a lazy post but for real: it’s sketchy as fuck that “the black lady is good” is the central theme for the complaints about discovery the sheer rage at directed at michael for being the main character is disgusting
612,startrek,ok burnham didnt do anything alone either  she was the center but had alot of help along the way toobtw some of the best acting in all series was done by avery brooks in that episode where he recruits garak  i would say he had the best acting scenes of any captain
613,startrek,i guess theres just too much money being thrown at it that theyre burning 8+mil per episode and cant structure the writing staff is amazing in this day and age any other show wouldve been canned and not renewed for season 2 its the flagship show though so theyve got to save face i guess is the constant change in showrunners a symptom or a cause though bit of both maybe &gt; that being said i do think its a miracle that the show is as good as it is considering the tumultuous situation behind the scenesi both agree and disagree with you the bones of a good show are easily there and it has the budget and profile to do some really amazing things the hot mess that is the constant change in directions as we cycle through showrunners is only made more apparent by this though it will be interesting to see what michelle paradise can do with season 4 if she keeps the job thatll be the first season thats been set up by the same showrunner and isnt carrying the previous baggage honestly though its 2020 and the expanse can hit its stride by episode 4 on less than half the budget so waiting for season 4 is a bit of a stretch
614,startrek,as i recall she didnt disregard his claims either as soon as hed left her office she ordered starfleet intelligence to investigate granted given who was in charge it wasnt going to go anywhere but she didnt know that
615,startrek,im sorry i didnt read the post just wanted to say i hate belanna
616,startrek,because shes not vulcan so hasnt had the emotional teaching that a human should have
617,startrek,oh i like paris i always enjoyed the development of friendship with ensign kim but chakotay couldve been executed *so* much better i believe i read somewhere that even his actor began to dislike the character for being so one-dimensional though i dont have a source available to back this up i might be remembering wrong either way it often feels like being native american is the only character trait he has not always he has his moments but it happens
618,startrek,id argue riker cooking eggs is the turning point season 2 crew reporting in
619,startrek,but they were raiders why go out hunting for ships when you can pull them to you
620,startrek,im also watching both i so badly want ossyra to evolve in future seasons to a dukat style antagonist
621,startrek,yes i mean with disco you can really go away and pretend it is a complete different universe/future but picard is trying to be right on the lore and beeing serious but it fails miserably
622,startrek,i think they’re referring to cbs allaccess which is a extra service many americans are buying just for star trek previous star trek was available on rabbit ears for free  in my country i imagine it was in the us as well
623,startrek,voyager has a character who is in 124 episodes three times the amount of episodes than michael burnham has appeared in but their name is said 3 times throughout the entire run
624,startrek,&gt; shows no longer have the luxury of having a few shaky seasonsif this were true discovery would already be cancelled
625,startrek,its a show that kept getting more incoherent as more things happened
626,startrek,i read netflix all the way through and was really confused
627,startrek,agreed  in tng he was always this mercurial unpredictable presence  picard could never quite figure out if he was friend or foe or what his true agenda was  in voyager he became just the annoying but relatively harmless uncle
628,startrek,* tng - 10/10* ds9 - 9/10* voyager - 6/10* tos - 4/10* enterprise - 1/10ratings are based on scale that assumes that one series must be best and one series must be worst so take that for what it is in regards to enterprise i’m also deliberately omitting the current-era productions because they are still incomplete
629,startrek,he died without fear he was no longer slave a great writing arche will be missed the actor that played him did an excellent jobepisode 12 was incredible
630,startrek,discovery has a 13 episode run  about half the run of a normal season  no room for filler plot linesbut we still got a mudd episode  emperor georgiou send off 2 parter and other plot lines starring someone else im sure if disco had 20+ episodes to work with we would get a rhys bryce and owo episode
631,startrek,voyager really stretched the plot logic of the star trek universe which is saying something because it was stretched pretty thin to starti forgave it for death wish because it was actually a really cool episode but they should have made it a one off that civil war episode was just ridiculous  the only way that it can make any sense at all is if when they enter the &gt;continuum they literally temporarily become q themselves  and that raises some pretty important questions&lt;
632,startrek,i dont mind it as long as it isnt there for the sake of it
633,startrek,no judgment just curious: why do you rate tng so low
634,startrek,dont get me wrong i love ent
635,startrek,especially great since they had a setting and side characters they could keep developing slowly leeta in particular was just a dabbo girl that they liked bringing back
636,startrek,yeah look up some of the news on it in recent monthsexciting🟨🟦🟥
637,startrek,you nailed it in those episodes were specifically comparing the klingon way of life to the federation sisco and picard didnt have jurisdiction were not supposed to like dax and worfs decisions janeways decision to incorporate the makee were laid out was she supposed to keep them in the brig for 70 years
638,startrek,i didnt realize that - absolutely great news  thanks for sharing that
639,startrek,tough one probably:ds9tngentdscvoyldxpicbut there is a caveat ds9 is way off in top spot but the next 3 are very close together tng will always be second but marginally i was never really a fan of voy but i dont dislike it it just isnt one i go for to scratch a trek itch ldx &amp; pic are works in progress so they could change i enjoyed both of them despite their issues especially for the latter but it was by no means bad
640,startrek,strange new worlds will air in 2022about pike spock and their adventures on the enterprise
641,startrek,if she broke them in the first episode she would never have had to break them another time since theyd all be home
642,startrek,what if hes the voyager emh
643,startrek,i agree  picard was a total disappointment
644,startrek,this scene was already submitted by u/treefox -- here is my point of view on why the dis one is superior:&gt;the scene with the sheliak was great but it was resolved with a quick gimmick: picard finding a loophole in the rules and relying on the sheliak to honour it despite their best interest yes it was established earlier in the episode that the sheliaks were extreme sticklers for rules but it still feels forced to me and requires slightly too much suspension of disbelief
645,startrek,it is a testament to how great tos is that after 50+ years it still scores near enough the same as the most recent seriesobviously the sets/ tech and effects lower tos score whereas the stories acting characters though-provoking nature of each episode still keep it as a fan favouriteit is amazing really🟨🟦🟥
646,startrek,shes popped up every now and then the actor only wants a bit part on the show
647,startrek,regarding tas: anything that old is primarily going to have reviews by people who are already fans note: there are only 16 critics ratings picard has more than five times that many you cant really do a direct comparison from different eras and draw solid conclusions from it
648,startrek,i remember the episode where quark gets shot as part of a coverup protecting bajoran collaborators he showed great technical aptitude when breaking in i think that his development was just more and more people realizing how good of an engineer he is i mean he realized that the station was being turned into a giant anti-chronoton laser before o’brien did where does that come up in training
649,startrek,agreed  its dead easy to write dystopia and darkness and keep the audiences attention  trying to find ways to tell a story in a utopian society takes a lot more work  and sometimes often the stories fail but at least you can usually see what they were going for
650,startrek,im glad you really like doscovery  there are certainly some  really good things about the show to enjoy  pike was absolutely one of my favorites too  id really enjoy a spinoff show about the enterprise under his command
651,startrek,this is a great point the future represented in star trek was always one you *wanted to live in* that didnt mean it didnt get dark  ds9 was about a massive galactic war  but even then ds9 felt like a future that we wanted and that *was* worth fighting for  the dominion war worked precisely because of thati miss having an aspirational sci fi franchise
652,startrek,the oddest thing about that is that in season 1 of tng almost everyone seems rude and hostile to each other
653,startrek,&gt;both sides had an unspoken agenda that they werent able to push by simply lyinggreat point the you cannot lie but you can achieve a lot of misdirection just by omission angle was a novel one and provided additional depth to the scene and especially to its conclusion
654,startrek,now i feel even worse for obrien
655,startrek,there is a lot of truth in what you write look at the recent battlestar g series stunning writing and character development and from what i remember the seasons were not that long and look at any good tv series such as the closer or house good writers are pure essential gold it is a shame about discovery no need for that kind of treatment but the responsibility has to go to the top who are running producing iton a side note i bought a hd season of enterprise and it is not even up to the level of old vhs i feel very cheated by the review on the technical merits
656,startrek,no none of the four actors who have played pike have been wheelchair users
657,startrek,a little more sophisticated nails it   i was happy with the resolution to the earth riders for a few moments but it felt very contrieved because why the hell didnt they talk to each other periodically even if titan went to do its thing its still humans and neighbours   to defend earth youd want to keep an eye on everything between pluto and the sun surely   the humans also were absolutely unwilling to compromise until georgiou took the helmet off howd she know that would help and they saw it was humans   it gave me the feeling that if it were an alien race humans wouldnt have backed off to make peace
658,startrek,got that and makes sense - but this is no emergency situazion here saru has all the time in the world during the refit to either get a suitable commander or get tilly on a real career path leading there
659,startrek,that’s good for you that you enjoyed discovery i watch it too but for me it is like seeing a bad accident and i can not look away the amount of plotholes bad writing and stupid decisions by the characters keeps my eyes rolling
660,startrek,&gt; theyve really emphasized saying their names and flashing to them but aside from detmer none of them have roles that are clearly defined• detmer: helm  • owosekun: operations  • bryce: communications  • rhys: tactical• nilsson: spore drive operationsnone of it is the least big vague
661,startrek,
662,startrek,done gg
663,startrek,love janeway she is my favorite captaini found that she mainly broke the temporal prime directive she was pretty darn good with keeping to the federations rules unless time travel was involved
664,startrek,i would say buying a ticket for a star trek movie counts as youre spending money on star trekthats actually all the spending ive done into darkness my wife bought me a spock figure for christmas though
665,startrek,most of the “true fans” who have youtube channels and blogs just want season 4 of tng and or ds9 copied and repeated over and over and any divergence from that formula is an assault on what they’re owed  they also all known better as evidenced by their successful careers in hollywood
666,startrek,you know it cant be an hologram if it isnt flickering every 2 seconds or so
667,startrek,whats a hebitian
668,startrek,thank you
669,startrek,garak was also never a member of the crew and no one ever really truly trusted him or toasted how good a person he was
670,startrek,i love disco and look forward to new episodes each week i actually love that it is very different that the shows proceeding it variety is the spice of life after allas i’ve mentioned before i think disco’s fist two seasons where setting up the series to really shine in the distant future now we are getting the tng-styles shows plus a great story arc revolving around the origin of the burn and i must addohmygoodness isn’t booker’s ship cray-cray
671,startrek,someone should really have told neelix about the half your age plus 7 rule
672,startrek,ds9tngenterprisethe orvilletosvoyagerdiscoverypicard
673,startrek,thanks for mentioning this i just watched it that guys voice is pretty insufferable but i really enjoyed his ironic takedown of std
674,startrek,ds9 &gt; tng &gt; tos &gt; voy &gt; ent &gt; everything elseds9 and tng are neck and neck some days i might put tng first the gulf between ent and the rest is massive on the other hand
675,startrek,presumably they have not updated the fire suppression systems in the jefferies tubes to 32nd century tech yet doubt it was high on the list which would make it a pre-tos era system
676,startrek,yeah and it would have been - advanced race interfering cant factor into every decision a starfleet captain ever makes because nothing would ever get done the kazon had no replicator technology no transporters and no working knowledge of federation or caretaker technology add multiple photons set to timed detonation  that thing would have been gone and they would have been home
677,startrek,paris did get demoted to ensign tho
678,startrek,ah yes of course y’see he does have his uses
679,startrek,if it makes you feel any better think of it as the equivalent of a teenager being in a relationship with a man in his 40sand if that isnt enough think back to what her equivalent age would have been when they first got together at some point before the pilot
680,startrek,if i was on the cusp of a possible conflict with a powerful enemy and some unfrozen dipshit was bugging me about his stock portfolio id probably be a little short with them too
681,startrek,tuvix was am abomination that wanted to kill nellix and tuvok whom janeway was responsible for and known for 20 years in tuvoks case the humane thing would have been inducing a coma immediately until thier crew could have been separated that was her mistakes but he had to go
682,startrek,you: federalme a trekkie: federatious
683,startrek,this  there were a *lot* of problems with picard but patrick stewart might have been able to save it if they had made any attempt at all to have him be picard  i dont know if the blame is more on stewart himself or the writers but luckily there is plenty to go around
684,startrek,there are two shows coming out and both of them had their introduction on discovery strange new worlds for pike &amp; co section 31 spinoff for georgiou her split from the discovery ship/crew took up a lot more time though i dont mind the character but she reminded me of having an oh shit button in a video game that always saves the day the last two episodes would have went very differently if the crew still had that oh shit button of a character hanging around
685,startrek,that was future evil-admiral janeway
686,startrek,i was thinking that as i was watching it or at the very least a thermal regenerator
687,startrek,first five that came in to my head it’s not supposed to be an exhaustive list
688,startrek,could be guinan
689,startrek,precisely why vance was right to tell her to pound sand if she wasnt going to give herself up
690,startrek,yea but thats only 5 at a stretch out of a 26 episode season thats not a great turn around
691,startrek,no daphne ashbrook who played meloradoes not
692,startrek,that doesnt mean the federation has to - or should be expected to - cave to every concession she wants she hijacks a starship invades hq under false pretenses and vance should just sign whatever crap she shoves in front of him how does it help the federation to be perceived as being in cooperation with a feared gang of slave traders osyrra simply saying oh no its fine well stop doing that is not even close to good enough even if she isnt lying
693,startrek,1 ds92 dis3 tng4 ent5 ld6 pic7 voy8 tosi can have any series on in the background to watch i do enjoy them all but voyager has the lowest number of good episodes across 7 seasons i found tos outdated and barely watchable in the 90s and whilst there are a few stellar episodes it’s not something i ever go back to
694,startrek,that was a more general problem with voyagerunless a civilisation had faster than warp travel technology we should only have met any given individual once and there should have been very little connection to anyone on the crew for anything they stumbled uponthat coincidence of meeting the exact guy who genocided that moon was just one of many on a list that included meeting the aliens who created chakotays fake native american heritage the humans whod been kidnapped from half a galaxy away and any of the other earth-centric episodes
695,startrek,1tng2ds93lower decks4 discovery &amp; voyager5 enterprise &amp; picard6tos &amp; tas
696,startrek,yeah data shot fajo just as he was beamed away and when riker asked him about the detected weapons discharge my last comment is what data said probably the closest data ever comes to lying when hes not under the influence of some nefarious third party aside from that one episode where he lies under orders to try and keep the crew from returning to that one system with the powerful xenophobic aliens
697,startrek,neelix comes across as a guy without many options who had to do what he had to do to survive: he had to kiss a lot of ass and do a lot of things to show he was useful and earn his keep  he couldnt have a bad day and piss off the crew so he errored on the side of annoying
698,startrek,this post was  because you have a new account and we get a lot of spam from newly created accounts if your post is not spam please send a message to the mods **with the url of this post** letting them know so they can fix it for you llap*i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit/message/compose/to=/r/startrek if you have any questions or concerns*
699,startrek,its gonna blow up in their faces next episode when tilly miraculously does something that saves the ship  just a guess
700,startrek,everyone accepts that tv is done differently now no one accepts that as an excuse for abysmal writing
701,startrek,so you might not think discussing this is insensitive  i dont either but it is a sensitive subject because a lot of people have very strong feelings wrapped up with this i just think that theres no chance that the writers would touch on that sort of subject for fear of upsetting some very vocal people that they really want on their side i am not trying to argue either way on the ins and outs of the situation i simply think that the star trek writers wont touch on it
702,startrek,done   good luck
703,startrek,yes but there were also episodes those characters are barely even in  as someone else pointed out ds9 had multiple episodes devoted entirely to the freaking ferengi bartender  tng had episodes where brent spiner was the star co star and guest star at the same timevoyager made multiple terrible chakotay episodes in a desperate attempt to get the actor to quit the show
704,startrek,then lies about it yeah great acting saul rubinek crushes that part
705,startrek,now knowing how off everything is makes the scenes very cringey for me i cant even watch them
706,startrek,season 1 janeway sure as the series went on though she was just done with this shit she had coffee for blood and was doing whatever it took if it meant making her temporal affairs 2nd worst offender after james t kirk then so be it  honestly thats what i love about her
707,startrek,from the user history it seems to be fandom in general
708,startrek,i feel its dated no quantum communications or computing no lasers as weapons even though they would be a strong choice to use cold war bs etc and the anarchists planets alliance not its actual name arc is just not very believablethat being said its much much much better than uh*other concurrent shows* \*wink\* well worth a watch
709,startrek,i just filled it good luck live long and prosper 🖖
710,startrek,its fandom generally but as a big star trek its gonna an important part to me
711,startrek,yeah  i actually felt for him my whole life is over there :
712,startrek,there is some scholarship on this topic notably the article no ramps in space : the inability to envision accessibility in star trek: deep space nine by hanley e kanar: 
713,startrek,&gt; the acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force of our lives we work to better ourselves and the rest of humanitydont conflate capitalism with greed  that quote could equally describe a super wealthy philanthropist - keeping with my interpretation that everyone is functionally super wealthy in trek
714,startrek,advanced diplomacy even picard might not have pulled that off
715,startrek,i think the blast was disabled during transport
716,startrek, 1 voy / ds92 tng / ent / tos movies3 tos / short treks / tng movies4 dsc / lds5 pic6 7 8 9 jj reboot movies
717,startrek,it reminds me of a band with terrible music that go on stage and act like van halen on stage oblivious that the audience is not really having fun
718,startrek,its not really insensitiveno one denies the duality of biology vs identity  you can be genetically female and not identify with your sex assigned at birth - the whole concept of transgenderism kinda requires that really
719,startrek,he was one button away from murdering his own brother but everybody was like thats just rom
720,startrek,did you watch the episode where osyrra literally states the emerald chain practises capitalismand that parts of the federation have been practising capitalism for 100 years
721,startrek,its definitely *not* a word in reality but i like it too
722,startrek,seems like with all the other crazy stuff they can get away with in trek they could have used the patterns in the transporter from tuvok and neelix and somehow kept all three  i think he would have been a great addition
723,startrek,what im saying is that the array had to be destroyed with absolute certainty if you are using a timed bomb you are relying on chance way too much someone with superior technology may swoop in and steal the arrays crucial tech like sevens hypothesis that i mentioned or the kazon may be able to defuse the bomb in time it may even fail to go off on its ownthe best option i can think of is to leave someone behind in chakotays ship but again what are they gonna do in the case of one of those outcomes
724,startrek,spoiler tag please
725,startrek,and they get less of a send off than georgio did
726,startrek,what do you mean by specific fees - are you saying netflix subscriptionsurely to watch any other star trek series youd need to pay for whatever tv service youd use in the uk at least amazon prime+netflix is far cheaper than sky or whatever and theres none of those dumbass advert breaks
727,startrek,getting rid of kes did a lot of good for the show in general
728,startrek,done
729,startrek,to add to that ive felt that after being paired with him 90% of her story revolved around that relationship instead of herself
730,startrek,&gt;detmer is the helmsman but so is owo kindai got the sense that detmer is sulu and owo is chekov but minus any guns helm and navigator but im an idiot so please feel free to totally disagree i dont feel strongly about this comparison just sharing my sense of it
731,startrek,i liked it i thought it helped explain a lot
732,startrek,haha yeah what a weird thing to say  i think maybe they were trying to defend the actress but just expressed themselves poorly
733,startrek,done 👍
734,startrek,good luck on your dissertation interested in seeing the results when you post them
735,startrek,absolutely agree and i think the best way to explore that would have been to take her explosive relationship to seven and have them notice their similarities difficult parental relations being half of human half not and learning to deal with that the stubborness and so on it would also have created a mccoy spock kind of friendship with the snarkiness and teasing but actually caring
736,startrek,
737,startrek,&gt;the sweet dulcet tones of vic fontainei just woke up my dog laughing that was great i know you didnt mean it to be funny but the way you mixed vic and kenny g really made me laugh thanks and enjoy your weekend
738,startrek,after living most of her life as a borg drone being forcefully ripped away from the collective the the federation and then seeing the federation turn on former borg drones seven of nine turned out to not be a perfect well-adjusted person i for one am shocked
739,startrek,rom com
740,startrek,im a big fan of discovery i really enjoyed season 1 season 2 was alright and i love season 3 but i am a little tired of michael burnham and only michael saves the day its improved this season but theres still too much focus on herthere are entire episodes of the other series where the lead didnt play a prominent role and sometimes those were the best episodes
741,startrek,federatious definition make them borg go loco
742,startrek,tngds9tosdiscopicardldvoyent
743,startrek,see i always liked tom i always skipped kim episodes both of them and its not a reflection on wang but i just never really like the character
744,startrek,fat jokes arent cool
745,startrek,dude the actor who played the psycho holo is sooooo good in those types of roles i remember seeing him in the bone collector and i was like yep totally him
746,startrek,i believe “not helping” does in fact amount to genocide especially if you go out of your way to create a cure only to withhold it because you don’t understand the basics of evolution
747,startrek,she was also loyal to her crew in the end as opposed to sacrificing them for an outsider
748,startrek,is the subject strictly star trek or fandom generally
749,startrek,klingon birds of prey occasionally appear in wacky scales too
750,startrek,that time he stopped the falling turbolift by turning his arms into metal was pretty eye opening  like damn odo
751,startrek,i dont mean drop entirely but their trip through borg space is done in what season 4  and they still have several borg episodes/queen moments even though the queen says numerous times that she isnt interested in voyager
752,startrek,distillation no fallacy
753,startrek,oh right well the more i know since i knew none of this
754,startrek,1 ds92 tng3 tos4 voy5 lower decks6 pici haven’t watch discovery or tas so they’re absent from this list
755,startrek,klingons eat half their food alive its no wonder they dont really care for replicators
756,startrek,ive thought about that too  obviously their mass isnt constant between forms  how big can a changeling become  can linked changelings make a joined form   could the entire great link turn itself into a planet  or some sort of gigantic monsterso many questions
757,startrek,ive rewatched picard already ive not as yet rewatched discovery i dont rewatch individual episodes though i do a complete rewatch from start to finish that being the case i dont like rewatching a show while there is a current season on the go i might give discovery a rewatch after season 3 ends it rather depends on how much new  content is out there and whether there is room for a rewatch before season 4 kicks off
758,startrek,no that’s not a hot take it’s been done to death it would’ve been a fine post without the “hot take” introduction toothat said i think you’re wrong all captains are products of their environment and situation picard left starfleet because of the ideals he thought they should represent that’s outfederationing the federationarcher and pike come to mind as paragons of virtue too even sisko but he was a war captain and showed what happens when you really pressure the federation they’re all different faces but no more or less federationnow if you’re going to say janeway took the most risk upholding those ideals maybe other captains have risked their lives and ships for those ideals too
759,startrek,youre approaching it with hindsight at the time and given all the knowledge and resources they had they could have used a timer on some photon torpedos think dark frontier and then set the array to send them all home
760,startrek,i think there was also a character on ds9 whos actress needed a wheelchair
761,startrek,theres  a 1:1400 ent-d it comes out to about 16 long or so if youre looking for any models wwwscalematescom can help you determine if they exist and who makes it
762,startrek,its interesting that you ask about merch and other content where do you place going to watch movies in cinemaseither way im not a super fan but i do own merch and have gifted merch several times when people like a franchise its great to know which gifts will always be appreciated
763,startrek,it did cause him pain but we know that was a drawback he was willing to accept in the episode you referenced s2 e5 he was offered either optical devices that would function similarly to the visor but with less performance or a potentially risky medical procedure that would give him normal eyesight and he turned down both options
764,startrek,&gt;after retiring from starfleet he became a famous ~~writer~~ user of erotic holo fiction
765,startrek,perhaps something occurred during transport commander
766,startrek,federatious is my new favorite word that i didn’t know existed i’ll use it with reckless abandon
767,startrek,yes i agree im not that big of a picard fan but its fine because enjoying tng doesnt hinge on the fact that you have to like him
768,startrek,or just poke a big stick into them as they materialize
769,startrek,it has its flaws but so does every series except ds9 ds9 is literally perfect dont at me the most recent episode was among my favorite in all of nutrek the one thing that was a huge misfire for me this season was continually trying to make me sympathize for space hitler but thankfully that seems to be all done with now
770,startrek,especially with that shuck and jive huggy bear-style character they added for no explicable reason
771,startrek,star trek is pretty legendary for having terrible fight choreography
772,startrek,kira/keiko situation
773,startrek,im thinking of the communications array found in voyager which was powered solely by singularities it generated a massive amount of energy equivalent to 100 suns or something like that
774,startrek,&gt;burn hamlol  i do hate how she says her name
775,startrek,theres a regular character who sort of fills that role - though i think the actress is persian rather than from israel but i have not checked  he only shows up a couple times a season liaising with her
776,startrek,well at last i bet it choose an hologram conversations with human is better when they have someone to look at
777,startrek,having seen wicked the makeup for elphaba was so much betterat first i thought the supervisor on that junk planet was an automaton of some kind because of how artificial he looked
778,startrek,you assume correctly
779,startrek,if at any point i got fed up and thought of quitting watching jeffrey combs coming to the show would definitely make me change my mind
780,startrek,the omega particle too
781,startrek,&amp;#x200b;1 tng2 ds93 tos4 enterprise5 picard 6 voyager7 lower decks / animated series8 discoverysidenote: picard was very disappointing and for the lower 5 series i went with percentage of episodes i liked excluding scenes; i liked nepenthe in its entirety thats 10 percent of picard and i fully enjoyed like 5 episodes of voyager out \~170 and thats roughly 3% i found myself enjoying lower decks but that enjoyment was overshadowed by my annoyance of lower decks being canon
782,startrek,a couple of coworkers who are more emotionally intelligent than most people absolutely concur that if one were to fill out the perfect job requisition for a top engineer “on the spectrum” would be in there they would absolutely not be a lead engineer but someone who would be given tasks with schedule and budget and they would produce every single time
783,startrek,the one thing that bothered me about voyager is that neelix seemed to know everythingoh we just happened to come across the guy who nuked neelixs planetdespite traveling light-years away and thousands of other talaxians in the area also that episode reminded me to much of dr mora
784,startrek,after retiring from starfleet he became a famous writer of erotic holo fiction
785,startrek,1 tos2 tng3 ds94 voy5 dis6 pic7 ent
786,startrek,good answer  dont grok why the mods decided to hide it
787,startrek,i still feel that in this particular episode the point of those people who got the omega particle in the first place i don’t remember their name should have been explored more deeplythey said their civilisation was on the brink of annihilation without the omega particlethat dilemma wasn’t really addressed enough i think
788,startrek,a brief primer on federation history between the 24th and 32nd centuries narrated and shown by the guardian would be cool
789,startrek,with their casting of someone not smart for that character i think the writers intended for her to never learn anything  you should have more faith in the show runners
790,startrek,oh the episode where data almost kills the guythats just good trek
791,startrek,&gt;never shows us these thingswhich breaks the first rule of story telling to show dont tell  of course with who they cast for burn ham they have to resort to being more explicit since they dont have an actor that can do a good job of that
792,startrek,in the voyager conspiracy seven believed that during the explosion a cloaked ship may have stolen the arrays reactor which can be used to catapult ships across the galaxy so a bomb and a timer wouldnt do the job if such a thing was possiblevoyager had to make sure that the array was destroyed and no one got to it before that
793,startrek,i love the expanse too and it has a disgusting main character naomi that reminds me so much unfortunately of burn ham
794,startrek,all your scenes were very good i didnt remember the into darkness ones i might have to rewatch the movie the scene with the sheliak was great but it was resolved with a quick gimmick: picard finishing a loophole in the rules and relying on the sheliak to honour it despite their best interest yes it was establish earlier in the episode that the sheliaks were extreme sticklers for rules but it still feels forced to me and requires slightly to much suspension of disbeliefi also love the kidnapped lwaxana scene but its a comedy negotiation it works only if you accept that the ferengi is a moronwhat both those two scenes have in common is that they dont play like both parties are equally capable and smart and coherently follow their objective  also in both scenes both parties objectives are explicit and very simplein the vance/osyraa scene both are credible actors smart and true to their interests their objectives are complex and not necessarily explicit osyraa for example wants at least three things:* to better the economic prosperity of the chain threatened by the shortage of dilythium* to enter the partnership with the federation being the stronger/dominant of the two parties* to maintain her personal power and ensure her legacythe khan scene from id is good and credible but its a little one sided: its basically khan lasting out why he is in a stronger posiyon and spock conceding btw did you mean to link the same scene twice
795,startrek,janeway did too massacred lots if 8472 with a bio weapon to help the borg
796,startrek,i agree with the best of trek/worst of trek comparisonbut feel that the proportion of lower quality content is often just too high
797,startrek,where do you study
798,startrek,well thats interesting i guess the blacklist wanted someone from israeli descent and they got him to be the mossad agent
799,startrek,for nothing more than gore shock value
800,startrek,we should start a drinking game with this question
801,startrek,i think the purest expression of the roddenberry vision was probably season 1 of tng and nobody thinks that was much good
802,startrek,i once met a guy at a party he immediately announced he was gay like it was a defining characteristic of his personality no it was the most boring talk to me of your hopes and dreams you’re philosophy not what’s between your legs or how you use it
803,startrek,tngvoyagerdeep space 9picardtosenterprisediscovery
804,startrek,those are all good episodes
805,startrek,head of coe
806,startrek,it just wasn’t meant to be
807,startrek,he also has a recurring role as a mossad agent in the blacklist
808,startrek,where is the hatred really who do i hate i have a gay brother a muslim girlfriend my point isn’t that these people are less valid because of their characteristics i’m saying that they are playing to wrong audience if they put these people in a wwe championship that would be stunning and brave to do it in star trek is very much preaching to the converted and in some ways is regressive like morgan freeman says the best way to stop racism is to stop talking about it to bring it up tirelessly in star trek is like redundant with a cost to the story and is insulting to the audience but to even bring this stuff up in 2021 i am the bigot despite being watching and loving star trek since i was a young child there comes a point where the sjw nonsense goes a step too far
809,startrek,1 ds92 discovery3 tos4 lower decks5 voyager6 picard7 enterprise8 tngnever seen tas even though i do want to get around to it at some point
810,startrek,because michael is the main character the only main character every other actor on the show is a supporting character its an intentional choice woven into the fabric of the show theres nothing to be fixed - anymore than saying tng needs to be fixed because it had 7 main characters instead of 3 like tosthe people actually enjoying dsc dont want your fixes
811,startrek,that would have been far preferable to what weve gotten
812,startrek,to each their own i thought that was the only interesting scene the character ever had lol
813,startrek,oh wow til janet kidder is also wearing a bunch of prosthetics as well as green paint her nose and forehead look so different
814,startrek,hes also really good at making those extended federatious speeches about goodness and duty and stuff so much so that he has to be told to shut up on occasion see: detmer
815,startrek,well thank god starfleet now has a crew from the kirk era around theyll know the lost art of talking a computer into committing suicide
816,startrek,thats some proper trekkie knowledge right there
817,startrek,&gt;yeah people seem to forget even tng stumbled over hurdles during the first two seasons   i doubt it as its constantly brought up especially in threads about discovery
818,startrek,hey dude calm down there is no need to take the hatred to this extreme chill out a bit and people will take your points a bit more seriously
819,startrek,michael is the main character in the show it isnt an ensemble it was never intended to be an ensemble this has been stated multiple times by multiple showrunnersother characters do get their moments to shine but they are still supporting characters and michael as the sole main character will always be front and centre
820,startrek,&gt;tillys princess friend last seasonyou mean queen me hani ika hali ka po
821,startrek,here from tng times
822,startrek,yikes thats worse i got mixed with how long ocampans live
823,startrek,\&gt;  sure there are some things that niggle me but it took me years to rewatch voyager as janeway annoyed me so much the first 2 seasons and arguably the 3rd season of tng were not much good either i dont think the comparisons to weaker first seasons of other shows hold up tng or ds9 never fundamentally changed what star trek was about in terms of world building the ensemble cast and especially the overall message discovery and picard arguably does that and the weak writing have made that show unwatchable to mealso youre saying the third season of tng isnt good not the kind of positivity id be willing to swallow quite honestly
824,startrek,&gt;	they could have cut a lot of chakotay and paris in favor of more b’elannaparis yeah chakotay… he got a few early native american episodes but after that his character was barely explored at all whereas the paris/torres relationship was explored *a lot* not annoyingly so imo but at the cost of knowing others lessharry kim faintly waves in the background
825,startrek,1 the antennae were cauterized we only have one reference to antennae growing back and it was in the context of a clean slice2 they can warp but dilithium is limited limited the range of their vessels3 the sphere data makes it so that discovery wouldnt let herself be destroyed intentionally the ship could still be destroyed by an outside force it isnt magic
826,startrek,it was a terminal case of lazy writingshe could have just rigged a bunch of tri-cobald-charges inside the installation and hooked them up to a timerthe writers wanted her to make a noble choice but where to lazy to think of anything to force that choice so they just tossed her the idiot ball
827,startrek,i like what theyre going for aesthetically - the orion males have these exaggerated masculine features and the females have a statuesque quality to them it fits with them being this matriarchy of chads and powerful women i think the orions they had in s1 on the klingon homeworld were done in the more traditional green paint style and it didnt feel like enough not with the cameras theyre using now
828,startrek,she was 2 years old
829,startrek,the portable holo-emitter was brought back from the future voyager crew encountered a time traveller who had it if memory serves moriarty wouldn’t have had access to that they’ve always managed to fire up old damaged ships in the past so i imagine there’s still enough power left in the circuits to backup the hard drive my head canon tells me that the ships memory logs etc are protected like a black box so it can be salvaged
830,startrek,this is all true but is it really an impossible feat to endear side-characters to an audience in 15 episodes 40 minutes is a long time to fill and there seems to be a constant stream of conscious decisions to fill that time up with melodrama and artificial gravitas haha that was avoided in the previous serieses it could be that they just want to do *so much more* now that they have the budget and technology to amp up every moment but we lose out on the relatability even the humanity of the crew when they do so
831,startrek,geordies visor was notorious for causing him pain he had to have it adjusted frequently iirc the implants were available as early as season 2 as i believe pulaski mentions them
832,startrek,you misspelled broccoli
833,startrek,“serious sci-fi” is a very interesting term to use to describe star trek a universe that basically tells science to fck off in every scene of the show it’s almost completely made up of fake science both lower decks and the other star treks so how do you mean it’s not “serious sci-fi”
834,startrek,thanks so much love the look and design of your list very cool
835,startrek,tngds9voyentldxtospicdis
836,startrek,dsc hasnt held on to a showrunner long enough for any plan to be fully executedbryan fuller left before the series premiered - his contributions went up to the mirror universe arc which was then shortened and the klingon war arc reimagined and closed down in the s1 finaleaaron harberts and gretchen berg took over for s15 and lasted until s25 before being firedalex kurtzman then ran the remainder of season 2 and theres a noticeable shift in the story in the back half of the season compared to the firstmichelle paradise took over for season 3 and given that shes lasted an entire season she is now the longest-serving showrunner on discoveryseason 3 also marks the first season of dsc without a showrunner change mid-way through the storyit should come as no surprise that dsc is lacking in consistency on-screen when you take into consideration that there have been 5 showrunners in 3 seasons that being said i do think its a miracle that the show is as good as it is considering the tumultuous situation behind the scenes
837,startrek,because my dissertation is on fandom i am sort of seeking out people who are going to be biased but im doing other surveys to get a wider range or responsesthanks for the feedback
838,startrek,i know right im glad op made this post becauae im also *still* enjoying discovery and ive been a fan for decades
839,startrek,it really was such a good episode
840,startrek,i too was turned off by that first episode after just a couple of minutes which was strange given how it has been praised as a progressive show eventually stated watching it again recently it’s not too bad for its time
841,startrek,as is who watches the watchers which may be the single most trekkian episode of the entire franchise and my favorite
842,startrek,shortened season formats don’t automatically mean giving up on character development the little moments we’re talking about are the basic building blocks to any well-rounded show outside of star trek these character moments are everywhere even in more popular golden age of tv series like the boys and the queen’s gambit i look at what the expanse is doing right now and every week i find it amazing how much better quality it is compared to discovery discovery wants to compete for the same audience but its writing team isn’t even in the same league it’s amateurish
843,startrek,i hated him in the beginning but eventually came to love him just as much as any part of the crew
844,startrek,thanks good luck for your dissertation
845,startrek,yes sure once my dissertation is finished ill post the results in this thread
846,startrek,it does it quite a lot less efficiently it just does it faster
847,startrek,janeway did nothing wrong
848,startrek,yeah i agree discovery as a whole isn’t my favorite series of star trek but there are a few characters/episodes/plots that i think were done really well i think it would benefit from focusing more on characters other than michael though don’t get me wrong she’s a great character but there are other great characters who deserve more screen timei definitely think the 2nd and 3rd season are a bit more like regular star trek despite the obvious differences although tbh i didn’t like season 1 that much
849,startrek,it also didnt help that kes was only 9 years old so that added an extra layer of creepy
850,startrek,thank you
851,startrek,saul rubinek is a great actori dont actually hate the episode but its also not one of my favorites anymore it used to be its just a little too long for my liking im a bit lets say satisfied with episodes of good folks held hostage by bad folks trying to find their way out of their hopeless situation while not attracting attention of the bad folks gorillas thats why i also dont really like the latest two episodes of dis its too obvious too much good always prevails no matter the price and well whos gonna be killed off next as in the extremely annoying negan seasons of the walking dead in the tng episode where yar died it was very much unpredictable because killing main characters wasnt really a thing back then especially not as part of the main plot that got only acceptable for the broader audience with game of thrones and the walking dead and it kind of makes the shows arbitrary if it happens too often you avoid building a relationship with the main characters to avoid negative emotions when they are killed and especially in a situation like that of rick and his friends and family who got terrorized by negan multiple seasons it really gets annoying after a while good thing they didnt do that with the most toys but what i feel about it has changed drastically since i saw it first particularly because of the hostage-taking plot which had been reused a hundred times in so many different shows not only star trek its boring and annoying i hope theyll end it soon in dis and will never play this plot again its the second time now if i remember correctly first time was harry mudd i dont need a third hostage situation in dis
852,startrek,tng &gt; ds9 &gt; voy &gt; ent &gt; tos &gt; dsc &gt; pic
853,startrek,what if you owe lonestar a million for an emergency extraction
854,startrek,yeah  they basically solved death  that’s canon
855,startrek,season 2 of tng is *great* they stopped ending episodes prematurely eg *the instant the action is over and gave the characters as least one scene to decompress and marinate in what just happened she they standardized the jargon to make the narrative technobabble easier to follow and even predicti dont even know how its possible to argue that season 3 wasnt even that good but argue that you even like tng at all unless you just like the movies *shudder*
856,startrek,this is where you’re wrong the success of star trek has always been the morality tales the sjw nonsense of today was already pioneered by trek 50 years ago to have it constantly rammed down our throats is a product of the sjw nonsense of today it’s not brave or bold it’s jarring and boring star trek lost the bigots in 1967 after kirk and uhura shared a kiss star trek is about good characters and people finding themselves whilst trying to make their universe better to see the doctor fellating the engineer whilst their he/she/theyno one cares wesley crusher wunderkints around in the background then they all look at the camera and say “are you ok with this you bigots you better be because it is totally normal” just to teach a lesson to people in the year 2020 is so totally redundant and painful no one cares skin colour sex orientation species or anything else just give us interesting characters and good people
857,startrek,now with multiplex pattern buffers
858,startrek,id like to point out this subreddit isnt an unbiased sample especially in the case of new trek youd get better results if you post it somewhere else too thought trolls may attack you
859,startrek,tom paris was my least favorite character and belanna was my favorite go figure they could have jettisoned tom out an airlock to improve the show
860,startrek,id say just do some digging about tng ds9 and voyand maybe the movies; then start with the one you like most once you finish tos watching order doesnt make that much of a difference
861,startrek,i feel like this has a double meaning
862,startrek,a tier: tng ds9b tier: voy tos but only with the original 60s effects shotsc tier: ent ld any of short treks that doesnt feature any characters who originated on disd tier: d is for discoe tier: tas short treks with the disco crewf tier: pic starting around episode 5
863,startrek,tng ds9 tos voyager enterprise tas ld discovery picard
864,startrek,i agree-she made the hard choices
865,startrek,i think we could all use a chief morale officer
866,startrek,1voyager and tng2 ds93 discovery4 picard5 enterprise
867,startrek,ds9lower decksdiscotngvoypicardenttos
868,startrek,i quite liked the gorn tbh it was so so utterly terrible and it looked like they were trying to cgi a guy in a shitty silicone halloween costume you can especially see it in the way the neck skin folds and moves which was the perfect look for such a heavy fanservice and campy episode
869,startrek,considering the content is made to generate fans and subscribers and customers he has the right to say what he wants out of the showas do i  and all the other responders herei know its hard for the rabid keyboard warriors to accept that there are plenty of good reasons why people dislike the show but its just the way it isall the criticisms mentioned in this thread are valid
870,startrek,i like picard-but killing icheb made it hard to like
871,startrek,if q had sent them home - admiral janeway would have never had the chance to take the borg down a notch underplaying the damage because we will have to see if the borg ever come back
872,startrek,yeah everybody should be aware of their bubble&gt;well i dont know what score you are referring to exactly but i feel like 48% the tomatometer
873,startrek,&gt; if it gives us more oded fehr then im happy with that choicecant argue with that vance has been great easily my favourite character this season
874,startrek,i think he might be the oldest/most experienced director they have and he can do what he likes because nobodys gonna tell him otherwise hes two-takes frakes
875,startrek,this complaint about her whispering is ridiculous at this point she isnt whispering shes speaking softly theres a difference
876,startrek,i cant think of a better one both sides made reasonable-sounding cases and both sides had an unspoken agenda that they werent able to push by simply lying a real battle of wits and nerves
877,startrek,i agree voyager starts off fairly strong which is very unlike a st show i think season 1&amp;2 have some great eps
878,startrek,but they can use warp its just that dilithium scarcity leaves people trying to avoid it if they can
879,startrek,the character arc for nog and his relationship with jake and rom was for me personally the best arc in ds9
880,startrek,that line is the grandfather of this line in disco
881,startrek,will you post the results i’m really curious
882,startrek,i despise the neelix character but youre quite right he was perfect for this and tuvoks goodbye to him when he left the ship was a beautiful moment
883,startrek,but thats the wrong call because a hostile faction currently has control of discovery the priority is not personal relationships its preventing emerald chain from controlling the spore drive which theyd use as a weapon against the galaxythe reason starfleet officers take the kobayashi maru test is to prepare them to make those kinds of calls stamets wasnt acting like a starfleet officer at that moment - he was emotionally compromised michael made the correct call to remove him from the situation for the wider good rather than letting her personal attachments get in the wayyou dont seem to understand how starfleet is supposed to work you want something that would have been monumentally stupid and would show that michael had learned absolutely nothing from her earlier experiences when she allowed her emotions to get in the way the problem here is you not michaels correct choice
884,startrek,ive seen him bantering about andorian makeup with the guy who plays ryn on twitter so he still seems to be engaged with the universe to some extent
885,startrek,1 voy2 tng3 tos*big gap*4 dis*even bigger gap*5 ent6 ds9 i know i know very unpopular opinion but i just dont like it at all sorry yall 7 pichavent seen tas and lower decks
886,startrek,i love discovery i said it
887,startrek,it’s the sjw nonsense held by the producers they made a future with 0 straight white men where a black woman is so super strong and awesome that she can do everything it’s the epitome mary sue and they sacrifice any notion of reality just to fit their narrative stupidly not realising it is not bold and brave to it in star trek none of us cared about sex skin colour or species since kirk first kissed uhura it’s just jarring their is an excellent show somewhere in disco they just gotta quit all the bs and make it more ensemble and traditional
888,startrek,i like it i dont buy it for a second but its a fun idea
889,startrek,in rom we trust
890,startrek,eh same issue how the hell would there os run on discovery or any federation ship unless the one thing the universe agrees on is processor architecture
891,startrek,you look like you are trying to restore a multi-system conglomeration 
892,startrek,its fascinating how the characters people seem to love most this season are the put-upon bureaucrats vance and sahil i feel like a vance spinoff would mostly consist of him sat at his desk sighing at the latest bullshit in his inbox
893,startrek,i got 3 episodes in and just kinda stopped  felt like an action movie with startrek props
894,startrek,&gt;i feel like theyre saving the federation president for a reveali think theyve already established one 32nd century federation authority figure and they dont want to introduce another new character to do the same stuff at the 11th hour if it gives us more oded fehr then im happy with that choice
895,startrek,it’s all the sjw nonsense everyone is perfectly capable of you give them a chance and ignore a billion years of evolution tilly an overweight spotty nerd with autism commanding a starship gimme a break a tv show with faster than light travel alien species that all look and sound like us the q who are god like omnipotents programmable matter all of it i watch and enjoy but when they put tilly as no 1 that’s when it becomes unbelievable
896,startrek,tuvix was dealt with the most federation way everchange my mind :
897,startrek,i wasnt sure what the appropriate fallacy for dumbing the other persons argument down past the point of recognition or usefulness would be
898,startrek,i just finished the first season and overall i really liked it most of the plot turns were rather predictable to me but the one that had my jaw drop was &gt;that lorca came from the parallel universe&lt; like those last two eps were some real good scifithat said there were some things that *really* bothered me i am all for breaking conventional story telling tropes but it feels like the writers knew how to write good action scifi but had no idea how to write good star trek couple of examples come to mind: i didnt feel any kinship with the space tardigrade and i thought the mycelial network was ridiculous the fact that there was zero meaningful blowback or consequences to harry mudd repeatedly murdering everyone annoyed me like the only thing that felt like trek was that it was set in the star trek universe a ton of the moralizing and philosophizing just seemed super tacked on as if in the process someone said: hey dont forget to throw this in there otherwise longtime fans will be upset and i think there is a way to make it star trek *and* good gritty scifi but to me although i enjoyed it it fell short of achieving that blend the first season did anyway
899,startrek,filled out good luck with your dissertation 🖖
900,startrek,star trek vi was exploration of a different kind i would say actually represents classic trek perfectly court martial episodes or day of the dove
901,startrek,&gt;some of what they do is top tier trek stuff but then some of it is among the worst shit ive ever i think that every trek series is like this theyre always a mixed bag of extremely well made episodes mixed with cringe some characters work better than others fans debate whether hated characters are actually that bad or not overall i enjoy discovery but also recognize its flaws something i can say for every series
902,startrek,yes lets just conveniently forget that china exists and is one of the worst totalitarian regimes in the history of the world
903,startrek,it was a choice of ethics it was stay or allow a race to perish that sounds more like what the equinox crew would have done and look what happened to them
904,startrek,stop trying to smoke funny things and force your fantasies on othersi respect him of his honesty and respect him
905,startrek,thing is a lot of garbage states which are worse than the usa are backed by the usa such as israel or saudi arabia if we are talking about major powers russia is the only contender for as bad as the us though
906,startrek,something to keep in mind is that each captain is a product of their era and situation most starfleet means something different in the tos era than the tng era and we never saw picard try to deal with the situations sisko janeway or archer did i think starfleet has a more diverse school of thought that we assume ie ever ass hat admiral who got promoted despite having very different ideas to what we think is starfleet
907,startrek,i thought they missed something big with ariam most star trek series had characters trying to discover their humanity we had spock data odo seven of nine t’pol  mostly how they could become more emotionally aware and integrate with the world around them something many star trek fans probably related too but we never had a character like her a human woman so devastatingly injured she is almost essentially an alien to her self and her own race imagine what that would have done for people with disabilities or disfigurements showing them a character overcoming their issues seeing her fall in love seeing her confront her injuries under the mask of their mechanical parts seeing her to see where she can still make a difference in the world would have been awesome in this show we got bland reinterpretations of it with tilly being a mild autistic or whatever she is or michael being stained with vulcanism just a bit meh
908,startrek,its obviously clippy/badgey
909,startrek,janeway do hit different doe ;
910,startrek,it took a while but neelix has grown on me and is far more likeable with tonsore personality than the majority of the bridge crew from discovery most of whom i cant even remember their names
911,startrek,amazing thank you for the in depth response
912,startrek,i totally agreeand i try to make sure to represent that not all the fá dóm is negative towards discovery but it makes sense that those who are disgruntled will be more motivated to talk about it than those who arent
913,startrek,1 voyager2 ds9&amp;#x200b;3 enterprise4 tng&amp;#x200b;5 disco6 tos&amp;#x200b;7 pic
914,startrek,i didnt know that and am so annoyed they are doing that i just am not a fan of the character at all
915,startrek,for real hahaha i had no idea
916,startrek,i don’t think that’s fully true owo and airiam have a had quite a bit revealed about them; and we’re slowing learning about detmer
917,startrek,are you gonna elaborate on that then
918,startrek,except the finale
919,startrek,i dont think the ufp president is meant to be a big plot twist i just think they didnt want to introduce an important new character this late in the series when we already have vance as an authority figurethat said i think its hologram moriarty
920,startrek,no fucking way lol
921,startrek,the story idea itself wasnt terrible it was just the execution  it didnt help that all the characters acted like robots not just data picard was extremely off-putting as well he doesnt look riker in the eye when they first meet
922,startrek,people only say something is too woke or too political when its politics they dont agree with funny thatstar trek has being saying war is bad and racism is bad for over fifty years now youd have hoped those watching wouldve got the message by now
923,startrek,if you play other mmos sto will be disappointing its storys pretty good but its gameplay *really* isnt i tried really hard to like it and i just cant on the plus side it has very frequent appearances from the actual trek actors and parts of the early game were narrated by leonard nimoy before he diedi assume by everything canon youre including the animated series which is technically canon atm but not often accepted as such and short treks which can be easy to miss if you dont know they exist already if not there you goi understand there are some truly die-hard fans of the ds9 relaunch novels but i dont know where to start you off on those the one that i know in particular is that andrew robinson garaks actor wrote a stitch in time which is essentially garaks autobiography i havent read it but ive seen many on this sub praise it as to fanfic i really only go in for hyper-specific crossovers so im not much help unless you want to read my currently stalled picard/steins;gate crossoveri can tell you of the existence of memory beta though just as memory alpha is the comprehensive wiki for canon trek memory beta is the somewhat less comprehensive wiki for non-canon trek consider picking a character you find interesting and zipping down to their pages citations without reading the actual page to get a partial list of works theyve appeared in
924,startrek,also burnham was responsible for the burn as a surprise twist
925,startrek,no didnt you see the field bubble around him and the tractor beam that locked onto him
926,startrek,i think thats why the writers got rid of her too easy
927,startrek,not really how many times do you see people commenting or saying the only reason they arent watching is because the massive amount of bad reviews we seem to get a post every other week on this sub saying something along the lines of why did i listen to the reviews i actually love discoveryi mean most of the criticism lobbed at it have almost become copypasta
928,startrek,tng&gt;ds9&gt;tos&gt;ld&gt;ent&gt;voy&gt;dis&gt;pichavent seen tasout of interest how many people actually have an urge to ever rewatch episodes from picard or discovery its like im up to date with the broad beats of the story and theres nothing to be gained from going back and watching again which is a shame considering how many times ive rewatched the others
929,startrek,season 3 had the price the vengeance factor &amp; menage a troi so it wasnt all good but yes it was generally a dramatic step up in quality from seasons 1-2 and had many great episodes
930,startrek,i completely agree with you and i dont have anything to add to your comment probably i havent been very clear i didnt want to say that she didnt have any character development; of course she had what i meant is that these klingon outburst plots seem for me very repetitive and insufficient for a very nice character; and that she was explored as an interesting character mainly at the end of the show  id like to see more of her some flashbacks in starfleet in the maquis; how and what made belanna belannaa lot of unexplored potential; thats what i meant by underutilized
931,startrek,what do you mean that title is perfect for himhe leaves the ship to go scam and smuggle needed supplies and as soon as he is off board morale goes up
932,startrek,it was basically a back door pilot for her section 31 show
933,startrek,i think the mirror universe is really just ridiculous at least how it’s portrayed considering how limited the budget seems to be at times they should have saved the money on the club sets and gold outfits and just done a normal episode
934,startrek,he was also thier database of delta customs before nine showed up and was thier ambassador to some of the shadier back alleys he singlehandedly kicked off the alliance of the void by convincing red leather crew to join the efforst to escape the void instead of just trying to kill eachother to survive
935,startrek,she has been arrested a few times lol
936,startrek,osyraas nose bugged me to the point that i found myself thinking about it and not paying attention on the episode i thought something was wrong with it and thought it was because of prosthetics or something then i searched for jannet kidder osyraas actress in other productions and well its her nose thats kind like that really it seems it doesnt move normally like other humans noses or maybe my perception of her nose is just biased now xdanyway i like texture theyve put into the skin it makes much more interesting than simple paint i find it funny so many people think the plain body paint of the old look - that killed human skin texture and the subtle nuances human skin have- is better than this
937,startrek,as much as i can appreciate some aspects of discovery i just can’t bring myself to enjoy a show where the dialogue and story arc are so nonsensical on every level that i’ve stopped caringsure it’s an okay generic sci-fi show on its own merits if you just want to shut off your brain and not think too hard and binge through a season but it’s just intellectually too vapid to be trek all the artifacts of trek are more so just background for what is otherwise a typical 90’s mexican soap opera but in spacenearly 80% of the show is padded by characters rattling off repetitive over-the-top emotional speeches with characters “meaningfully staring” into each other’s eyes for no reason as one of them is “in distress” and the other is giving them a pep talk either it’s michael and phillipa or michael and saru or michael and the trill non-binary girl or trill non-binary girl and her ghost non-binary boyfriend or michael and tilly or tilly and stamets or stamets and hugh or hugh and detmer etc etc it’s the exact same scene the exact same dynamic replayed with different characters over *and over* ***and over again***it’s like being at a lesbian wedding where the brides keep saying their vows and everyone is drunkenly pms-ing in the bathroom having an emotional breakdown — for 3 bloody seasons straight pun not intended but all this hyped up emotion gets spent on some contrived dilemma that gets built up yet forgotten two seconds later because now there’s an *even more* pressing contrived dilemmait might be meaningful here and there in the right moment but after 300 times in every flipping episode it’s utterly mind-numbing
938,startrek,took his six and a half years of plotting and biding his time and he had to fight kim for a klingon mate but he finally destroyed everything tuvok owned with his monstrous genitalia classic telaxian power move
939,startrek,thats always been one of my biggest complaints about voyager all the characters the plot and many of the sub plots that came along were amazing ideas but many of them were severely underdeveloped and just seemed to be like oh and this super interesting thing about this character and they never went further than a quick tease as a kid it didnt matter or i didnt notice but now it bugs me all to hell still love voyager though
940,startrek,how can you not mention “the offspring”
941,startrek,he just doesnt notice as much there because those were progressive messages from the 80s and 90s now its 2010s progressive and they committed serious crimes like a person with they/them pronouns or whatever woke thing it was pic did i really dont know /s obv
942,startrek,season 3 of tng is great i think op gets that is the general consensus we dont need everyone to hammer home about it and i dont think this was intended to be a season 3 appreciation thread though i have no objection to such a thing
943,startrek,its literally someone giving valid critism and suggestions to improve the show what on earth are you talking about just because you dont share someones opinion it doesnt mean you need to attack it
944,startrek,how about deep space 9s *blood oath* jadzia is central to the episode but shes not the driving force behind it shes there to give us a familiar face through which to experience the episode while kang kor and koloth drive the plot
945,startrek,tng the next generation is the usual recommended startpoint because it was a return to the franchise after the original series had been off the air for some time and therefore doesnt really assume you have any previous knowledge be warned the first season or two aredivisive because it was still finding its feet and still living in the shadow of its predecessorif you want individual episodes to show you what the franchise has to offer before you jump in and commit to a show tngs cause and effect is a commonly recommended sample episode personally i would also suggest tngs tapestry and deep space nines the visitor but i dont see people recommend those as starters much so i may not be accounting for something
946,startrek,mmmaybe i never felt that but its been a while since i read it sounds like a good excuse to read it again :-
947,startrek,1 tng2 voyager3 ds94 tos5 lower decks6 enterprisei havent seen the others and i havent finished enterprise yet so that might change that said i love all the series ive seen so far
948,startrek,at the very least chakotay deserved a different kind of spotlight replace the fake indian background with one portraying him as a member of an actual native american tribe no sky spirits or any of that garbage develop him more and develop him properly and actually succeed in what they intended: making an uhura for native americansthen again that would have involved kicking the hack expert off the consultant list
949,startrek,oh yea big funny lines are the same as everyday actions
950,startrek,i love projections it is my headcanon that that is essentially the episode in which the doctor gains sentience
951,startrek,funny how yours says edited and mine doesn’t
952,startrek,you probably dont like having half the show about the mirror universe either 🤣
953,startrek,tng/ds9enttosthe rest
954,startrek,the great thing for me about where the franchise is right now is that they are really branching out pushing the limits of what kinds of stories can be told in a star trek show and what a star trek show can be you may not get everything you want from discovery but you may from lower decks strange new worlds etci always keep in mind that the first potential star trek spin-off would have been assignment earth something that would bear little to know resemblance to any star trek show weve had yet
955,startrek,shes good in revulsion as well
956,startrek,every major event yes usually every single thing that happens not really even though i dont agree with the former either the dominion war was won at least in part by garak he got the romulans to enter where sisko would have failed and odo who cured the other changelings etc everyone had their part sisko was the centre but he didnt do it alone
957,startrek,walking dead style
958,startrek,i feel like lower decks is like mildly funny without trek knowledge but its downright hilarious when youve seen the whole franchise or even just the 80s-90s shows you can only watch something for the first time once so make the best of it
959,startrek,murder is murder though in federation law the way there was a tender moment between picard and seven that meant something only for her to immediately ignore it and then go on a killing spree was the furthest away from star trek morality i think i’ve ever seen and with it being so central characters all the more abhorrent what should have happened is seven actually goes back captures whoever nothing evil character was and take her into custody because no one deserves to die ever
960,startrek,yeah this is my problem it doesnt feel like shes doing anything great because we already know before she even started that its going to be about her
961,startrek,&gt;i do wish neelix wouldve been more overprotective father figure than romance with kes but we got what we gotthe problem there was it was kind of a merging of both concepts which is what made it a little creepy i liked neelix better when i didnt see him interacting with kes and once she was off the ship
962,startrek,good for youwould you have also tortured a fellow starfleet officer for betraying you would you have locked him out of the controls and threatened to lower his shields to allow an alien to kill him if your first officer tried to save the life of the man you were torturing would you have threatened him too finally would you endanger your ship and crew for the sake of this personal vendettaequinox is a damn good episode but it also confirms that janeway is not a good person similar to archers crippling character flaws i dont know how anyone could argue this
963,startrek,yes but why do they have to revolve around a specific person anyway why not a q or something just happened because science or another alien extinct culture the problem isnt that shes the one who saves everyone its that shes the one whos star-trek-magically destined to be the one who saves everyone at some point its so predictable that it becomes boring and to counter your examples in the ensigns of command data is the one who manages to evacuate the colonists in in the pale moonlight and inter arma enim silent leges garak and bashir respectively are solving the problems even though the former is sisko telling the story personally in one the crew excecpt for the doctor and seven are literally in stasis etc the captains or main characters were usually the ones in focus of the big stories usually because as the captains they make the decisions but they were never the ones who did everything
964,startrek,and the show writers=the book writers just shows even more how much having a plan and a direction is basic level writing which disco is lacking when you compare the two the expanse does everything disco does better with the same time less money less advertising and a constant threat of being canned
965,startrek,not from the show but there is some background material and ugh tweets from the writers of pic
966,startrek,extreme risk is pretty raw in portraying that as belanna episodes go i also really like muse and prototype where shes left to her devices
967,startrek,the third season of tng began with an immediate and dramatic increase in quality  in fact you could turn on any episode from season three even the premiere episode and it would be recognizable as good tng in fact the only way you would be able to tell that it was early s3 would be those wool uniforms that had the vertical creases running up and down the sides of the chest  those lasted for five or six eps and then the creases disappeared and they became the uniforms we see for the rest of the showso yeah  season three is not only when tng started to become good but its actually good  all of it
968,startrek,you forgot instant travel: personal teleported and mushroom speed eliminate plot development everything is instant
969,startrek,for being canceled so soon ent seems to be doing pretty well me thinks it shouldnt have been cancelled
970,startrek,this is your third ferengi are orions post in two daysdo not continue trying to spam the sub
971,startrek,ds9&gt;tng&gt;tos&gt;voy&gt;ld&gt;ent&gt;pic&gt;dsc&gt;tasgenuinely enjoy them all though the point between ent and ld is where it changes from like to love
972,startrek,yeah i dont hate burnham either but thats the other flaw with that approach: if you *hate* picard you probably wont enjoy tng thats just a fact but if you just dont like him you find him boring or pretentious guess what- theres a ton of episodes where hes on the sideline and the focus is on other charactersbut if you dislike burnham shes always there most of what other characters do in most not all episodes are about burnham burnham is a catalyst for the entire show so if she gets on your nerves even if its not that extreme thats a huge aspect of the show that doesnt click for you
973,startrek,1 tng2 dsc3 voy4 pic5 tos6 ds97 enti too think voyager is underrated conversely ds9 gets too much credit despite having some really great characters
974,startrek,also explains why the transporter buffers are somehow special not regular computer ram but some sort of magic material that can store an entire objects quantum state but there was that episode of ds9 where they stored some of the crew using all the computers in the ship this wouldnt really make sense unless all computers in star trek are actually quantum computers although the space-magic neednt be consistent across episodes or even scenes just needs to be there to drive the plot
975,startrek,no you said we need to accept it like i said and we dont
976,startrek,rom’s reforms might have led to a “woke” “pc” ferengi or they might have led to a more ruthless society perhaps ferengi women are even more cutthroat than male ferengi in this case the ferengi would not have joined the federation
977,startrek,still second to kirk possibly third to pike time will tell
978,startrek,ds9tngvoytos moviesenttng moviesjj moviespictos only seen 15 seasonsdisi dont see lower decks as comparable to any of the above its a fun well written show but not serious sci-fi
979,startrek,&gt; tell me that the writers would never do something like that&gt; &gt; lol no really tell me they would never do thatthe writers would never do something like thatyes really im telling you they would never do thatand no tillys friend is not something like that
980,startrek,yes and its time for all the discovery apologists to come to terms with the fact that the show is terrible
981,startrek,1 tng2 ds93 tos4 ent5 voy6 lower decks7 disco8 tas9 pic
982,startrek,neelix is the perfect foil to tuvok
983,startrek,disagree with your assessment of janeway i’d have killed tuvix too
984,startrek,yep there are whole episodes of ds9 where sisko doesnt even show up or doesnt do much same with picard and janeway ent was too archer already for me personally but it still had focus on others dis is the only one where burnham is in a central role in every episode except maybe terra firma but technically even there pic obv too but that was the point of the show i dont particularly dislike michael burnham i just dont like the direction they went with their main character and i feel like if they were less focused on her shes get a lot less hate
985,startrek,this comment alone has made me happy that i didn’t watch past season 1
986,startrek,data shot first
987,startrek,1 deep space nine2 the next generation3 discovery4 voyager5 picard6 enterprise
988,startrek,i should probably give picard another more unbiased watch while i agree that its also pretty lame in contrast to std i never got to the point where i just skim through the episode each week to be spared the dialoguetbh this might just be my pre-existing fandom for the character picard thoughim gonna sceptically wait and see what season 2 brings
989,startrek,calm down  all us presidents suck
990,startrek,i hope biden is watching  also too bad obama didnt hear that when he started his presidency
991,startrek,well after nagus rom’s reforms they probably changed on a course to make them much more open minded in fact curiously the orions are more like their past counterparts than anyone else the orions could still be blood thirsty traders in tosbut i say that’s a little early to call that we won’t see one because now since they probably joined the federation president is now in fact a ferengi - probablythe uss nog has been carrying them on a tour to ferenginar
992,startrek,she was badass so was lorca but they were also both terrible people
993,startrek,more realistically i could see stacey abrams zooming in as the ufp president
994,startrek,test
995,startrek,and he makes himself useful
996,startrek,i dont see anything inherently negative about modifying the person of course theres going to be nuance depending on exactly what modifying entails melora for example really struggled with the fact that the procedure might make her lose part of her identity and make it difficult for her to visit her home planet meanwhile im struggling to recall episodes but i dont think geordi ever had an existential problem with his visor if anything i think he was probably grateful to have itthe problem with modifying the environment is that you cant modify the whole world or in star treks case the universe if i recall correctly part of meloras problem was that the ds9 being a cardassian space station was simply not easy to retrofit for her needs not only that but she didnt want to be limited to working in a low-g environment she *wanted* to go work outside of low g environments and that was much of the focus of the episode imagine all the places that geordi would not have been able to go or all the things that he would not have been able to accomplish if he was limited to environments that were modified to suit his needs
997,startrek,melora came from a race that evolved on a low gravity world which was why she was so weak in normal gravity it’s been a while since i rewatched that episode but i’m fairly certain i remember melora’s quarters were adjusted for her so she could have her natural low gravity environment they just couldn’t do that to the entire station because everybody else on board would struggle with that from essential crewman to the large civilian populationthey could have tried other adjustments though instead of just plonking her in a chair in real life we can make artificial arms that react to pressure and the electrical impulses in nerves endings to open/close/rotate the hand as the wearer wants no reason why in star trek they couldn’t make some kind of exoskeletal suit type thing that did the same allowing her to just walk around her movements would be a little slow/jerky but otherwise nothing to stop her doing what anyone else does in normal gravityi’m pretty sure there was a tos episode with a woman who turned out to be completely blind but wore a sensory net that allowed her to know the proximity to things and therefore move about normally i always assumed with geordi there was a range of options and he picked the visor cause it’s what he liked best it’s certainly a help with his job on a fair few occasions
998,startrek,janeway is a badass captain maybe even the best of the franchise
999,startrek,she celebrates her 2nd birthday in the first or second season
1000,startrek,&gt; also the fenris rangers are quasi-anarchists they dont commission officersdo we actually know anything about the fenris rangers
1001,startrek,ok bro
1002,startrek,you asked why you were downvoted and i gave you my perspective on it now you want to argue with me why others are wrong to downvote you thats what i get for trying to helpand your follow-up argument is not convincing to me either for what its worth but since you are far more interested apparently in being right than in actually having an insightful discussion im not even going to go there
1003,startrek,well weve been treated to a different captain each season so far so maybe theyre going to continue with that tradition
1004,startrek,ds9voyager tng ent toslower decks discovery picard tas
1005,startrek,all hail grand nagus rom
1006,startrek,1 deep space nine2 the next generation3 enterprise4 voyager5 the original series6 discovery7 picard8 the animated seriesi havent seen lower decks yet sorry im european
1007,startrek,rom and nog are my two favorite trek characters father/son goals for sure
1008,startrek,can you expand on this i was curious and looked her up on memory alpha but couldnt find anything about being forgotten
1009,startrek,rom is based
1010,startrek,i think this is better for a show like ds9 it feels more natural almost like they are actually reacting to what happens in the various stories when an arc is planned out things often become predictable
1011,startrek,lets not forget he got to marry leeta as well
1012,startrek,as evidenced with bashir’s genetic engineering
1013,startrek,they have no fuses in the consoles still no way will they add a medkit
1014,startrek,i never said you have to like it; that’s your call but you do have to accept that tv is done differently now compared to 25 years ago; that is a fact
1015,startrek,i think its been a while since you watched the show maybe torres starts out as a hothead she grows into becoming more than good with a wrench and turns into a competent engineer and they dont just tell us when she likes someone we see her and paris slowly come together over the whole runwe see her address her klingon emotions in a bunch of episodes as she slowly comes to term with them and we learn her temper is why she joined the maquis the two episodes you mention are good you left out faces though we see her deal with seskas betrayal and we see her battle depression after the maquis are destroyed
1016,startrek,i wouldnt try to use that analogy if you were talking with actual disabled people if i were you
1017,startrek,thats my fear either someone in the nebula or on the ship or both will die and michael and stamets relationship will be broken&amp;#x200b;i noticed that there is a red shirt with the command crew they brunette lady dont recognise her
1018,startrek,so its ok to pile a bunch of shit on top of theseis a bit of effort really that much to askdic has a ton of potential its just depressing to watch what it ends up as
1019,startrek,officially the unofficial tag line of the franchise
1020,startrek,the most recent episode of discovery has a scientist who is paralyzed the actor has als i think it was handled wonderfullystar trek like the rest of society has evolved on how it handles these matters it was still behind modern views on topics in the cases where it was ahead of its time but its gotten better as more shows have been produced that you cite examples from 20-30 years ago rather than the current iterations of trek prove my point the way trek handled disability 20-30 years was groundbreaking but it wouldnt fly today similarly the way trek handled transgender people in ds9 was groundbreaking then but is woefully inadequate today trek improved on that with discovery
1021,startrek,i agree with everything here and i love star trek too most telling for me was when they finally had an episode centered on the cybernetic woman airiam i had to google her name how many viewers even realized she was played by different actresses again i only know because of googlejust imagine how hard her death episode would have hit if wed known her like tasha yar or jadzia dax it should have been a somber farewell but instead we are given all of her character development in her final episode it hurt but not for the right reason ‐ viewers were left wishing shed had more development instead of properly mourning her sacrifice its funny how orville is a direct contrast a trek‐like show that allows for more humor and yet if any one of the characters died fans would be *devastated* can even the most ardent star trek fans say the same for every one of discoverys main characters **thats** the freaking problem with star trek: discovery
1022,startrek,yeah people really tend to underestimate how good an engineer barclay is in addition to the fact that many of his awkward moments hes actually right and just doesnt express it well itshouldnt do that is just barclay for theres absolutely no reason it should be doing that and every diagnostic scan ive tried has turned up nothing it should be functioning perfectly once geordi gets him out of his shell and gets to know him he becomes his right hand man in less than two years to the point that geordi seems to consider him indispensable
1023,startrek,first of all there were officers on the main stations who were unnamed extras - after wesley left and geordie went to engineering there was always at least one person on the conn/navigation who we didnt know and often we didnt know both of them also what youre saying here is a bad faith argument in itself - some of the bridge crew members on dis like owo and to an extent detmer are essentially extras just with names and a few lines dis has as many main characters as post-wesley tng or at least they did until georgiou left theyre just more spread out across the ship instead of all being bridge crew
1024,startrek,agreed id live without those cap proton episodes; i think that chakotay deserves a bit more though
1025,startrek,also she never finished the commanding training program but looks like it’s unnecessary if i you go through a wormhole
1026,startrek,all shows and movies tend to be a very focused study of an individual it kind of happened with house instead of building up all charactors they build up and tear down oneit just how tv and movies are now
1027,startrek,with his luck hes probably lost half his limbsi imagine he was a big deal before mars considering how crucial he was to pathfinder and his research in holograms but i suspect the synth ban would have seriously reversed those fortunes although that may be somewhat affected by the actual status of holograms under the ban which is so far extremely unclear not only would one of his areas of expertise have suddenly become suspicious dangerous research barclay would be one of the first people to speak out against the ban and his history of holo-addiction would probably have been brought up as a way to discredit him and paint him as a synth sympathizer while i dont think this would entirely destroy his career it would take him down several notches and hurt his credibility and considering his fairly fragile mental state the sudden public pressure might cause a breakdown
1028,startrek,its *still* the discovery  the whole joke in ld is that the pakleds are too stupid to tell the difference - even when they arent the same class of ship  even *if* another copy of disco shoed up it would make sense to say the line  is it a reference to disco every time they go to warp  or fire phasers
1029,startrek,because its a thorn in their eye
1030,startrek,i mean i think her actions were totally justified but murdering someone for venegance is still murderironically something voy went to great lenghts to point out more than a few times
1031,startrek,i honestly wouldnt be surprised also would explain why other ferengi treat him as stupid and worthless a conformist capitalist society like theirs wouldnt exactly be kind to people of different neurotypes
1032,startrek,the federation isnt really weak due to a lack of dilithium so much as it is weak because its stretching itself and too busy putting out fireswe do see some indications that they are at least technologically equal if not a bit superior for instance the chain uses subspace communications technology ahead of the federation using principles unknown to the federation or at least adira and discoverys crew
1033,startrek,tuvix was permabanned
1034,startrek,everyone wants to feel special and with discovery the message is that you are special but with the effect that everyone else is less than you its almost like the televisual equivalent of social media algorithms that put people in echo chambers
1035,startrek,this is all i wanted to say and more thanks in my opinion is the price they had to pay when they hired a star actor for michael role i’m sure we’ll never get rid of her central role ruining all the plot also i’d love if they did more than 20 episodes in a lower budget exploring the characters even in trivial days instead of a triple a show every episode focusing always only on the main plot thread
1036,startrek,i mean having torpedoes and warp tech means i dont really remember what the main issue was in blowing it up lmao
1037,startrek,where
1038,startrek,i wont tell you the details on archer in case you want to see enterprise later as for janeway she murders tuvix destroys the caretakers ship thereby dooming the ocampa and the voyager crew mercilessly tortures and tries to murder a starfleet officer in equinox fucks around with the mind of a sentient being the doctor aids the borg in destroying an alien species that was just defending itself and literally commits genocide murders trillions of borg drones
1039,startrek,&gt;shes a commissioned officer of the fenris rangerswhich is a vigilante organisation
1040,startrek,ni’var uses sb10 to gather earth defense force perhaps others and come to the rescue they do this because the president of ni’var wants to bang saru
1041,startrek,comromery
1042,startrek,we dont need to accept that its okay to not like something
1043,startrek,&gt; it would also help to learn sentence structure first then words *the klingon dictionary* by marc okrand matches this description; although its called a dictionary its essentially a reference grammar with a glossary at the end
1044,startrek,mr vulcan i want to see a smile on your face
1045,startrek,she had the option of gettin back to the alpha quadrant and didnt take itarriving in the alpha quadrant was an accident *staying* there was her choice
1046,startrek,well find out soon enough in the mean time im gonna ride this theory to the ground
1047,startrek,one of the henchmen had a helmet on that looked like the kelvin klingon helmets
1048,startrek,thats largely what got me thinking about it it  will likely end up just being visual flavor but all the holos we have met as holos have come off a little weird
1049,startrek,what the whole point of that episode was to show us her obeying the omega directive &amp; even contemplating completing the mission herself as a sacrifice to save her crew and carry out her orders only once she realised there was no chance of success from a solo mission did she involve seven in the crew effort after spiritual consultation from chakotay seven makes an appeal to janeways humanity asking to be allowed to fuck around with omega but janeway says the safety of the quadrant is at stake &amp; shes sorry but the orders from starfleet to destroy omega were paramount janeway &amp; her crew then destroy omega which just happens to stabilise on its own by chance at the last moment before being eliminated
1050,startrek,he says having edited his posts as well
1051,startrek,i’m just responding to get a notification when tacoman says somethingi’d also like to know how janeway is supposed to be that evili like voyager too but i agree with chakotay being weird and boring but the show made up for that with 7/9 and the doctor being so interesting
1052,startrek,i don’t think saru has progressed enough as a leader to be an admiral yet honestly
1053,startrek,discovery - worst
1054,startrek,i was almost offended on how much the drinker and i concur 100% when it comes to star trek this guys thoughts are so on point and reasonable if you look past his drunk shtick which annoys some people
1055,startrek,it’s a shitty door
1056,startrek,and people say burnham is a know it all character at least she is one of the specialists and sticks to her field of expertise mostly
1057,startrek,nothing good lol
1058,startrek,kes would only live till 9 i think she was 2-3 in the early seasons
1059,startrek,i started off watching season 3 of disco i accept the fact the first couple of seasons of every star trek is not the best other than lower decks lower decks is good right off the back
1060,startrek,not really you have to realize that although osyrra was being honest she wasnt negotiating from a position of superiority not really  the emerald chain is desperate and they only want to unite with the federation to ensure their continued survival the fact that they only wanted out outlaw freaking slavery as a compromise to the federation as opposed to their own moral inhibitions shows what kind of a society they are an alliance built out of necessity between two civilizations that are completely morally incompatible would never last past dealing with the immediate crisis
1061,startrek,im glad you like it but it actually sucks there you go you just read half the comments under this post
1062,startrek,ive noticed this whole getting unhealthily attached/fixated on single things a lot more over the past 10 ish years
1063,startrek,nah picard managed to actually do the limbo right under the low bar that disco set
1064,startrek,discovery’s ship designs is what the kelvin timeline should have looked like the classic trek designs but heavily modernised
1065,startrek,best: anything without time travelworst: anything with time travel
1066,startrek,sight loss is very different for every individual but there’s definitely a difference in attitude between people born blind versus those who lose their sight after having vision modifying the environment is always a useful thing to do and can often have benefits for everyone eg tactile areas on pavements to indicate places to cross roads better signage in clear text most blind people have some degree of useful sight and people being aware / considerate is most important however i’d wager that a lot of people particularly if they lost their sight and have any memory of it would want what geordi has worked over 10 years in the sight-loss sector including leading on research into the views and wishes of people
1067,startrek,i’m just glad the cause of the burn wasn’t burnham or the discovery
1068,startrek,season 3 should be deleted
1069,startrek,episode 5 - the bondingworf adopts an orphan who promptly stops existing next episodeepisode 6 - the booby traplaforge isnt gay hes just awkward and creepy and lots of other old stereotypes about gay peopleepisode 7 - the enemyalmost the same plot as masterpiece society which was the better version of the twoepisode 9 - the vengeance factori honestly dont even remember this one that well in spite of seeing it multiple times which i think says a lot i do remember it being fairly cringey and feeling slow and like old timey tvepisode 14 - a matter of perspectivea remake of the 1950s japanese movie rashomon rashomon was sexist and rape apologia even for its time tng decides to one up rashomon by changing it so that its about a woman making up a rape accusation in order to bring down a good manepisode 18 - allegiance i almost filed this away under mediocre not bad it has some of the hammiest acting not just in star trek but in tng specifically not the hammiest but its up there i feel bad for mentioning it because if we include bad acting as a reason to dump on an episode then there isnt much trek left but seeing as everyone is dumping on discoverys acting i feel like its important to remind people really quickly about some of the acting in previous seriesepisode 21 - hollow pursuitsthere is some good stuff in here its nice to see a member of star trek that is neurodivergent and not perfect honestly all of the characters should have more issues and mental health problems or they should have to take large amounts of time off periodically in order to receive therapy and or meditate or whateverall of that aside what barclay was doing in the holodeck has to be some kind of sexual harassment / assault i get it was supposed to be funny barclay makes riker short riker doesnt like it and wants to shut it down troi stops him they come across a fuck doll version of troi and crusher then riker who is their boss tries to laugh it off throwing trois words about not being sensitive back at her was barclays representation of riker and other male crew members disrespectful and inappropriate absolutely is that the same as what he did to troi no way in hellepisode 24 - ménage à troithe ferengi are established to be raping abducting sex-slavers this is referenced throughout various series including ds9 where ferengis are routinely apologized for because they are supposed to be endearing or somethingepisode 25 - transfigurationssome alien needs help he has magic powers hes evolving into a being of pure energy and his government is trying to stop because theyre scared of change also worf dies and is resurrected almost immediatelyquintessential star trek right there also absolutely terrible
1070,startrek,if you break a shock absorber in your car do you repair the car or smooth the road
1071,startrek,i think what they meant was that the us is the least bad of all the major world powers which is debatable but not that crazy
1072,startrek,i dont blame her fuck nog
1073,startrek,cause every discovery related thing has people like that i honestly wonder why people who claim to hate it seem to be the ones seeking out all related content just to tell people they hate it
1074,startrek,yep
1075,startrek,give us thick rhys or give us death
1076,startrek,some of them looked very new perhaps they are heavier duty than the wrist projection ones not the 23 century models though
1077,startrek,i like when they tried to make him something more than a cook then were just like no youre a cook lol
1078,startrek,so in an episode that still has to resolve the ec take over of the ship osyrras missive to the federation sarus mission on the planet get stamets back to disco theres suddenly going to be a copy of an older but also a version that eventually gets abandoned version of the ship with no set-up for how it shows up  other than a single 10-minute segment that would raise more questions that it would answer
1079,startrek,i like disco and i think season 3 has been the best one yet buy its still a deeply flawed show and a large part of that is burnham hopefully that will change
1080,startrek,no no its nottheyll continue to cry until the show finaly ends with them drowning in said tears
1081,startrek,you were downvoted because you argued in bad faith there have been unnamed extras on all bridge sets on all trek shows i think and thats entirely beside the point /u/not--the-one was referring to the officers on the main stations which are typically named and given screen time and a profile and ongoing character development over course of the show could have worded it better but you very well knew what they meant
1082,startrek,they all use stunt doubles
1083,startrek,i couldn’t tell if nilsson in the mirror universe was brunette or if it was a different actor not hannah cheeseman but it looked almost like sarah mitich had a wig on for the mirror arc now we haven’t seen our blonde friend since and i’m concerned
1084,startrek,welllllllits basicaly science fantasy now
1085,startrek,yes this exactly it made him seem like a jealous creeper for the first part of the show dating a one year old and not wanting her to have any male friends too much  i end up liking him later on though
1086,startrek,*michael grabs saru slamming his face against the viewscreen*mb : look harder saru use your damned alien eyes why must you make me demonstrate my obvious superioritysaru: *whimpers as the bridge crew all pretend to be occupied*
1087,startrek,dont you realize that spock is the only nostalgia sponge in the entire series
1088,startrek,did you not notice that discovery in calypso is not retrofitted whereas the ship weve been seeing for the past few episodes is
1089,startrek,im starting wondering if not developing the other crew members is a money thingif they become actual members of the cast instead of being glorified extras would they have to be paid more would sonequa need / be willing to take a pay cut for them
1090,startrek,couldn’t agree morethey could have cut a lot of chakotay and paris in favor of more b’elannathe instances where she gets the spotlight however are awesome
1091,startrek,did you forget that the ship in calypso \*is\* the discovery
1092,startrek,natural choice because the show never gets into most of the side characters until the episode where we never see them again or they need another character to manufacture drama
1093,startrek,lower decks was supposed to air after season 3 of discovery and many of the jokes on it are actually referencing season 3as we see in calypso discovery is not retrofitted this is currently a plot hole and a second discovery would solve that
1094,startrek,the original series tos is a good place to start as it establishes the characters and the universe sidenote that its from the 60s - some of the plots are a little out therethe next thing to look at would be the first 4 start trek movies same cast of characters more up to date setsthen id go the next generation tng first modern star trek from there its up to you deep space nine ds9 and voyagervoy are set at around the same time
1095,startrek,lower decks was supposed to air after season 3 of discovery and many of the jokes on it are actually referencing season 3
1096,startrek,&gt;  what the enterprise isnt in the lower decks finale the titan isdid you forget the pakleds referring to every federation ship as the enterprise
1097,startrek,could just say it’s another copy“soong just kept a backup of his consciousness and we just keep cranking them out”spock two would be good
1098,startrek,&gt;prediction for the finale: big dumb battle of course osyraa goes back to her ship and calls in for reinforcement things look dire but then burnhams mum comes in with the vulcan-romulan fleet and the downed kelpian ship is space-magicd back into action by the kid science guy dies while saving the discoverys crew the battle looks even up until the fleet sent to kaminar comes back rikers on the flagship for some reason tilly remembers that dilithium can be reconditioned vulcan-romulan alliance rejoins federationall of this plus a fleet of ships from earth trill and planet yum yum
1099,startrek,ok that makes a *little bit* more sense but still none at all because as you pointed out calypso shows us that it is in fact the discovery
1100,startrek,i always liked neelix
1101,startrek,&gt;eye waterworks all the timeoh my god its like the final scene of a full house episode but like every 3rd scene its like seventh heaven or what i imagine this is us is probably like every character on that show needs to chill the fuck out
1102,startrek,he might be they did say his partner is orion although it could just as easily be that they’re friends and he just happens to have an orion partner orions seem very prominent in the emerald chain
1103,startrek,- tng- ds9- tos- voyagerhavent watched any of the others
1104,startrek,&gt;she was an ensign correctstill isbut also acting captain
1105,startrek,*tuvix has entered the chat oh wait no he hasn’t*
1106,startrek,yo that is straight up upsetting
1107,startrek,i get it and it was a well played out scene though it does just make me question why michael didnt vulcan nerve pinch the henchman just to be clear though ive no issue at all with that scene in particular however the one before with the wheelchair dude where he talks about adira as if they were his child but as youve said in your very nice and thorough comment thanks youve had to fill in a lot of blanks yourself and imo thats kinda bad the line about my child/having a child just really threw me off this is a 16 year old that hes known for less than a few months and now he sees them as his child they only told him about their gender issues a few weeks ago and now he sees himself as their father i am not saying that they didnt put work in to establish their relationship they did but that line really really threw me off much like you said with georgio for the scenes to make much sense we have to imagine a lot has gone on behind the scenes for a while ive felt like the crew of disco are actively watching the tv show thats how everyone knew that georgio had changed they watched the episode in the mirror universe and saw her save saru
1108,startrek,armin shimmermans stated motivation to play quark was that he wanted to redeem the ferengi as a concept because he also played the first ferengi on tng and felt partly responsible for how poorly they were handled there
1109,startrek,tos would not fly today within like 3 minutes of the pike pilot pike talks about getting used to having a women on the bridge and the entire premise of the episode too
1110,startrek,even weyoun gives him credit as the diabolical genius who came up with the idea for the self-replicating minefield
1111,startrek,its funny that they keep saying ftl travel has been extremely hampered but ships still seem to show up all over the galaxyseriously how did green ladies ship get to dilithium planet so quickly
1112,startrek,1 ds9 - love it2 tng - love it3 voy - good comfort food4 ld - how is this so good5 tos - fun not aged well6 disco - inconsistent but getting better7 pic - inconsistent but has potential8 ent - inconsistent got cut off before it could reach full potential9 tas - a couple of good-to-great episodes but overall just fine10 st - a couple of good-to-great episodes but overall just not that good
1113,startrek,you mean more unsafe than exloding consoles
1114,startrek,🙄 i disagree with seven becoming a murderer it was vengeance/justice for two people she loved that were brutally murdered seven was initially meant to be bisexual but it was the 90s and it was still pretty taboo for anyone to not be straight on tv much less bisexual thats still weirdly taboo in some ways also that very same crew seemed to all but abandon her after they got to earth
1115,startrek,i think hes referring to the fact that the pakleds referred to every federation ship as an enterprise including the titan not sure how that squares with an actual other discovery showing or how the calypso disco would be there at the same time
1116,startrek,oh yeah that got my blood boiling and not in a good ‘how a show makes you feel about the characters’
1117,startrek,&gt; odo: ive had my eye on you for a long time rom youre not as stupid as you look  &gt;  &gt;rom: i am too
1118,startrek,why should janeway or archer be imprisoned i haven’t seen enterprise and it’s been a bit on voyager
1119,startrek,well thatd throw this theory out of the window i tried to find if i could see anything mentioning him leaving and found nothing
1120,startrek,&gt;i dont know if the writers knew where they would ultimately take them or notthey pretty consistently state in interviews that they did not have a long-term plan for the show or most characters - they were just building things up as they went along
1121,startrek, what  the enterprise isnt in the lower decks finale  the titan is
1122,startrek,they sure did botch the nausicans and gorn though
1123,startrek,spoiler in the most recent episode other than michael burnham just die harding around the ship i loved the decision she made with stamets sonequa and anthony played those scenes beautifully i could really feel the desperation when stamets said “we still have time right now you and me let’s go” or when he shouted “we came to the future with you so you wouldn’t have to be alone we followed you hu followed you” and you could tell how painful it was for michael to eject him from discovery but and big but here michaels character has been the worst this season this whole it’s been a year spontaneous character development just feels awful every other character has had great character development but michael is just like this breaks all the rules one episode or she’s like just there it feels like her entire character is the fact that she’s evolved as a character but we still don’t see what that is personally i’ve loved season 3 so far but burnham has been my least favorite part so far and i don’t blame the actress it’s the writing that i hate
1124,startrek,&gt; cf orville and the alien in heated wasnt gay but it still worked on himthis makes no sense to me sorry i havent seen much of the orville &gt; gender isnt sex i might agree with you but thats a sensitive topic and star trek are going out of their way to be very inclusive and sensitive theres no way theyd tackle this topic in such a way i dont think they care about femmes fatales did you watch picard
1125,startrek,let’s take the typical conference room scene in tngyou have data operations/science worf security geordi engineering crusher medical and troi counseling and riker xo and maybe someone directly related to the problem with picard diplomacy usually they are solving a problem for one planet or the shipwhen has that *ever* happened on discoveryyou’ll get saru communication and michael science sometimes tilly more science and sometimes stamets spore science maybe vance diplomacy maybe georgiou oppression and murder or someone directly related to the problem hugh mostly hangs out in medbay and ends up cleaning up their mess often the overarching problem involves the whole multiverse universe or galaxy with the immediate problem being planet/ship relatedyes the crew is demographically speaking more diverse but the perspectives they show them bringing onscreen are less diverse half of them don’t even show up when they’re figuring out what to do it really cuts at discovery’s message of there being value in diversity due to differing perspectives when michael can singlehandedly solve the problems of the galaxy better than it can no matter what time period she’s inpicard does a pretty good job in *die hard in space* but that was just as much wit as actual fighting skills most of the time he isn’t shown having much knowledge of specifics about a subject area and his impact is fairly limited if he is acting purely on his ownditto for sisko who has more combat/engineering experience but less diplomatic experience but he simply cannot work at o’brien’s leveljaneway can help fix the warp core and has science knowledge and is perhaps more well-rounded but bear in mind people have a similar complaint about voyager centering too much around janeway seven and the doctor it’s not a complaint exclusive to discovery but still her staff meetings consist of everybodyalso people often fault tng for underutilizing crusher and troi
1126,startrek,this is a difficult one i forsure know that my top spot is ds9 and that my bottom spot is picard however i am not really sure i can rank the others because most of them are so close theres aspects in every trek that i like the only one i cant comment on is tas since i have not seen it if i had to rank:1 ds92 tng tos and voyager3 enterprise and disco4 lower decks5 picard theyre all generally pretty close theres still aspects of picard that i really enjoyed but they killed off icheb never going to forgive that one
1127,startrek,i agree but at this point id say relieving saru of command may be a good thing for him not sure hed take it that way immediately but he doesnt seem like one of those characters who would cling to command knowing hes not necessarily fit for it before his ship became the center of the universe he was a science officer onboard a science vessel i think hell be disappointed in himself but it doesnt have to create animosity between him and vance well see soon enough
1128,startrek,well good for you i cant watch it given it 3 tries but everytime burnham is so unlikable and mary sue i cant continue watching
1129,startrek,alright youre crazy but yeah that would be fun
1130,startrek,minimum i ask for a tv show/story is that it is believeable in the world it sets up i get why people like the show pretty lights attractive actors and action scenes i just expect more from star trek
1131,startrek,bring out the plot stretcher
1132,startrek,i mean what technological advantage do they have the federation is weak because of a lack of dilithium we have no indication their technology is weaker than the chain
1133,startrek,pizza time
1134,startrek,voyager is difficult for me because i believe some of its episodes are the absolute best that star trek has to offer but so much rubs me the wrong way a few of the biggest things are:* janeway is a horrible captain and person and i strongly believe she should be imprisoned along with archer and lorca for her many many horrific crimes * the rest of the crew has horribly inconsistent character development and chakotay in particular is one of the worst star trek characters ever while i enjoy the adventures that these characters go on i dont enjoy the characters themselves who i find mostly shallow or irritating or both * there are so many boring holodeck episodes that make voy one of the hardest star treks to binge* as well as having many of the best episodes of star trek voyager also has many of the worst if these are the voyages didnt exist the fight would be possibly the worst thing that was ever produced under the name star trek
1135,startrek,1 tng2 tos3 lds4 ds95 dsc6 voy7 pic8 tas9 ent
1136,startrek,first of all - what was that ending were we supposed to be hyped up by those stupid robots yeah let’s take the ship back teletubbiessecond - was any one else convinced the old media file that was so clunkily mentionedat the start was going to be die hard with michael in the vents and the losing her shoes hostages etc i thought she was going to tape a gun to her back still pretty good episode for me
1137,startrek,how would that even work
1138,startrek,i remember a discussion about this being a thing in combat situations when the captain cant leave the chair so he would order an emergency point to point transport of poop poop to point transport transport nr 2 to the recycling plant  has anyone seen my 2nd officer
1139,startrek,&gt; our favorite gay albino tartargrade google maps scientists
1140,startrek,personally i love discovery i probably would put it 4 though although season 1 and part of 2 were pretty boring imo only reason i got into it was because i saw an episode in season 2 rather than star season 1 but picard i can admit the plot was pretty boring in my opinion and the characters weren’t interesting entire thing felt like they were shoving old characters in your face
1141,startrek,1 deep space nine  2 tng  3 voyager  4 enterprise  5 discovery  6 tos  7 picard  havent seen the rest
1142,startrek,ds9- i don’t think anything will ever top it but i hope something does the gap between ds9 and the rest is wide and deep best characters in trek the most important aspect for medsc-characters are good like i really love themand stories are improving even though i liked the original setting i think the new one is doing better tng-my first trek will always have a special place in my symbiote pouch tos- almost seems wrong to put it so low might be tied with tng or dsc ent-best aesthetic of any trek like the pioneer vibe st-if every episode was calyspo or q&amp;a this would be higher now i ship number one and spock and i’m still not sure if it’s ok lds-its funny and it’s nice to see the tng aesthetic though i wish they would take more advantage of the animated medium i want to see some more crazy stuff pic- i really liked even loved the romulan stuff and most of the characters a lot of other stuff left me feeling kinda meh really dislike how jurati was handled and i’m disappointed that narek apparently won’t be back next season he’s off to plot with the parasitesfrom conspiracy i guess tas- if more episodes had the skorr their jihad and their ability to field 200 billion bird warriors in just two years this would be #1  i love how batshit crazy some of the episodes are voy-yeah i’m not sure it deserves the last spot but something has to go here i do like it the least out of all the treks but that doesn’t mean there’s not still a lot to enjoy but it’s not a “best to worst” it’s “best to lessbest but i still kinda dig it”
1143,startrek,the only excuse i can come up with is it’s a quirk of the new os and michael somehow knows how it’ll react
1144,startrek,1 deep space nine 2 next generation3 voyager4 enterprise5lower decks6 picard7discovery personally no 1 to 4 are amazing and very little in between them i ranked dsn higher the tng cause the characters were so well done from quark to garack and so many others the added so much more to the show the tng also dsn was more darker which i enjoyed a bit and think it showed a much more realistic captain in sisko rather than tng unealistic perception of a perfect captain in picard aswell as this i believe some of captain picards philosphies were flawed  enterprise is very underated and stands very well by itself but comparing to the other top 3 lacks the eloquency they had as with picard and discovery well lets just say id rather watch grass grow
1145,startrek,1 tng2 ds93 tos4 voy5 ent6 dis7 picreally cant judge tas ive seen two or three episodes at most havent seen any lower decks lower decks isnt available in europe yet
1146,startrek,now i understand the postthe way its written gave my eyes cancer apparently
1147,startrek,i havent forgotten that burnham is the main character of the show instead i think the ways she is shoe-horned into every plot are kinda ridiculous take the trill episode for example there really is no reason why michael is a better person to accompany adira to the planet than culber then we have the situation in the caves where its michael that has to talk adira through a complex trill joining process on the trill homeworld despite having zero knowledge about trillswith tng on the other hand picard was not only the main character but the captain of the ship it makes sense for him to be involved in most episodes given that hes the one running the ship and the ultimate source of authority and quite often he took a back seat while other characters were developed with episodes that centered around themdiscovery doesnt do that its all michael all the time i would argue that its gotten slightly better this season with 3x02 where she was only present for the final 10 seconds and the mirror universe episodes which were really a setup for a new show but generally the characters on this show exist to service michael
1148,startrek,if i can ask why is voyager so low it was the first trek show i watched from start to end and i loved it
1149,startrek,didn’t the actor get arrested for indecent exposer to a minor lol
1150,startrek,that whole thing was weird though the fact that  kes was nine or something
1151,startrek,1 tos2 ds93 ent4 tng5 voy6 tascant rank yet: disco pic lds short treks
1152,startrek,picard still has only normal human lifespan and theyre certainly not going to potentially screw up further seasons of picard but having the sudden reveal that he lives another 800 years because someone decided to rewire his bodyid be more willing to bet money that theyll have giant ethan peck show up as a clone of spock twoactually that would rule now ill be disappointed if thats not what happens
1153,startrek,or ye know you’re just completely wrong 🤷🏼‍♀️
1154,startrek,your spoiler tag isn’t working
1155,startrek,archer is out of the equation because those events were from before the federation charter was signed before the federation creation and starfleet charter was different that the federation charter  starfleet charter included the article 14 section 31 provisions 
1156,startrek,archer is out of the equation because those events were from before the federation charter was signed before the federation creation and starfleet charter was different that the federation charter  starfleet charter included the article 14 section 31 provisions 
1157,startrek,money doesnt exist inside the federation beyond when the federation needs to interact with a capitalistic society as seen multiple times in ds9 its presumed they use some kind of conversion rate to simulate a value for federation credits but i dont think thats ever stated in the core television canonthem being beyond capitalism isnt even subtext it is in the text the acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force of our lives we work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity that attitude is antithetical to the core capitalistic drive of well acquiring capital a post scarcity society does not need capitalism everyone can have what they want and if what they want effects other people they can argue and compromise and agree between each other as equalsim not saying its always perfectly represented in the show or that its not overly naive to assume wed ever get to a society as free as that but that is what star trek has been since its inception by roddenberry that filthy communist ;p
1158,startrek,andorians also looked better on that although lurians look great on disco
1159,startrek,i have to agree orions canonically are green humanoids so just paint the actors green why go through all the extra trouble 
1160,startrek,its easily in my top 5 trek episodes of all time
1161,startrek, what does sevens sexual orientation and vigilantism years later have to do with janeway also icheb was like a son to seven i believe there are plenty of parents who have avenged a childs death biological or adopted legally or perceived
1162,startrek,challenge acceptedappendix aappendix bthis one was also pretty good
1163,startrek,thats grand negus rom to you
1164,startrek,the federation and the klingons are allies for most of *tng* and *ds9* it should be noted that roddenberry originally wanted the klingons to be part of the federation as of *tng* but that idea was abandoned once he had less influence over *tng* due to poor health
1165,startrek,personally i feel discovery is so far away from where it needs to be it’s not even star trekwhat is star trek like how would you define what exactly makes star trek what it isto me star trek is an ensemble of people but into difficult situations that need to be solved with respect intellect and ethicsdiscovery has none of that the cast is essentially burnham phillipa who is just there to show burnham how to be a bad person to get things done saru who is just there to be a stickler almost an opposite to her to show her horrible behaviour might be better than star fleet regulations and tilly who is just there to try make burnham look fun when she’s not like at all now we have book i suppose but he’s an odd character he can talk to animals and it’s just been totally forgottenthe rest of the cast is literally completely replaceable as we have seen given the stupid deaths and removal of cool captains like lorca and pikethe show is not star trek it’s a cw teen drama series about a sociopath set in space - and to make people watch it they set it in the star trek universe like would anyone here watch this show if it didn’t have the star trek name attached i know i wouldn’t
1166,startrek,i like the way it leaves the question whether or not data had concluded fajo should die
1167,startrek,he led osyraa along for the whole time showed good faith had her believe she was inches from reaching her goal then he revealed that he knew from the start an given motivation of the other party her personal ambition and made his red line explicit and very clear thats a good negotiation tactic
1168,startrek,sarus about to lose his command did you not notice the expression vance made when osyra was telling him what happened and how saru had an ensign in charge that failed to keep her from taking discovery that was the expression of a man about to effect a change in discoverys commandit was a subtle expression but it was powerful
1169,startrek,thats not the janeway were talking about in the same degree kelvin spock isnt prime spock but its absolutely not something that counts in janeways favorand seven isnt a vigilante shes a commissioned officer of the fenris rangers she certainly has a higher mandate than picard at that point
1170,startrek,yes exactly this way just in a little more sophisticated way were all adults in the end and can handle more than simple black and white
1171,startrek,not quite their physical patterns were manifest in the holodeck leaving their neural patterns to be stored in the computer systems of ds9 the neural patterns took every bit of memory in every system across the station resulting in power cuts and virtually everything across the station inoperable they were in there for a matter of hours its a long way from keeping a backup of someones complete pattern within the transporter system again it was an emergency measure and not something that could be done as a matter of course they had no way of rematerializing those officers while retaining their patterns to be able to create another copy of them later on
1172,startrek,i like that you like it but you provide nothing to tell us why exactly is it the sets the story lines the characters the acting swear words incessant crying by all parties involved ;i could not progress past midway s02 so im curious to hear your thoughts i really enjoyed lower decks and i think thats because the secret is one-story-per-episode
1173,startrek,the kazon werent gonna start taking random ships for no reason not to mention i doubt they could have even figured out how to use the thing let alone maintain the tech
1174,startrek,thank you for writing this my wife and i have been calling it star trek michael for some time now we have watched all star trek series and movies sometimes several times and we also miss that sense of star trek sure enterprise before that had also lost a bit of that sense but then the show was meant to be a bit rough since there was no federation yetfrom a european perspective: i get that there is a culture war going on in the us and so they needed to put a lot of stuff in be it a female black lead an openly gay couple at least one trans actor depending on whether you count her vision or not and that would all be perfectly fine if those guys at least did something and were developedmichael is supposed to be a human child that grew up in vulcan when it suits the story she is vulcan and when it doesnt she is human other people here have written enough about her as a flawed character who would have lost her job long ago so i wont focus on that but what exactly is the point of the chief engineer now and what is his job exactly sure geordi was always the go to guy for everything and the distinction between science officer and chief engineer has always been rather hazy but damn he is basically reduced to being a father figure a husband and the guy who does things downstairs and there is this other engineer who is also kind of there to annoy stamets and other than that she does what exactlyand adira it seems like they decided to put her in at the last moment so she is always kind of there and gets to have some ideas but what is going on with her exactly i want character development i want to know how she plans to live on what she wants from life etc etc&amp;#x200b;i think the series problems are best summarized by lt nilsson: she is kind of there and apparently has an important job but i could not for the life of me tell you what she does and why an ensign was chosen over her sure i get it from the writers/producers perspective because the actress playing tilly checks of another box in the political correctness field but making her first officer and pretending that she is even close to being officer material or starship material just exposes the glaring weakness of structuring a show not around the science part of science fiction but around the fiction part
1175,startrek,lol
1176,startrek,i think pike out-federations janewaypike is cited in universe as the peak of morality to the extent of being ordered to take the enterprise away from the klingon war so the federations best would survive
1177,startrek,she still is an ensign “my number one ensign tilly” 😂&gt;basically michael mutinied again and saru sighed and picked tilly&lt;
1178,startrek,&gt; stormfront burnhamtheyve really changed over the centuries if theyll let her in
1179,startrek,i love discovery i really enjoy the darker approach theyve taken with it saru is one of my all time favorite characters theyve done such a wonderful job with him im awfully fond of michelle yeohs characters too because shes such a good actress i was really happy when i found out shes gonna be part of the cast
1180,startrek,she was the *’natural choice’* supposedlyi think in lore she is technically still an ensign and is just acting first officer still incredibly dumb
1181,startrek,ok ok i guess i must have misinterpreted that  thanks for the clarification
1182,startrek,haha i lile that thought would make for a interesting turn but i do doubt it
1183,startrek,found kira’s alt
1184,startrek,“computer deactivate the efh”
1185,startrek,barclay said computer end program and that was all she wrote
1186,startrek,borg really isnt a single full race though its just a mishmash of random assimilated races
1187,startrek,not necessarily with the prevalence of time travel and relativistic effects could be anybody who isn’t confirmed deadcould even be chris pine maybe khan’s blood made him immortal and he ended up in the prime universe due to an ion storm or somethingrobot picard soji
1188,startrek,*burnham begins crying from yet another emotional realization*
1189,startrek,no the khitomer accords is a treaty treaties are between different nation states why would the have had an officer exchange program in tng and why would worf being a klingon on a starfleet ship been a big deal if they werent separate states
1190,startrek,and his gf was fireeeee
1191,startrek,it crossed my mind during the episode something feels off about the holos the way that georgiou disabled them by blinking and now vance skirting around the questionsnot sure if anything will come of it but interesting theory none the less
1192,startrek,yes it is
1193,startrek,bla bla bla you missed the part where facts and real arguments were required
1194,startrek,though it’s not referenced directly as such kirk sits on a pop-out toilet in he spock and mccoy are locked in the brig in star trek v
1195,startrek,its control and will finally get the sphere data
1196,startrek,if the audience changes the show will change too and i like star trek the way it isso yes i prefer the type of fan who speculates about how the warp drive works rather than the type of fan who speculates about whether picards fish is polysexual its all about the tone of the show
1197,startrek,the first race that comes to my mind is vulcans if non-federation were included i think id vote for the borg
1198,startrek,i disagree completely but im glad somebody can enjoy it watch the critical drinkers video about discovery sums up what i think
1199,startrek,absolutely there’s just not the time to have filler episodes exploring a crew member’s childhood or a low-key episode giving a random side character a romance or whatever 15 episodes is only just over half what the other shows had to play with it is a different style of tv made in a different age we just need to accept that
1200,startrek,i don’t feel like anthony rapp or wilson cruz’s performances are any less committed they just don’t have as much leeway in the plot they’re given both pike and vance are supposed to command the scenes they’re in but stamets and hugh are often playing supporting rolesthis is kind of a consequence of burnham being the center of the show having to play a very staccato character and everyone else having to yield to her ultimately neither burnham nor whoever she’s interacting with really commands the scene because she’s constantly undermining everyone else’s authority without having her own
1201,startrek,really just the orion make-up lol not the klingon or carsassian
1202,startrek,yeah ikr one year and she doesnt know that earth and others have left the federation
1203,startrek,he was able to  keep the  holo sweets  running  with  some  spare parts  and a  spatula
1204,startrek,those experiences were the exception to the rules of those characters which made them so compelling for michael it’s just another tuesday
1205,startrek,she also disobeyed the omega directive by allowing seven to fartarse around with it in the vain hope it would stabilise as an energy source instead of just annihilating it immediately coulda screwed up a few sectors of space with that
1206,startrek,i stopped watching last season lol how the heck did tilly make fo she was an ensign correct
1207,startrek,play games and get a life
1208,startrek,i always saw the best of both worlds as more of a riker episode and needing to learn to grow beyond picard and be his own man while also embracing what picard stood for
1209,startrek,he was covering up his sadness by cheering the crew up
1210,startrek,welcome to star trek: online we havewars from almost all sidesdiplomatic solutionsa really well immersive storyline with actions that have consequences literally everything there is in star trek mediaupgradable techmiscellaneous tasks to perform on the shipability to play as different species in different factions in different time periodswhat els do you want
1211,startrek,the worst bit about episode 1 is that in the 24th century apparently theres no such thing as a timerlike they could have gotten home and blown up the array 🤣
1212,startrek,yes  but a bit of context here dax was joining in seeking vengeance outside of federation law in accordance with klingon law ditto klingon law with worf sisko would trial garak on what basis suspect you would need evidence quark went from being a petty criminal to saving the alpha quadrant by breaking the terok nor insurrection out of jail in sacrifice of angels janeway reconditioned an entire crew of terrorists with the xo becoming in many ways more starfleet than her mirror georgiou was a genicidal cannibalistic dictator it’s many leagues greater than any ‘evil’ we’ve seen from previous main characters the fact is that in each instance of when a star trek character has gone off the rails the camera hasn’t exactly portrayed this sympathetically in the pale moonlight is often cited as a dark episode and it was sisko committed and was complicit in murder and manipulated an entire empire to join a war to suit his agenda but the camera focussed in on how that compromised his soul actions have consequences sometimes you get away with it but if you are a good person it will take its toll on your soulwhereas discovery had a 2 parter with ending toast and heartfelt send off to a maniac and compromise the trek message because they want to cast her in a new series profit over purpose right there
1213,startrek,me too i really liked ryn i wish he had featured more
1214,startrek,i love the expanse  that being said that show its based on an existing book  it is incredibly executed though - cant say the same for other shows
1215,startrek,ds9 did a really phenomenal job of rehabilitating the ferengi after their awful misuse in tng quark and company are among my favourite characters on the show
1216,startrek,it needs to be on the uss titan i was disappointed that in picard it wasn’t
1217,startrek,i mean she did the most mental gymnastics to “stick” to federation principles that’s kinda the same thing
1218,startrek,kirk would kill it people deserve to be free to dowhattheywant with their lives whatabout humanity what about love
1219,startrek,bajor hired the federation to be its asset / property manager so the federation would be collecting rent if bajor demanded it or since the federation itself has no use for money sisko is merely pointing out that quark should count himself lucky to not be paying market rate for the space which i can only assume is probably a lot of gold pressed latinum per annum given the location of the station as the waypoint for the wormhole quark’s operating expenses are artificially low which allows him to make up the difference in pure profit - bars and bars of sweet sweet latinumthat’s all i can come up with
1220,startrek,presumably saavik was at least 50 years old that’s 30 more years life experience than tilly who has had some weird experiences on discovery but that hardly makes you command ready
1221,startrek,then it’s a good thing burnham didn’t bring her mom back from ni’var
1222,startrek,if you have to cry at every problem you have some long standing mental heal issues already
1223,startrek,i’m loving vance his stern and straight forward easily becoming my favorite admiral
1224,startrek,time travel stories are some of the best sci/fi stories ever told both in trek and outside of it it can work with any genre and set up genuinely emotional moments like seeing a family member you lost etc so hard disagree there-- time travel isnt the problem the problem is these writers are simply not capable of writing anything more than sloppy meandering mystery or one note sentiment they dont understand the setting or what made star trek endearing to begin with
1225,startrek,dont forget the button push
1226,startrek,oh that explains it  do they were just peaceful treaties  thankd
1227,startrek,i’m a president not a doctor
1228,startrek,oh yeah i like her shes the only character on the show whos not a complete cartoon  i also dont know her characters name
1229,startrek,something didnt sit well with me with how vances tone and demeanor changed when he started talking about osyraa being tried
1230,startrek,they were peace treaties from memory alpha:*the khitomer accords consisted of two historic peace treaties between the klingon empire and the united federation of planets and were the first step in reconciliation between the two powers**the first khitomer accords were signed at the khitomer conference in 2293 on the klingon planet khitomer*
1231,startrek,if its just watching him wake up and brush his teeth everyday i would be just fine with it
1232,startrek,i enjoyed that way more than the actual show
1233,startrek,what if it’s mr mot or chief o brien or q or michael burnham’s mom
1234,startrek,i dont play the game but mind sharing what happened  please
1235,startrek,she changed the timeline for own emotional needs
1236,startrek,do they share an alliance or something  i thought they joined the federation when they signed the khitomor accord
1237,startrek,std is an ok sci-fi show i just wish they would have made their own ip and let star trek be the shiny city in the hill it mostly was not just another serialized story about dystopian nightmares and the one savior
1238,startrek,no
1239,startrek,no the klingon empire is an independent nation
1240,startrek,bajor: india
1241,startrek,13 episodes of him at the deskin 8k
1242,startrek,probably the same way alexander was an adult by the age of 8
1243,startrek,only after sahil gets a spin off first
1244,startrek,sorry but people liking poop humor is yet another low point for discovery i like all sorts of low brow nonsense but star trek is not the vehicle for itmajor grin on youtube put together quite genius montage of past food moments picard making a toast to his crew in the context that they’re all drinking shit in-universe strange that 1000 years in the future the concept of replicators is something that can surprise the leader of a powerful organization
1245,startrek,watching the expanse i really start to understand the difference between good solid coherent writing in advance versus alright folks lets gather in a room and spit these ideas to the board and see what sticks oh also whats that website memory alpha pick a prior random episode to refer thats it were done
1246,startrek,i always think bad writing is a symptom of modern tv but youre right shows like the expanse are phenomenal
1247,startrek,thats jaresh inyo in ds9 here we are talking about the president in the 32nd century in discovery jaresh inyo had shortly resigned as we see in a later episode
1248,startrek,and archer threatened to knock tpol on her ass
1249,startrek,yes he was acting emotionally but his adopted kid and his husband were there and he’s the only one with the ability to get the ship there to save his family and the rest of the crew and the captain like michael chose to screw everyone over including saru and i’m so angry and hope this finale does some sort of something to fix the fuckups she’s caused this season
1250,startrek,ds9 season 4 episode 11 - homefront and 12 - paradise lost
1251,startrek,season 4 episodes 11 and 12
1252,startrek,yes she does when bajor is negotiating with the federation kai opaka comes to sisko in a vision and tells sisko that bajor mustnt join the federation
1253,startrek,very well put  if they had just put some effort into basic coherent writing and storytelling discovery could have been an amazing show  without that foundation nothing else really matters
1254,startrek,what i mean is that the ship simply does not have enough storage space on reserve to hold something as unfathomably complicated as all the data needed to rematerialize a living human without side-effectsthere are two main situations where you can store a persons pattern:1 in the pattern buffer this is where youre supposed to do it the pattern buffer is designed to store patterns but only briefly it has some prepostrous amount of storage space but cant hold that information for very long before the pattern degrades scotty somehow manages to keep the pattern stable longer2 in the ships computer this is only done in weird emergencies the ships computer is designed for longer-term storage so it can potentially keep a pattern stable for longer but the computer isnt designed for it and doesnt have the storage space to comfortably accommodate it it can work in a pinch but you may have to dump a shitton of data and software to fit the patterns inif you want to store that insane amount of data youll have to fill up the entire ships/stations computer which causes all sorts of problems when i said computer-intensive i was being rather vague but i was referring to the computers storage capacity rather than its computational capacity if you have to dump important data and software to keep a person alive in there well maybe thats necessary to save a life in an emergency but i wouldnt want to be doing it every time the away team beams downthe biggest refutation to what im saying is probably when voyager just straight up stores people in the pattern buffers to hide from some space nazis who kill psychics if you can just keep people in *the pattern buffer* which is only used for transporting people and wouldnt cause ship-wide problems well then youre onto something the pattern buffer is suggested to have plenty of space to store many patterns but its limitation is that it cant store people for long perhaps voyager has tweaked their transporters with nanoprobes or some shit they always seem to be tinkering away at something or otherpoint is its trek tech if youre looking for rigid consistency read an arthur c clarke novel or something broadly speaking storing patterns for any length of time is usually a crapshoot but the writers sometimes let it slide
1255,startrek,r/wolf359truth
1256,startrek,i’d argue that everything relevant to the plot in picard is explained within the show itself of course that’s not the same as understanding because you’ve seen what’s being referenced i just don’t think you *have* to watch the older stuff i watched with people that are much more casual than i am they didn’t remember that &gt; bruce maddox&lt; was from tng but they had no trouble following and enjoying the story  i’ve also seen posts on here that make it seem like it wouldn’t be the worst rust choice if that’s what the person really wants to watch with lower decks i don’t know i guess i agree there though i think that can be enjoyable as well without having an encyclopedic knowledge of star trek just maybe not *zero* knowledge
1257,startrek,you’re right it breaks the fundamental story telling principles of show and don’t tell there’s a reason why the mandalorian is such a smash hit for disney star wars and the newest trilogy of films isn’t they tell and they don’t show who and what the characters stand for
1258,startrek,imagine the pr a captain brings her crew 70k light-years largely intact with a ton of data about a part of the galaxy never visited with loads of technology never seen before after crippling the borg and starfleet demote her
1259,startrek,i think it was a couple of episodes into season 3 when someone commented on burnhams whisper-crying now i cant unsee it if the scene calls for even the slightest bit of sincerity she ramps it up to 10 with the strained voice and tears being shed ive run out of energy to waste caring about burnham and i really loved the show until season 3 i thought that jumping to the future would be the soft reboot the show needed to find its feet
1260,startrek,what
1261,startrek,fun fact: max grodenchik was a pretty good baseball player so they had to have him do everything the opposite way to make him a bad baseball player i think it would’ve been funnier to make rom unexpectedly good at baseball
1262,startrek,romrade
1263,startrek,theres a scene from babel where quark tells odo that rom fixed the replicators odo replies rom couldnt fix a straw if it was bentthat always stuck with me after we find out that rom is a great engineer
1264,startrek,replicators rearrange base matter into desired forms and substances when waste is provided replicators can re-arrange that into base matter for future use energy is required but so is base matter
1265,startrek,season 4 makes it worth it though
1266,startrek,the array was just a tool there no really much likelihood the kazon would start using it to pull ships from around the galaxy sheet the caretaker died
1267,startrek,quark’s too busy running his chain of bars
1268,startrek,i thought reunification iii was going to finally give us a more diplomatic-philosophical-courtroom drama-type episode but it just turned into another melodramatic therapy session for burnham
1269,startrek,&gt; every series is designed to be able to be watched with no prior knowledgethat probably doesnt really apply to picard or lower decks as much as the other series
1270,startrek,rom was called an idiot by quark because he didn’t have good business instincts but he wasn’t an idiot when it came to engineering
1271,startrek,so true i would have these three shows and others in my queue and discovery was the last thing i wanted to watch  it is a chore
1272,startrek,every day is leg day
1273,startrek,i agree i see a lot of people saying that voyager didnt get good until season 3 but i loved it from the first episode tng is my personal favourite but voyager has the most interesting premise of any star trek series and some of the best characters
1274,startrek,yeah people seem to forget even tng stumbled over hurdles during the first two seasons    and look how people talked about ds9 when it came out to how people love it now     every time new trek comes out it’s always taken time to be loved by fans   it’s the same with discovery   season three is the bomb
1275,startrek,alright i ruminated on this during the weekend to get my thoughts together and im going to say there isnt any nuance to the character because there is no real intention from either side for the character to change its obvious from start to finish that vance doesnt take ossyra seriously and that ossyra is in it for no reason except to serve herself and legitimize her empire and she isnt subtle about it i wish the writers could have actually committed to making her more complex but they throw it all out once she blasts ryn away for no reason other than to show she is in fact as one dimensional as we all expected they need her back in that spot for next week so we dont think about it when her and her goons are slaughtered by the discovery crew
1276,startrek,the only argument against the phaser is internal sensors but she had the drop on him could’ve nerve pinched him
1277,startrek,the president of that time is shown in ds9
1278,startrek,i think *tos* is the best place to start but the *tos* films or *tng* would also be reasonable starting places though i’d suggest watching “space seed” before *the wrath of khan* if you want to watch the *tos* films before most of *tos*
1279,startrek,even as emissary he didn’t get any special powers or abilities it didn’t fundamentally transform him as a person even when he learned to accept his role the most he got was somewhat unwanted attention from bajorans the rest of his experiences changed him from s1 sisko to s7 not his title
1280,startrek,if its a remake of anything its a remake of the last flight fromthe twilight zoneworld war i fighter pilot travels forward in time and discovers he needs to go back in time to save his flying partner
1281,startrek,thank you  /u/spartan2732 for the award much appreciated
1282,startrek,the problem has always been the writing  discovery had all the other ingredients for a great show but without a solid script theres nothing worth watching
1283,startrek,that would be insane
1284,startrek,yeah neelix kind of sucks but i still wouldnt mind if he accidentally replaced michael burnham
1285,startrek,yeah i realised i was truly done with discovery when after the end of season 2 i watched a random episode of ds9 in that random episode i cared more for the fate of a one episode character than i did for any character in disco michael burnham could die a horrible death and id just be like; oh okayit just never earned me caring about her
1286,startrek,burnham melodramatically stage whispering many of her lines has become another pet peeve of mine recently
1287,startrek,what if it is the borg queen
1288,startrek,i feel like theyre saving the federation president for a revealconsidering the timeline of events though options are probably very limitedthe doctor odo future guy q lore
1289,startrek,hes gone slightly mad and now works as a helicopter pilot for a crack commando group who now survive as soldiers of fortune if you have a problem and no one else can helpmaybe you should hire them
1290,startrek,replicators are energy intensive thats why they were rationed in voyager in year of hell chakotay replicates a pocket watch for janeway janeway tells him to recycle it because they cant spare the energy
1291,startrek,&gt;i’m glad discovery’s gapping asshole was a plot point that’s why you close the shuttle bay doorsim wondering how the managed to get a shuttle out  weve seen in previous episodes that books ship takes up most of the bay  the damage of that crash should have trashed the whole placeunless theres a second bay
1292,startrek,michael is whats wrong with the show we all hoped it would get better but they keep focusing on her over and over the mary sue stuff didnt get better it got worseits no longer star trek its set in the star trek universe and thats all we can really cling tothe team work elements are merely there to move us forward to the next michael nexus pointthey turned star trek into doctor who and as much as we know about the character i find myself caring less and less
1293,startrek,what’s so weird about that “relationship” is that getting a symbiont historically was the culmination of years of study and training and approvals i guess in their situation where there are less available viable hosts my question is: how old is grey 16 17 older i watch a lot of crappy television and teens doing the “love of my life” shtick is so blah meanwhile gray continues to show up without the methods jadzia and ezri used there is literally no precedent for this so i’m sure the writers are doing whether they want but it seems more like an inclusion angle rather than a story angle it honestly holds adira back because they need to move on and move up and clearly this is causing them some issue abs i’m sure in normal trek there would be a stand-alone episode about how they were able to finally make peace but here it will either be shoved in as a b story or not happen at all
1294,startrek,man i was astounded by how dirty they did tarses and for basically what amounts to corruption of blood a concept that was banned in the us constitution
1295,startrek,i really try to like it and mostly i do ok times have changed its more action and less memorable moments or even trek have to accept this and i can still go and watch old trek but i really start to dislike that emotional stuff like every 10 mins some drama tears and forced emotional stuff the more they cry the more i dont care really start to ask myself what im watching here bollywoodtrek some telenovela in space thats my main gripe but i will continue watvhing it cause there are moments the trek spirit shines
1296,startrek,sadly thats what i expected too  i can just see the writers congratulating themselves on that subtle twist
1297,startrek,not going to lie the oxymoron did cross my mind
1298,startrek,the big thing to note about barclay is that while hes socially inept hes still a fantastic engineer the whole episode introducing him revolves around these two facts that while he seems irredeemable there is still value to be found - and they dont even know about his actual talents because hes lacking confidence so much that he blunders constantly barclay also did one thing extremely well he managed to evoke a lot of empathy you feel for the character because if youve ever been awkward in a new environment youve been in his shoes multiple times if anything this brings out your point even more their attitude towards him is that every person has value and you should not dismiss them and instead try to nurture their growth compare this to discovery where they make fun of gene for mopping the floor yikes
1299,startrek,it doesnt make sense how would you know you would be sent to another quadrant just because you went in a storm
1300,startrek,probably something really important and maybe commanding his own science ship or research station people gave him a lot of crap for his unconventional methods but he did no harm and delivered results every single time he was one of the greatest heroes of the late 24th century and i hope he finally got the recognition and latitude he deserves
1301,startrek,im currently re-watching ds9 for the first time in a very long while im realizing that a lot of character arcs started developing quite early on i dont know if the writers knew where they would ultimately take them or not but they do a good job making it feel realin season 2 there was an episode where rom demonstrated that he can pick a lock or the electronic equivalent faster than quark on its own this is not a significant character development but it helps build the eventual foundation that rom is smarter and more skilled than he is generally given credit for
1302,startrek,but what if its more like landrew then data
1303,startrek,you hit the nail on the head  it baffles me that a tv show or movie can spend millions of dollars on special effects but not take the time to write a solid script
1304,startrek,tng - there are references to tos it’s over dramatic in the best ways but is an easy starting point voyager - minus a few nods to ds9 or tng most things in this show are new not only are they new to the audience but to the crew too so  it’s pretty easy for most people to follow alongenterprise - it’s the origin story per say everything is new for our protagonist so you learn about the final frontier as they dolower decks - full of references deep cuts and inside jokes it is written for fans but it stands alone the characters the story etc are written like any other adult cartoon and everything is introduced/written for that audience it makes the show a very natural and subtle transition into star trek for any fan of south park rick and morty etc
1305,startrek,i think that this kind of disregarding of criticism is really bad and leads to the split in the community were currently experiencing
1306,startrek,even if the romulan singularity drive does not use dilithium directly theyre going to need some form of power to create a singularity and dilithium could be involved in that process
1307,startrek,you can pretty much start wherever you want if you’re asking this question you’ve probably seen something that piqued you’re interest why not start thereevery series is designed to be able to be watched with no prior knowledge you can start with any of them if you’re starting with movies i would recommend going with chronological order another thing to keep in mind is that the three most recent movies starting with star trek 2009 take place in an alternate timeline than the rest of the shows and movies do it’s hard to make recommendations on a start place i think if you *really* don’t have any idea where to start the next generation or the original series are good bets
1308,startrek,nice
1309,startrek,the federation is centuries deep past ai intelligences being a big deal data and the doctor were accepted as individuals in their own time i doubt an ai rising to a high political office 800 years past that would be scandalous
1310,startrek,head of security but yes
1311,startrek,please dont include explicit spoilers for the most recent episodes in post titles
1312,startrek,i see a lot people with 55555 in their usernames are thai number 5 in thailand is “ha” so we use 555 as our version of “lol”
1313,startrek,yeah im sorry but i want to just say no to thisyou have a point and i like the comparison but people really need to stop saying x is just a remake/rip-off/copy of y when the two things *are nothing alike except in one-sentence high concept synopsis**its a wonderful life* and the short story *the greatest gift* is a christmas story about the importance of life every single life and valuing the impact you have on those around you and is preaching against committing suicideyesterdays enterprise is a time travel story about the impact of doing the right thing even in martyrdom and is ultimately about being willing to risk your life to do what is right because even if you may lose in the moment you may help set things in motion that will bring about a better future for the next generation pun intendedsaying these two are the same story except with minor tweaks is like saying cause and effect is just a rewrite of *groundhog day* with bill murray because theyre both time loop storiesjust because yesterdays enterprise and *its a wonderful life* both use the same story trope of showing an alternate future if x didnt happen or y didnt exist doesnt make them the same story with different names
1314,startrek,next gen when the whole crew devolves  troi is a fish creature in her bathtubin voyager bellanas sonic showers a few times
1315,startrek,what is green
1316,startrek,anyone else feel like michael has become a bit one dimensional now she never does anything out of the ordinary and even the crew expects her to save the dayi love the increased focus on the crew and exterior characters but its making me want to skip over any scene shes inall these comments are about vance and ossyra - instead of michael/books relationship growing or the call to her mom/shrug
1317,startrek,qaplá
1318,startrek,theyve been dancing about outright saying how the replicators work for decades  it was nice to hear someone just come out and say it
1319,startrek,op is a cbs shill
1320,startrek,this is not really aimed at op but i honestly  think these threads go nowhere - they always just devolve into the old days were betteri have never seen a single one that i think is a good representation of this forum they are more suited to r/startrek
1321,startrek,star trek the next generation episode 3x4: “who watches the watchers” is entry point for newcomersif you want to really start with the classics from the 1960ties i would recommend “balance of terror” the original series 1x08if you have really have time and like what you see watch all 178 episodes of “the next generation” first watch the sequel series later
1322,startrek,actually they do use waste and break it down to its fundamental atoms thats literally what roms job was when he quit quarks bar waste extraction
1323,startrek,appreciate you posting this i love all star trek except tos just don’t love it but i’m 36 it was before my time i was obsessed with ds9 when it aired and still am i find myself getting short of breath with discovery episodes this season in a good way i tear up i love it i also loved picard and lower decks i just love star trek and am here for any and all versions of it except jj abrams fuck that
1324,startrek,voy s4 is the best
1325,startrek,i’m pretty sure he hasn’t seen the episode as many times as we have in fact as far as the overall story arc he likely has no idea about the whole yar situation throughout the show
1326,startrek,well if you don’t want to understand the point and just think it’s “disco sux” then finefirst of all tos lacks modern storylines that focus on relationships and character development so you don’t have a primary focus on kirk’s family/relationships his emotions or dialogue between other characters focusing mainly on him he has no permanent relations outside the crew on screen that influences the show even in for example the conscience of the king there is very little talk about kirk’s actual reactions to the massacre on tarsus iv or what it was like kirk isn’t the one who wants revenge or wrestles with that it’s another member of the crew in the menagerie kirk has to make decisions but the story is obviously not about him emotionally in balance of terror he’s the strategist but it’s spock who wrestles with suspicion from other crewmen and eventually saves the ship by firing the phasers any other of the more modern treks prove my point in none of them is one character continually written in as the center of everything because they are ensemble type series picard is different and that’s obviously because it’s supposed to be about him discovery is pitched and cast as an ensemble type show and written like a show centered around a single character it’s jarring
1327,startrek,yeah i like neelix  i take the friendliness at face value  its a different vibe than all the rest of star trek  all the various crews are friends sure a few ds9 conflicts aside but theres always this professional and command-rank distance between them  neelix cuts past that his personability feels genuine  i can see where some find him annoying but id be happy to be on a ship with him
1328,startrek,look once kess was gone and he stopped being a raging abusive boyfriend the character got better
1329,startrek,im going to be super pissed if vance dies or turns out to be a bad admiral
1330,startrek,i’ve heard him say on the the next conversation podcast that he didnt know what was going on because he wasn’t part of the production and was barely in it it’s not like dude sits around binging the show over and over like us fans he’s literally busy directing other television shows listening to garrett wang and robbie mcneill reminisce about voy on their podcast makes me realize that for actors it’s largely just a job especially early on those guys barely remember anything about the early episodes the huge this for a great gimmick on the pod they start each episode by saying what they remember or think it’s about then they pause recording and go watch the episode it’s interesting to see how wrong they are in their memories of the episodes
1331,startrek,ive watched every episode of discovery and had to google who airiam is its series 3 and im still left wondering who the fuck are half these people&gt; i really really want to like the show but in my minds eye tillys promotion exposed the major flaws of the current writing style to me and it has not come back from thathere here she was promoted because her character has a name and is on screen thats it thats the entire reason why she was promoted
1332,startrek,right ok ill give you that one
1333,startrek,now i have a phaser ho-ho-ho
1334,startrek,your comment made me think of how many times i was stoked to see a new form of tech in star trek and there are a lot of one off things that are used to serve the plot of the episode: the spatial trajector or slipstream for example characters were excited about the possibility for story reasons but i guess i felt that as a viewer it was secondary or even tertiary  with all the extra 31sr century tech around it feels so front and center and that’s after a whole thing with the one of a kind spore drive
1335,startrek,this is an interesting post for me ive taken a long break from star trek this new iteration has lost me in terms of being a current fan in the past i would have probably tried to argue that the old seasons and this new star trek cant compare to one another but honestly if you like discovery good on you i think they should have started with season three and ditched all of what happened leading up to that but sadly they did not so all the previous happenings are stuck to them like wet moldy stickers but im just starting season three so my opinion could change open mind and all that -- from the not caring anymore
1336,startrek,i dunno
1337,startrek,piss up a rope youre up shits creek with a turd for a paddle
1338,startrek,voyager/janeway stopped any more ships being stranded by the array sacrificing one ship to save many others even if theyre an unknown race is the most starfleet thing ever
1339,startrek,well the overall mood is like doctor who
1340,startrek,they did actually
1341,startrek,from tillys initial reaction to georgious calling tilly sarus walking command blunder who will kill  everyone on board to osyraa making fun of tilly for captaining discovery the writers havent been at all shy about calling out *sarus decision* to make tilly his first officer
1342,startrek,sure im not questioning that im questioning when you wrote this &gt; both use different premises for the same end trek gives us the consistent characters so we dont waste time explaining who everyone is doctor who does the same but using one character they use multiple characters to do that in dr who
1343,startrek,ok done 
1344,startrek,yo i’ve watched this ep twice is stamets dead i’m so confused if he is i’m done
1345,startrek,depends if the temporal prime directive was in place in the 2370s because in endgame she right royally fucked over an entire timeframe just to save a few crewmates only for one of those crewmates to suddenly become a lesbian vigilante murderer but hey ho live and learn
1346,startrek,agreed and it’s a great shame i wanna find out more about owo and the rest of the gang i would love to think that maybe they’ll make time for this kind of character development in later seasons but i’m doubtful
1347,startrek,of course they are
1348,startrek,i’m australianthere was swearing in nutrek i didn’t hear a single instance of cunt or the real swear words where you combine swear words fuckwit shitcunt etcthis is a totally valid sentence in australian english: “oi which one of you bastards called this bastard a bastard”
1349,startrek,i remember more one off character names than the regulars in dis
1350,startrek,no longer idiot brother
1351,startrek,i would love to see her have a regular conversation about something like pretzels with tilly without getting emotional
1352,startrek,compare it to ds9 they have clear roles and clear reasons why they are there bashir deliberately didnt come top of his class because he wanted to work on the front line kira is second in command because she is a military representative for bajor which she earned through her time in resistance sisko didnt want to be there but after meeting the prophets and becoming the emissary in the opening two parter came to love the place and wanted to stay so on and so forthid add on all of the interpersonal relationships odo and kira odo and quark jadzia and quark quark and rom rom and chief obrian chief obrian and julian bashir bashir and garak so on and so forth you have these little relationships with their own mini stories garak and bashir have lunch together odo loves kira both rom and nog want to work with the chief and learn from him but in very different waysnow look at discovery there is some of this but its so wafer thin
1353,startrek,i enjoy discovery i enjoy that sometimes crew other than tilly saru stamets and booker get lines sometimesi enjoy that a characters motivation changes depending on what the episode needs i enjoy that we see michael well up every week i enjoy that we get a real character insight for the first time in an episode where that character leaves for good
1354,startrek,they do but their main function was to ask questions for us
1355,startrek,there was zero chemistry between neelix and kes i think the forced relationship also contributed to the negative image i liked him on many occasions he was not completely annoying
1356,startrek,don’t know why you were downvoted for this - sounds pretty spot on
1357,startrek,it’s literally like the entire ship is crewed by s1 harry kim’s
1358,startrek,discovery season 3 in particular has been amazing i absolutely love it
1359,startrek,everything you said has put my thoughts and feeling perfectly in to words i just read through the best 100 comments and all these points are correct and adding them up makes me feel even more mad i dont want to watch discovery anymore but then again ive watched everything else star trek related can somebody tell me this is an alternate timeline that wont matter in the future pleaseanyways just wanted to add that im with you guys and i am 100% certain that even if the non trekkies watch this show and think its decent entertainment discovery will go down as some of the worst star trek i also think it has almost no rewatchability value
1360,startrek,but osyraa is queen of the deadpan delivery it fits
1361,startrek,while i did find him kind of annoying i do respect the fact that his role aboard the ship was critical - not only did he prepare food for the crew but he was also their entertainment and events planner unofficially of course and played a vital part in keeping the crew’s spirits up during some of the darker moments of the journey unlike wesley crusher neelix doesn’t go around single-handedly saving the ship and the universe every wednesday so he’s got that going for him
1362,startrek,all admirals were captains at some pointand yes it is relevant if admirals arent any worse than the average starfleet officer even if that average isnt 100% ethical
1363,startrek,please revise your post title to be less spoilery
1364,startrek,yeah agreed there is a episode in tng where they pick up people from the 21st century or so and the way picard deals with them is just weird and not appropriate for someone like picard
1365,startrek,im sorry but no
1366,startrek,to be fair thats a problem that goes back to tos rodenberry was actually *in* the navy but apparently never grasped the differences in the purposes and functions of officers and enlisted resulting in the enterprises floors being scrubbed by officers who were trained for years to lead as a matter of course graduating from west point is basically getting a four year college degree in army command yet rodenberrys equivalent institution qualifies you for virtually nothing
1367,startrek,only if lone starr owes you a million space bucks too
1368,startrek,are you talking about kai winn or kai opaka the one before her
1369,startrek,season 3 has been really good and felt like trek the most
1370,startrek,its an excellent tv show i love it i like it just as much as i do tng its the best part of my week lol and i watch each episode several times its made a few of my friends into fans
1371,startrek,the companions do function for more than just that they get their own plotlines story arcs and development
1372,startrek,i liked his character arc how he evolved and matured as he learned star fleet ethics and morality he began as a nuisance but became a valued member of the crew
1373,startrek,i prefer the later seasons of voyager after season 4 when the crew is more settled gotta love fairhaven
1374,startrek,i tend to agree with this viewpoint we don’t know exactly what state romulan starship manufacturing was in immediately after the supernova sure we see romulans in picard but aside from a fleet of kinda flimsy looking ships we simply don’t know whether or not the artificial singularity technology remained viable that technology could’ve simply been unique to the d’deridex class as no other romulan ship class has been stated to possess a singularity drive
1375,startrek,glenn and neville would have a lot of bad things to say about their choices and spending way too much time and effort without actually creating a good effectand poor michael would just be like what are you doing
1376,startrek,it still could have been done in those shows with enterprise ending in 2005 and in the movies: 2009 2013 and 2016 they had a lot of opportunites all we got was a frame in which sulu was shown from afar to have a family with a man whose name or face we dont even know
1377,startrek,tried to establish more ships in the delta quadrant i would say
1378,startrek,that thing with icheb yeah that didnt happen i refuse to acknowledge it
1379,startrek,&gt;i have a feeling the most “federation” captain wouldn’t break the prime directive when it felt “necessary”not archer he raided another ship in the expanse he said some pretty mean stuff about vulcans too and with pjem aswell
1380,startrek,i actually would like this one to be true i feel like lwaxana would be the one to fully bring him out of his shell
1381,startrek,yes captain janeway even in the worst of times stuck to the rules when she could have abandoned them without questions asked she stuck to them the other captains i know archer and picard may have been less law-abiding in this scenario archer actually raided another ship in the expanse
1382,startrek,aye its a shame because the cast are high quality same with discovery
1383,startrek,luke skywalker would appear with baby yoda out of the blueit would be awesome
1384,startrek,they would be mad not to offer him a role maybe they’re saving him for later seasons or perhaps he’ll make an appearance in st picard at some point i really hope he makes an appearance
1385,startrek,post doesnt mean anti were post-swords but not because were anti swordthey just grew beyond the need for capitalist structures with the invention of fusion and the replicator its not a rejection just an evolution  they also grew past the need for socialism too so you could say its equally a rejection of that in a post-socialist societyin fact the real world political-economic philosophy it most resembles is extreme libertarianism
1386,startrek,neelix always was a boss
1387,startrek,in *voyager*s endgame which takes partially in 2404 5 years after the events of *picard* barclay is teaching at starfleet academy he no longer stutters unless caught in a lie hes markedly more confident and more closely matches the various idealized holographic/holodeck/alien-upgraded versions of himself we see throughout tng and voythis is an alternate timeline of course but its one based on the same barclay we see throughout *voyager* so its not too much of a stretch to think that its a fairly accurate representation of how he turned out
1388,startrek,still can’t decide how i feel about osyraa one the one hand i’m glad that the writers are giving her at least complexity by showing her relationship with aurellio but i’m also worried that she might just turn out be yet another one dimensional villain - we have enough of these already
1389,startrek,the difference is that companions serve to be the audience representation in the narrative so ask questions of whats going on
1390,startrek,i love the theory that he is a quite capable smuggler and trader his constant work throughout the series is why they never run out of shuttlecrafts of course captain janeway could never admit to employing someone with such a disreputable occupation so she gave him the title of morale officer - a role that he is clearly terrible at
1391,startrek,this is the central weakness of serial vs episodic/adventure of the week characters not named burnham dont really get episodes - ergo we learn nothing about them and they are never developed just become the background decoration
1392,startrek,i love discovery  i also don’t mind if other people don’t like it  personally i couldn’t stand voyager so i know how it feels to dislike a trek show
1393,startrek,its not bad you can run around some of the sights like deep space 9 which is funbut i hit a  difficulty spike in leveling a while back so i gave it up for a while maybe they changed it with more updates now lbutits free to play sothere is no risk in trying out  loli am sad they got rid of the foundry though such a stupid move one of the coolest featuresback in the day it had an in game editor where you can make your own missions and share it with others in the gameit was really coolbut not anymorebut still fun to try out none the less
1394,startrek,i have watched trek since the 80s tng was my show many of my friends are also trekkies; some of them prefer tos all of us watch and enjoy discovery it may not be our favourite series; mine is ds9 but we all agree season 3 of discovery taking trek to where it needs to be
1395,startrek,agreed
1396,startrek,time will tell but i believe so imo the reason most other shows took a couple of seasons to really get going is because it takes a while to iron out who the characters are and how they play off of each other no reason to believe discovery is any different
1397,startrek,
1398,startrek,i mean if this is still the same star trek as tng it most certainly is post-and therefore anti capitalist picard and riker had at least three speeches about it :d
1399,startrek,i dont really like the way duo-lingo teaches languages it is designed for people who dont know much about linguistics it also does not use ipa transcription
1400,startrek,to an extent yes but the show was not *about* him and the show shifted focus to spock considerably after nimoys performance became wildly popular
1401,startrek,because enjoying the show doesnt mean it has no issues with the writing i for one enjoyed watching the kelvin movies even though im also frustrated by the many lens flares and questionable plot points its the 6th series already the excuse that star trek only becomes good after 2 seasons should not be valid anymore
1402,startrek,&gt;so youre saying it would be okay if there was no kirk no picard sisko janeway archer i cant see how that would make sense with all the storylines that weve had over the yearswell no obviously im not saying that if you were to just delete those characters from the show and leave it at that the shows would still work there wouldnt be a captain of the enterprise - the should would become a joke with an empty chair in the middle of the bridgewhat im saying is that lets pretend were creating tng back in 1986 were writing our characters and were starting with the captain but instead of creating jean-luc picard we create vladimir koskova a russian and hes not just picard with a different name and accent hes a different character alltogether: unlike picard hes a family man with a wife and a young child both posted on the enterprise and unlike picard hes not quite at the prime of his career but rather a rising star - hes cocky full of drive - intelligent and diplomatic like picard yes but perhaps with something left to prove and more to lose he still drinks teaif we did that the show would get a very different dynamic than it did in real life koskova would interact with riker and worf and data in different ways to picard so we would have to approach those relationships anewbut how much of the show itself would actually change would some stuff of course samaritan snare family tapestry are all episodes written \*about\* rather than simply featuring picard and those episodes would make no sense with koskova just like wrath of khan is written \*about\* kirk rather than simply featuring himbest of both worlds would get a different dynamic what with koskovas wife and child being on board as he gets abducted but apart from that nothing would really change bobw is not a picard-focused episode its all about riker and the borg didnt kidnap picard because there was anything special to him but because he was the captain of the flagship koskova would still be thatthere is nothing inherent to picards character that is needed for tng to work hes well-written and the cast is well-balanced once they iron out the kinks after a season or two but the show is not \*about\* picard a handful of episodes would either need drastic re-writes all would obviously require \*some\* degree of re-writing or get thrown out completely if we replaced him with koskova but thats alli maintain the same is true of voyager and ds9 with archer i would consider the argument that his backstory with his dad and his subsequent prejudice against vulcans is important to the show so poooossibly archer is actually integral to enterprise sisko is a grey area to me his character is very much one which informs his approach to the station and bajor but again theres nothing in the show that \*requires\* that the commander of ds9 be a widower or have a son yes jake does get a bit of a storyline that makes a little less sense if hes not the son of the commander maybe not sure again id listen to arguments on thisbut if you did the same to discovery it falls apart \*immedeately\* you cant change who burnham is because the show is \*about\* her in a very distinct way if you replace her with someone who isnt spocks adopted sister you have no season two arc if she doesnt come in as an outsider half-vulcan most of season one doesnt work if her mother wasnt the one with the time-travelling suit again season two falls apart discovery is written \*about\* burnham in a way no other star trek show was written \*about\* the captain the captain was just an important character some episodes were written about them just like some episodes were written about every character on every show and most movies focused heavily on picard especially but the shows didnt orbit around them
1403,startrek,by that then disco is a victim of shortened season length
1404,startrek,nah dont its fine
1405,startrek,uhhh vancing with the stars
1406,startrek,uh oded fehr isnt white my dude read his name think for a second
1407,startrek,the reaction to neelix and specifically his relationship with kes are perfect examples of how star trek fans didn’t listen for the first 30 years and still aren’t listening now
1408,startrek,&gt; yes were three seasons in to discovery and i still couldnt tell you the name of half the bridge crewthis so much this i know the secondary characters on the orville better than i know any of the ~~bridge officers~~ background decoration on discovery
1409,startrek,a cadet crew doing a tour of the federation still wouldnt have been going faster than warp 5 for most of the trip
1410,startrek,as preposterous as the whole situation is i will give the writers credit for memory alpha’ing the fact that quantum slipstream requires benamite crystals which are even more rare than dilithium this was established in voyager and repeated by booker in discovery
1411,startrek,mother horta
1412,startrek,female what are you a ferengi
1413,startrek,hes the federation transporter expert
1414,startrek,there is some scene in ds9 where sisko does the same more or lesshe rages about the fact that the admirals on earth dont understand whats going on in the neutral zone not sure which episode it is but i think season 2 or 3
1415,startrek,hopefully he’s in charge of some starfleet think tank where he’s given the resources to do what he wants and doesn’t have some dumb admirals questioning him for results all the time
1416,startrek,or the many helmsmen on tng
1417,startrek,i think theres some change but its also not star trek i just think it vibes with the other shows more than this new shit
1418,startrek,i love the sort of continuation of it in sto
1419,startrek,most of them are honestly blindly following the brigading of bad reviews by many of those who stormed it with bad reviews before it even was released
1420,startrek,sure i just expected the chain operated a lot more like the syndicate did from what we saw in ds9s honor among theives it seemed like each market was run fairly independently like a cell with the main shotcaller bringing people in and up and paying tithes up the chain that they had established a presumably representative democracy with a congress and a constitution was far more organized and arguably legitimate than wed been led to believe rather than the federation fighting a strong private league it was more like they were fighting a breakaway state
1421,startrek,get the fuck out of here with that jk rowling shit
1422,startrek,mirror georgiou would have taken their ship in the commotion
1423,startrek,either way its downright depressing that someone who has seen so much star trek believes they have authority over what is and isnt they should try learning some of the values and lessons that trek teaches
1424,startrek,&gt; the orville has scratched my 90s trek itch its just sad the genuine article cant recapture the magic of what wasi liked orville for the first season but quit because the fans were just so toxic i unsubbed from /r/theorville after nearly every post was std suxxorz and anyone disagreeing was downvoted and harassed
1425,startrek,contrary to popular opinion nilsson did not just appear out of nowhere she was shown from the start of the season as being part of stamets’ spore drive team airiam’s job was spore drive operations officer so when airiam died it was nilsson who took over her position in ‘the red angel’ if you want to question something &gt;the group of bridge officers locked up in the ready room included some random woman who doesn’t have any lines and not nilsson suggesting maybe sarah mitich wasn’t available for the episode&lt;
1426,startrek,first off youre the only one talking about her sex if you want to bring up red herrings  its got nothing to do with it since a male admiral wouldve been equally wrong to say it in the same circumstancedata was different because it was - as i already explained - done as an *aberration*  the whole joke was he said something he shouldnt have  the joke falls apart if you try to cite it as evidence of normalized cursing in trek  youre likewise defending clancy as normalizedif the scene had somehow presented her verbiage as wrong or out of place then it would be different but it didnt it was just cursing
1427,startrek,youre going to love it
1428,startrek,i watched ds9 and voyager when they first ran and watched crappy vhs recordings and theres a lot of discovery that i absolutely loveburnams no janeway thoughoverall i really like it its flawed but i suspect given enough time well see like star trek: spock as some reboot project in like 2040s and a bunch of this is awful why isnt it like discovery posts
1429,startrek,yes this is what frustrates me about this whole postits completely ignoring all the faults of the old shows while over-playing the faults of the new showsare the new shows fault-less no but they shouldnt need to be 100% perfect theres no such thing as a perfect trek series they all have their faultsi love discover lower decks and picard for what they are imperfect but still great additions to trek canon just like every show that came before them and they all arguably had a stronger start than tng apparently the most sacrosanct trek did in its first couple seasonsi dont expect everyone to like them but when they trot out the same tired old valid criticisms over and over and over again i question their validity if they arent also still criticizing the old shows for the same
1430,startrek,after watching the scene where odo is knocked out i was confusedlets consider it would be possible to knock him out there is no reason why he would stay in his humanoid form
1431,startrek,isnt that too obvious though that starfleet hq is all thats left of a functional central governmentplus how would that even work if the remaining member-worlds think theyre still democratically electing a civilian president
1432,startrek,yes that’s it just couldn’t name it
1433,startrek,we are upside down
1434,startrek,the ferengi alliance is only the ferengi home world and a few moons
1435,startrek,cheesman’s character is specifically identified as the mirror airiam just for the record
1436,startrek,“obtusely deconstructionist” what is this some jerry falwell moral panic instigation moreover that’s strongly fallacious *ad populum* once again founded in nebulous and incoherent moral reasoning among many audiences especially evangelicals goddamn is just as heinous if not more so as it’s seen as taking god’s name in vain so once again you agree—you don’t mind if the men and the male presenting android swears but when the “bitch admiral” does it hooooo lordy we have a problem that’s the point that i’m getting at; trek writers love to position powerful women in a negative way when really they’re just doing their jobs and/or dealing with male subordinates who are being shitty to them the “angry woman” trope extends far beyond trek lore and takes on other dimensions like the “angry black woman” trope misogynoir clearly you’re continuing with bad faith interpretations one can offer commentary about the overwhelmingly male writers writing scripts for women characters and offer different commentary about specific character’s behavior in a given moment this is a non-issue and a red herring
1437,startrek,i’m 41 so i know where you are coming from i find it weird the revisionist history that is going on with ds9 and now voyager as i remember being treated like an idiot for enjoying those shows at sci-fi conventions when i should have been watching babylon 5 and later battlestar gallactica which i watched too because you are capable of watching more than one show for as lauded as tng is i feel the first two seasons are generally the worst star trek has been even those seasons had their moments i feel star trek appears on the right path as it seems to be getting a marvel type treatment where they are releasing shows for different types of fans who will watch the ones they prefer and the hardcore fans will watch them all like we always do something like discovery fits really well in that plan as the flagship trek picard has the fan service lower decks the casual fans and we’ll see where each new one slots
1438,startrek,a religious person making a vague prediction does not count as a plot hole
1439,startrek,its kinda funny or sad that on a show that goes out of its way to not have any straight white male main characters the show keeps getting stolen by the straight white male guest characters or at least not overtly queer yet in vances case anywaylorca pike now vance - every season people are calling for a spinoff :
1440,startrek,sub rosa is a special kind of awful but i cant agree on remember me that episode is a great character piece a solidly written bottle episode and gives beverly one of tngs greatest linesid say suspicions is also a pretty great episode and beverly-heavy episodes like cause and effect ethics and attached are fan favouritesi love beverly crusher and always wish wed gotten more of her than we did but she has some rock solid episodes that tell us tonnes about who she is and what matters to her
1441,startrek,maybe he runs his own science research vessel/station considering he was able to contact voyager maybe he was promoted in some wayprobably still a wreck though
1442,startrek,actually alex kurtzman here was referring to two new and unannounced shows in development and made clear he was not talking about section 31one of them has been announced to be strange new worlds but we got to wait for that other show
1443,startrek,you can see them fighting in their liquid forms in star trek online they can be pretty bad ass
1444,startrek,it’s not a plot hole its extremely difficult to synthesize maybe to the point where it’s not worth the trouble we k or they tried alternative means of ftl travel and they didn’t work i wouldn’t be surprised if quantum slipstream was one of those to say that is shouldn’t be a problem to synthesize it  is an assumption based on facts we don’t have the last information we had on the process had it taking *years* to do properly and after that the crystals decayed quickly i’m going to need a source on where people are zooming around without a care with quantum slipstream because the only information we havevia book implies that it’s just as if not rather than dilithium we haven’t seen people using it because it’s scarce and extremely hard to synthesize
1445,startrek,i like it is it great no is it season 8 of game of thrones no is it more star trek than weve had in years yes it shouldnt be immune to criticism but we should also realise that this show has to appeal to more than just trekkies to survive being canned also saru is amazing
1446,startrek,its clearly foreshadowing for the burn turns out a federation ship triggered their fire suppression system which caused all the ship ais to fight fire with fire igniting their dilithium cores to quickly consume all the nearby oxygen and choke out the fire
1447,startrek,slightly off topic but more of a big-picture statement as it relates to star trek the quickest way to improving the storylines of all star trek series moving forward are to ban the following tropes:1 time travel 2 secret organizations within secret organization behind everything3 holosuite accidents and intriguei could settle for the odd photonic life episode but the first two are the death of star trek right now the writers need to be handcuffed and get more creative
1448,startrek,someone once told me this and its always stuck with me janeway shouldve been demoted once they returned to earth for getting her crew stranded in the delta quadrant
1449,startrek,i went from tng to vog and loved it janeway was so good pity she get meaner in prison :- otnb
1450,startrek,i think i was happier not knowing that the actor who played riker doesnt like one of the most beloved and re-watched episodes of tng
1451,startrek,comrade rom
1452,startrek,it does not make any sense in star treks tech based world replicators produce matter from energy the limiting factor is energy which they have in abundance due to fusion power and other ways of energy production even without matter/amtimatter the reason the ufp was quasi non capitalist was that it had become a post scarcity society due to its technology and that was not depending on space travel but on their capability to produce energy its just another plot point that shows the writers do notunderstand trek lore
1453,startrek,my presumption was that it’s actually vance i feel like “who’s the president going to be” is just fan-hype
1454,startrek,neelix is a ride to die talaxian
1455,startrek,yeah he’s downright amazing i loved that scene in an ideal world they are both right but in this reality they cannot be - the mission comes first
1456,startrek,that would be amazing
1457,startrek,the ferengi had the rules of acquisition - you knew what you were getting with them if you were familiar with the rulesemerald chain not so much it seems
1458,startrek,if it was book on the planet though i feel like burnham would put everything at risk to save him
1459,startrek,dude thats just gross why make it personal
1460,startrek,but it’s not dilithium benemite can be synthesized and i’m sure with the technology of s3 it shouldn’t be a problem it’s just a silly plot hole “without dilithium we can’t warp” meanwhile slipstream is flying around without a care
1461,startrek,the valiant is the same class as the defiant which has a maximum warp of 95
1462,startrek,rip ensign ricky
1463,startrek,well although its actually just a figure of speech she was actually rightaccording to the bajoran belief a bajorans pagh is coming from the celestial temple is regularly replenished from them leaves the body after death and reunites with the prophets in the celestial temple and in case opaca finally is able to die without being restored by the microbes of the penal moon her pagh returns to the templesisko is partially a prophet and in the temple with the prophets after he fulfilled his task as there is no time in the temple it doesnt matter when opaca actually dies: opacas pagh is in the temple when sisko is in the temple with the prophets
1464,startrek,doubtful voyager is the best at anything
1465,startrek,see i don’t know about that stamets clearly couldn’t see the big picture because he could only focus on his loved ones michael has shown before that she’s able to remain somewhat aware of the overall mission
1466,startrek,varian my king
1467,startrek,is it a normal dog be like ensign tendi and name it the dog
1468,startrek,fuck is widely held to be the strongest general curse word ie not overt hate speech or anything in american society  if you reject that then youre being obtusely deconstructionistyes exactly - it was a malfunction swearing is supposed to be something that didnt happenand im confused on the one hand you seem to be defending her f bomb as an acceptable way to express angerbut then you also decry having an angry cursing woman as playing into sexist stereotypes  are you saying she shouldve said it or notagain no one is saying she didnt have a legitimate reason to be upset  just that wasnt the right way to express that to the audience
1469,startrek,here we go again
1470,startrek,naw janeway lost it in episode 1  whats that you say i can get my crew who i am responsible for home probably but it would mean a race i dont know or care about is gonna get tech that isnt mine that they would have gotton anyway  naw i think ill strand us all here for at best a stretched moral argument
1471,startrek,they never say exactly what pah is she didnt say that sisko and she will meet again
1472,startrek,there are a lot of people who are convinced that the only people who like discovery are new fans  i started watching trek a decade ago and watched all of tng ds9 and voyager before new trek but *i like new trek*
1473,startrek,so the things other people have mentioned but also its possible that dilithium is necessary to -create- the singularities in the singularity drives  maybe its an electric car battery situation  an electric car doesnt use fossil fuels but fossil fuels are still necessary to create the car  its also possible the romulans had drifted away from singularity drives after the supernova  maybe singularity drives are difficult to produce under their later circumstances or maybe advances in warp technology prompted them to switch  there are a looooot of possible explanations
1474,startrek,i fookin’ *loved* the last two seasons of enterprise barring that insulting final episode &amp; agree with your assessment safe to say i’m enjoying discovery as well with some minor complaints having recently rewatched enterprise it really was heartbreaking to see the show really break into its stride during the last season then abruptly end on a stinker i mean at least terra prime was a good enough finale if you want to think of it that way but still definitely hope discovery gets more of a heads up if it doesn’t make it to seven seasons
1475,startrek,&gt; i think most of trek fans problems with discovery are that it is really close to getting it right but it seems stuck in the uncanny valley of trekdom it is so close to being a great show that it’s faults really stick outi think this is true of every new trek show when tng first came out a lot of fans really hated on it same with ds9 voyager and enterprise after it every show tries to be star trek while also being new star trek and its the new part that sometimes trips fans upive been a trek fan for most of my life im 36 and i grew up on tng ds9 and voyager i give all of these new shows the same benefit of the doubt that i would expect old-school tos fans to have given tng ds9 and voyager most of them didnt hell i remember even within the last decade having arguments with people about whether ds9 was real star trek since it violated roddenberrys vision or some other similar argumentif i seem to have a short fuse for valid criticism its because its all been said and done before i hate it because its just the same complaints over and over and over and over and over and over again like i get it its a valid complaint but it was just as valid 20 years ago for those other shows and now those shows are sacrosanct the double standard is mind boggling to meall that said i do believe we are in more agreement than disagreement
1476,startrek,hes probably still a lieutenant  they should promote him
1477,startrek,finally some good fucking star trek
1478,startrek,if jeffrey combs is the mysterious federation president people will absolutely lose their minds the thought just occurred to me and while i don’t think he will be he kinda should be and i imagine if he was
1479,startrek,duolingo has klingon
1480,startrek,he hasnt been offered sby more trek roles
1481,startrek,see everything that matters in trek even in its past happens because of michael burnham
1482,startrek,as i’ve explained before the conversations with clancy play into the “bitch admiral” trope originally of alynna nechayev infamy which is a rhetorical instance of *picard*’s misogynistic writing much in the same way we know more about picard the character we also have the benefit of sixty years of trek lore coming into this so you agree that other curse words are minor in comparison point being you make no clear distinction for why “fuck” is verboten but not goddamn or shit even though those two aren’t permitted on broadcast tv either the n word reference is just an in bad faith red herring uh emotions are imperfect and cause people to “malfunction” have you ever experienced crippling depression or anxiety you can’t fucking move have you ever been so overwhelmed with emotion that all you can say is “oh shit” i have i’m not sure why you’re staking this apparent position that emotions are somehow inherently mechanistic sure the chip itself literally malfunctioned but it’s pretty clearly an allegory for the potentially overwhelming effect of emotion
1483,startrek,neelix did have some good episodes  i love how he annoyed tuvok  hes a pretty sad character actually  his whole family was wiped out by a nuke
1484,startrek,it felt like the writers completely forget that samantha wildman was still alive
1485,startrek,didnt kirk get some on christmas day
1486,startrek,its my least favourite trek by far
1487,startrek,i want shran to pop up ***make it happen pink skins***
1488,startrek,i live it too thanks for reminding me so often i check into reddit and all i see is people hating trek on trek subs i assumed that’s all there waslove the diverse representation and the emotional beats mimic the cheese of the original series and i love the connection to spock himself it’s been fantastic
1489,startrek,2 episodes wouldve been fine if they were in universe they went from 2 mirror episodes to 2 holodeck episodes all in a row basically the writers saying we dont want to be constrained by literally any actual star trek lore or canon lets just use the filler episode plot devices from all of trek before then nothing we do matters
1490,startrek,irrelevant to the discussion about the best admirals anyway
1491,startrek,i cant watch it the bad writing stupid dialogue along with obvious attempts to be woke every 5 seconds plus total disregard or complete butchery of canon i just cant do it i will just be in a bad mood lol it’s almost like kurtzman never worked on trek at all or he was like the lazy kid in class who over heard what was going on a little but not really understanding cause he just didn’t care just frustrating and the trek vibe isn’t there
1492,startrek, if 70000 light years would take a 70 years to reach home most ships can travel 1000 to 1500 light years depended how long the can hold warp 8so most ships can travel 2 to 3 light years a dayif it takes 3 months the federation is only 250 light yearthe federation seems much smaller then i thought
1493,startrek,&gt;the first 2 seasons and arguably the 3rd season of tng were not much good eitherone of the reasons i give dsc a lot of slack is its episode count tng had 52+ episodes to get good dsc has to struggle with making a new engaging serialized format and its gonna end s3 with less than 40 episodes
1494,startrek,so i had some trouble watching ent through i took a break after the xindi plot which i really liked was done not sure why but i agree that the upcoming or ongoing plot about the foundation of the federation had a lot of potential
1495,startrek,she was also a collaborator
1496,startrek,i think we are in agreement so i don’t want it to seem like an argument ds9 is proof that serialized star trek can be more than good i think most of trek fans problems with discovery are that it is really close to getting it right but it seems stuck in the uncanny valley of trekdom it is so close to being a great show that it’s faults really stick out of course truthfully as many problems i have with discovery i enjoy it enough that i will watch it through it’s run there isn’t another space sci-fi show currently airing that i’d rather watch if your first thought is mandelorian i consider that space fantasy like all star warsi think the writers are stuck in the mindset of writing a trek show when they need to be writing a good serialized show which means fleshing out the secondary characters without it being because they have written every picard and data sisko/odo janeway/seven-of-nine etc that has come to mindi have hope that picard season 2 will improve as hopefully they have gotten most of the fan service out of the way
1497,startrek,it is an excellent list gave you a shoutout on mine here: 
1498,startrek,discovery and indeed most of modern trek is like having your favourite meal prepared in a different way personally i love it its my favourite but new and different but i can see how others would be put off even if it frustrates me by how vocal they are about how put off they are
1499,startrek,you the one who is moving now i got this game as a birthday present and i remember trying to get my non-trek friends and cousins to play it with me with varying levels of enthusiasm i think i remember robert oreillys scenery chewing klingon villain the most though the guy was like gowron dialled up to 11i do wish i hadnt given it to goodwill in the mid 2000s
1500,startrek,ive got to make the joke but have you seen the high ranking members of starfleet theyve never really been good at their job even as far back as tos except maybe a couple in tng and voyager are ok lol
1501,startrek,large organizations of any kind need structure
1502,startrek,calling it now detmer  because they made the point of dealing with her ptsd this season
1503,startrek,youve repeatedly said now that season 3 of tng is arguably bad but you have not provided any evidence to support that claim that i have seen as far as discovery season 3 goes like season 2 it starts strong but as we get farther along cracks are showing: tilly being made acting first officer michael not learning anything since episode 1 season 1 and continuing to be insubordinate eye waterworks all the time
1504,startrek,its also on startrekcom though can sometimes be hard to find
1505,startrek,mariner is laughing from beyond the grave
1506,startrek,star fleet “acquiring” romulan ale from illegitimate sources shows they have always accepted capitalism to some degree
1507,startrek,what i really like about disco is how different each season is
1508,startrek,i might be wrong but romulans always reminded me of imperial japan
1509,startrek,s03e04 who watches the watchers is my all time favourite the one where an anthropological team gets spotted by the rational bronze age society theyre observing and accidentally starts a religion its s wonderful reversal of the magical thinking in our own society and how picard undoes the knot shows his character and dedication with brilliance its a delight
1510,startrek,imagine thinking the criticisms of discovery that are already out there were “invalid” lmao good post though
1511,startrek,fine ill delete the post
1512,startrek,isnt star trek about change though every show has been different from the ones that came before often with cries of this isnt star trek lol to me the orville just seems like tng with some extra humor slapped on it if thats what people want then ok but copy-paste has never been star treks thing except for maybe the animated shows
1513,startrek,i love the hell out of it
1514,startrek,neelix is what happens when a 90s nickelodeon cartoon is struck by lightning and becomes sentient
1515,startrek,&gt; to remind him the dangers of getting to emotional and letting it affect his choiceswhat dangers she gets emotional does whatever the hell she wants and everything works out in the end
1516,startrek,yet a ceasefire would allow those ideals to thrive  cutting the nose to spite the face
1517,startrek,ds9 is definitely one of my favourites im enjoying disco right now and i want to se the full 7 seasons before i judge on its place in the pantheon i believe enterprise could have done extremely well if it had been given a full 7 seasons
1518,startrek,my problem with discovery is that every scene wants to be heavy dramatic and emotional and when every scene is like that none of it sticks nothing stands out as a breakthrough or important it all kinda just falls flat so you dont connect of feel any real genuine concern for the chracters
1519,startrek,i bet he was lwaxanas last husband she died 20 years ago but he still grieves her as if she died yesterday
1520,startrek,dont you hate on m ent its no 1 in my book and we dont speak of that atrocious final ep
1521,startrek,she knows everything about everything and more than her specialists on board
1522,startrek,ooooh i really enjoyed watching season 1 againhavent done it with season 2im looking forward to strange new worlds
1523,startrek,thank you its so nice to see someone else who get annoyed by janeway and one of my best friends chose to name herself after her
1524,startrek,also married to her i assume
1525,startrek,i didnt say it made an episode bad i actually like yesterdays enterprise i just pointed out he didnt understand itif youll pardon me ill not take this tangentthe proposal is that star trek discovery is good
1526,startrek,i dislike the star trek you like so obviously the star trek you like is non-star trek drivel /s
1527,startrek,the main criticisms are fixable though but the show runner and writers don’t care to give us character development and stop with burnham being the only one that can ever fix things when shit gets serious the last two seasons have started that way and about halfway through it turns back into star trek: burnham
1528,startrek,they needed to give georgiou the two episodes to set up that terrible section 31 show that no one wants
1529,startrek,he pirated a ship of their means to get home setting them back years because he needed their equipment
1530,startrek,ive personally been really enjoying s3 but thats an interesting point you make about tng/ds9s episodes each adding something to the universe i feel like its because those shows and even voy/ent had a lot of episodes that werent high stakes and was mostly just the characters hanging out in the holodeck or going on a low key away mission and we get to see how they interact with each other when theres not a threat to all civilization involved to me those little things add more to the universe than the new big bad of the season
1531,startrek,they are ridiculous and do not understand the classic definition of that term
1532,startrek,he’s doing a subspace radio show that goes over things like wolf 359 being an inside job and the dominion war not being real
1533,startrek,i think discovery is the next on my watchlistim rewatching ds9 right now and i really like the setting and the development of the plot i even think it could be my favourite startrek so farthe concept of voyager was really cool but i had the problem that the plot started to repeat itself and the ending was just bad i had no real problem with janewayeven picard has potential i think the first season had some downsides but im really looking forward to the next one hoping to see some exploring
1534,startrek,awesome i hope you enjoy it
1535,startrek,also vic fontaine for helping nog out the way he did
1536,startrek,ill say haha welp looks like shes not gonna get red-shirted at least lol oh no random brunette weve never seen before and dont know your name - she got blasted in the face whatever shall we do what a loss
1537,startrek,discovery and picards first season lacked sub-plots mostly because they were so focused on establishing new characters there wasnt a ton of room for sub-plotsdiscovery season 2 and season 3 have had various sub-plots within episodes that sometimes culminate in an episodes a-plot i suspect picard season 2 will be doing more of the same now that most of the characters are well established
1538,startrek,tilly being on a command path was absolutely not a joke if you thought that thats on you now the speed at which they went about it is open to criticism but her career path was never meant to be played for laughs
1539,startrek,it’s free on yt with commercials or on cbsaa worth it for some behind the scenes info interviews and an extra preview of the next week usually released 24hrs after the current ep airs
1540,startrek,surprised nobody has mentioned this yet and to preface i havent see the latest episode but the one prior was total ass it was worse than a bad moffat episode from doctor who which is tolerable because doctor who has a different universe and standard than st but this is st nobody going to mention the random kelpian with magical powers that somehow can simultaneously detonate all fucking active dilithium in the universe what kind of shit story telling is that q could sure but their explanation was well uhh he grew up near a lot of dilithium so uhh yeah im gonna watch the latest episode now after posting this but i find it to be just more trash being written my thoughts were uhh thats it that was the origin of the fucking burn lamest shit since kelvin universe beastie boys music weapon thing
1541,startrek,&gt;cant wait to see what this untitled trek show is all aboutits a section 31 show staring ash tyler and georgiou likely set in the 23rd century after discovery s2 given ash is in it officially it doesnt have a title and is just untitled section 31 showi think they should just call it star trek: section 31 and save us some time
1542,startrek,the actions of the commanding officer of a major starport are irrelevant okay
1543,startrek,i agree even if it was possible in today’s environment to go back to 27 episode seasons i think deep down we all realize that would not be a good thingi’m hoping strange new worlds or one of the other treks in the production pipeline is centered on more episodic content because it would offer something different than every other sci-fi show that all have one overarching story i think one of the issues with discovery and picard is that unless they are better or at least at the same level than bsg or b5 they feel like generic sci-fi with a thin coating of star trek
1544,startrek,weaker physically but when it comes to the operating a starship side if things they dominate starfleet and clearly make the best captains
1545,startrek,leaving this as a separate comment but i believe serialized story telling can have a place in star trek and add value to the franchisea big case-in-point is the season 3 sub-plot with georgiou she starts having health issues relatively early in the season that develops as the season progresses until we get a two-parter where she returns to the mirror universe some months before she originally left we get to see a contrast in her character in that shes changed since coming to the prime universe despite her protestations to the contrary it also sets up her return to the prime universes past probably 22nd century that she left from but we have to wait and see ds9 had a number of episodes that could have benefitted from this kind of story telling like chief obrien getting a 40 year prison sentence carried out virtually in 5 minutes that episode takes place over many months but it doesnt feel like it because the story is self contained imagine spreading his recovery over 3-5 episodes or more instead of dealing with it all in a self-contained episode never to be discussed again we get to see his ptsd from the experience manifest as a sub-plot over the course of a season maybe culminating in an episode where it becomes the a-plot
1546,startrek,&gt; its not star trekthis has been said about every show since tng lol tng wasnt star trek because kirk spock and mccoy werent in it ds9 wasnt star trek because it was on a space station and had gritty plot lines about war and politics voyager wasnt star trek because it wasnt about a ship named enterprise and was in a different quadrant enterprise wasnt star trek and was revisionist because the vulcans acted weird the reboot movies werent star trek because they were too action-y&gt; i just hate that the show is centered around her and that the plot is written around thatthis isnt really anything new lol tos was centered around kirk spock and mccoy but primarily kirk remember all the times kirk saved the galaxy in the nick of time burnhams got nothing on kirks stats lol remember the reboot movies they were so centered around kirk he was promoted from cadet to captain so he could save the galaxy from the romulans looking for him lol
1547,startrek,i really enjoy it too i’ve been looking forward to new episodes all season and this season especially has been so strong to me i’ve loved having appointment watching for star trek back in my life feels like i’m a kid again waiting for new tng episodes i do wish i could watch it with my kid but she can watch it when she’s older
1548,startrek,&gt; its still a dumb name theres lots of awesome female guitarists who can play that way and its a weird epithet to apply to them yes it is hardly rarity on reddit and i don’t know why you turned this into a gender issue my name isn’t in praise of cock rock/hair metal and i wouldn’t put led zep in there anyhow i’m thinking more mötley crüe warrant or poison some make up big hair and some big time arrogance/ego as well as chauvinistic lyrics some of them like guns n roses i can’t even listen to anymore because of lyrics there are many great female guitarists and only a few i would put in that category but this has nothing to do with this post
1549,startrek,ahem baltar he deserved death prick let the cylons in
1550,startrek,yeah but he isnt an admiral so his actions are irrelevant
1551,startrek,jetrel was the best episode of s1 and i quite liked mortal coil as well   also i just finished demon and i liked his little mini-arc about sleeping in sickbay as soon as there were patients not only did he get up and go he got everyone else out immediately   i do wish neelix wouldve been more overprotective father figure than romance with kes but we got what we got
1552,startrek,no worse than what sisko did in in the pale moonlight imo
1553,startrek,yes but theres a good reason for all of those because the captain makes the final say for important decisions and is the person at the top of the ladder theres almost always a good reason why theyre involved in important events burnham is effectively just a normal person on the ship she doesnt take part in most of the important decisions most of the time
1554,startrek,don’t get me wrong i like disco but i went back to watch season 1 and 2 before season 3 came out and i stumbled through 1 i don’t know if it was just too soon or if i really didn’t like it based on rewatch it was all over the place im just glad it seems like s3 really fell into it’s groove i’m now really excited to see where it goes
1555,startrek,unfortunately so much of ds9s worldbuilding starts in s2 in s1 rom is too dumb to be accused of things quark cracks into his own replicator to fix it its all super impressive still
1556,startrek,25th anniversary was pretty good  i heard a final unity was just as good for tng  i think there was a ds9 one too
1557,startrek,&gt;discovery was a must watch on the night it comes out show for me despite its flaws but now its a oh new episode ill get around to it sometimethis hurts and is true for me as well
1558,startrek,wheelchair scientist gave me vibes of haley joel osment in future man
1559,startrek,i believe it was mentioned in *first contact* that the federation spans 8000 light years
1560,startrek,do the writers even watch their own material rom was whatever they needed him to be how else does rom the idiot become rom savior of the alpha quadrant /s
1561,startrek,oh thats odd i scored it 3/10 on my 2020 re-watch with friends spreadsheetmaybe ill go and take another look
1562,startrek,the fan made animated miniseries where tos crew go to a tropical islander-themed colony was pretty awesome i recommend this as well as some of the other fan-made animated projects they are low key but very faithful to the good things of trek
1563,startrek,people like the one youre replying to just think groups exist to endlessly fellate everything about the show and criticism in any form is an evil that should be banished
1564,startrek,stamets or bryce or someone *really* quickly in the last episode said something like nilssons trying to get shields/engines back online in engineering so presumably she got taken off the ship with everyone else as not a bridge officer wrong place wrong time
1565,startrek,i think youve cracked it tng / ds9 not every episode is very good but it feels like each episode matters and adds something to the universe  with disc i just dont care all the emotional cues are there endless hugging and crying and speeches about friendship and music but i just dont care it hasnt earned it
1566,startrek,whats absolutely mind boggling to me is that those shouldnt even be close to tough ones theyre the freaking bridge crew
1567,startrek,&gt;also thought it was obvious shes spoofing the biometrics especially since she pretended to be unfamiliar with itagreed particularly coupled with how nervous she was beforehand several of her comments about the generic white human model made me think of a joke in eureka where sheriff carter asks why the cpr dummies look like him and hes told they are generic and made me smile
1568,startrek,spoiler policy from the subreddit sidebar:&gt;we ask that you utilize the spoiler system for any and all spoilers relating to recently released episodes/movies ie **released within the last month** posts which have spoilers in the title will be  posts containing spoilers will be marked as spoilers by the mod team if youre not sure if your post contains a spoiler tag it as one anyway just in caseemphasis mine
1569,startrek,led zep was my favourite growing up its still a dumb name theres lots of awesome female guitarists who can play that way and its a weird epithet to apply to them
1570,startrek,it took… great effort effort… to bring you …here
1571,startrek,i watched seasons 1 and 2 of discovery and all of enterprise around the same time i made this exact observation
1572,startrek,💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
1573,startrek,nice i guess you judged neelix quickly so judge away also it’s a genre of music you know that right
1574,startrek,100% agreed but if someone with 10 months experience was promoted to head departments even if everyone was ok with it which many would not be it would create all kinds of confusion about who to look to in an emergency
1575,startrek,yeah i get how a person with your username is the height of maturity
1576,startrek,that’s fine sounds like you haven’t grown out of it also what does it have to do with naomi that’s just slander ffs
1577,startrek,yeah i found his behavior gross and i dont feel he ever grew out of it i was glad she left him
1578,startrek,i like the fact that they forshadowed his genius early in the show with bits about him breaking into quarks safe and locks and him keeping the holosuites running  i am watching them all back to back now and it is amazing how i can see it coming
1579,startrek,because benamite is also scarce
1580,startrek,and from what i saw in season 1 they did the same thing with the characters
1581,startrek,humans seem to be one of the weaker races especially when you consider we dont see any ships independent of starfleetandorians probably is the correct answer with vulcans being 2nd
1582,startrek,crystalline entity
1583,startrek,yeah you just cant beat his wonderful personality
1584,startrek,what is this kind of bullshit take she was a grown woman their race was different i admit it was clumsy as fuck but it’s not like she was naomi &gt;  he was in a ~~creepy~~ possessive ~~controlling~~ relationship with herhardly a flaw everyone struggles with this i don’t get this projection people put on a fucking character he was worried someone would steal his love he grew and got over it he wasn’t controlling show me where he stopped her doing something  the paris/neelix eps were good and tell me that shit doesn’t happen in every fucking tv show
1585,startrek,kes was a child in human years she was almost middle aged in ocampa years when she left the shipyes he was jealous and mildly controlling but kes hardly appears emotionally or intellectually child-like at any point in the show she’s certainly a character that challenges the perspective of the crew and audience i compare it to the perspective of an older vulcan compared to a human in their 20s or 30s
1586,startrek,oh right i didnt realse :
1587,startrek,less crying less whisper talking more vance and grudgeno stupid illogical promotions to xo
1588,startrek,nuff said
1589,startrek,even in a flat structured organization like google which isnt *that* flat someone with 10 months of experience at junior position wouldnt be asked to head a department let alone head of all departments
1590,startrek,my theory is it’s someone vance was close to boyfriend/husband/kid ect that died to osyrra one way or the other maybe this person lived or worked at an exchange given vance’s line that there were good people in the chain he was using it in some way to try and goad her or see if she even recognized it
1591,startrek,they keep carrying on about dilithium meanwhile books ship is flying around with quantum slipstream in voyager we also saw a ship with quantum slipstream that didnt even use anti-matterwhy do they even care about dilithium build quantum slipstream ships instead
1592,startrek,star wars actually hasnt been getting that many games lately compared to how many it used to getbut anyway they need to make another bridge commander that game was great
1593,startrek,based and kidney-pilled
1594,startrek,she left two episodes ago  how is that spoilers
1595,startrek,naw they just would have shifted the narrative to make saru look even worse
1596,startrek,affirmative action lol
1597,startrek,yeah wheres nilsson
1598,startrek,its been confirmed that hes returning in season 4
1599,startrek,no respect
1600,startrek,well its definitely *like* star trek except it takes ten times as long to tell a story the technology is now complete magic and doesnt need to make any sense and everyone cries all the goddamned time#star trek: discovering crying
1601,startrek,that creeped me out because did we all forget that kes was a child in ocampa years and he was in a creepy possessive controlling relationship with her
1602,startrek,which hurts star trek i love rewatching the old treks because of the filler episodes as great as “best of both worlds” or the dominion war are i rewatch episodes like “the drumhead” “the visitor” or “far beyond the stars” much more theme of the week episodes work really well in star trek because it adds to the theme of exploration by fleshing out and emphasizing the size of the universe when confined to a season long arc it limits the size of that universe confining our characters to one eventi hope in the many shows lined up that there is one that is a story of the week type that seems like a potential solution to me you have your discoveries and picards hopefully they figure out a better way to flesh out secondary characters too since as a commenter pointed out that the best modern shows find a way to flesh out their secondary characters with less episodes that are overarching stories but hopefully there is a show in development that can fill the theme of the week itch in longtime trekkies
1603,startrek,stormfront burnham
1604,startrek,we know that dilithium can be used to regulate matter anti-matter reactions used in most races warp drives we dont know thats the only thing dilithium can do or that the romulans singularity based warp drives dont also need dilithium perhaps dilithium is used in them as well its never been stated that they dont
1605,startrek,look i get it but he also tucks naomi in and thats friggin cute
1606,startrek,my goodness youre right theyre really getting close to that stage where they could have 1 episode of trek per week for a year cant wait to see what this untitled trek show is all about i remember alex kurtzman teasing two of them earlier in the year with one of them being snw sure hope theyve got an announcement plan in the works
1607,startrek,sounds like hes on the spectrum
1608,startrek,part of the reason the ranks are necessary in a military environment so everyone understands the chain of command without hesitation so that in a moment where second matter no one has to question who to look to a flat structure like some companies such as google like to promote only works because seconds dont matter and no ones life is every on the line
1609,startrek,how the hell would michael on the bridge when her son is being born in sickbay
1610,startrek,is remember me not well received its one of my favorite episodes :/
1611,startrek,- how is it misogyny what evidence do you have that picard was in any way influenced by her being a woman- if all bad words are equivalent then say the n word- data saying shit was a comical instance of his chip malfunctioning  its a poor example of what humanity is supposed to be in trek once he got it under control its not like he turned into a quentin tarantino character to show him embracing his humanity or anything
1612,startrek,spoilers
1613,startrek,judge aaron satie would approve of this statement
1614,startrek,&gt; he can be annoying can
1615,startrek,whats are the bad episodes in season 3 of tng  an actor/director not understanding an episode on a podcast does not make an episode bad given that its one of the most popular episodes most of the fans apparently understand it enough to like it edit: you need many more than one bad episode to make a season of tv bad i think most would argue that the majority of episode in season 3 are good
1616,startrek,there is no federation president or it’s actually vance
1617,startrek,lots of people here would argue its fitting to the show as welli personally really like s3 for the most part
1618,startrek,lets look at this from the hollywood point of view here soniqua martin-green is the star of the show the show is about her character because she is the first person named in the credits for every show all of the other characters are played by supporting actors if discoverys actors were ever to be nominated for emmy awards soniqua would be in the best actress category and doug jones would be in the best supporting actor category or something along those lines this would be true for any of the captains weve already watched in every series star trek has aired the only difference is that michael is not a captain which was baked into discovery since the very beginning you may not find it interesting or fun but discovery absolutely is star trek its in the title which was also baked in from the very beginning
1619,startrek,no it was her job title and we see her do it maybe three times in the whole series and i dont think ever explicitly after the 3-parter that opens the second seasonthere are plots throughout the show where she is trying to obtain records or speak to important people on bajor and its always presented as something she has to do outside of official channels because its more dramatic/interesting when it should be easy for her shell occasionally make reference to my contacts on bajor as if its more about her personal or backdoor relationships rather than her position as a person whose professional connections are part of her jobin later seasons she has a romantic relationship with the first minister and no one mentions that it might be a conflict of interest considering that we know her post is a political appointment of the provisional government is it remains provisional throughout the series annoyingly because the show dropped *most* of the bajoran political stuff when micheal piller leftokay though i do get where youre coming from fair enough its the weakest of my examples my only point was that its very silly to complain about the duties of tilly in the role of first officer as if any of the trek shows ever had more than the slightest regard for how any of these roles are supposed to *actually* work
1620,startrek,i like culber however i agree about stamets his delivery is just kind of odd i like him in scenes with jett since both characters play off each other well but with anyone else he just seems too awkward in a way that doesnt work for me
1621,startrek,she’s also a liar she’s not exactly reliable
1622,startrek,i havent watched s3this for real
1623,startrek,doing the chronological watch of the entire franchise and i saw this episode yesterday my favorite rom line has to be mooooooogiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeee
1624,startrek,not even the entire show this was done in the first episode or two
1625,startrek,of course and then she does one of her ~~canned~~ inspirational speeches and the remainder of the chain joins the federation
1626,startrek,i have a feeling the most “federation” captain wouldn’t break the prime directive when it felt “necessary”the most federation captain is probably archer since he was down with genocide if it meant not interfering with whatever civilization he was interfering with
1627,startrek,your understanding of romulan tech is what 700 years out of date and they’re not even romulans any more they’re ni’varians
1628,startrek,eli: hes telling the truthgarak: *especially* when im lying admiral
1629,startrek,my dogs name is riker
1630,startrek,they could have consulted anyone vaguely familiar with star trek universe
1631,startrek,nah i agree despite the incredibly challenging situations she found herself in she did her best to adhere to federation principles and only broke them when she thought she had no choice it’s one of the things i really like about janeway
1632,startrek,accepting a peace that requires you to condone crimes against sapience like that are a faustian bargain
1633,startrek,classic moment from breaking bad comes to mind
1634,startrek,the critics see themselves in neelix
1635,startrek,something thats different now is syndication old trek was written so thst almost each episode is self contained at the end everything is back to status que discovery was written to be serialized not condemning nor condoning just saying it was written differently however thst doesnt excuse disco from never actually being trek  new eden is the only episode i can think of thats trek like the rest just isnt
1636,startrek,because its obviously a ruse and a lie she never had any intention of following through with it  shes giving him something he wants to believe is real thats allhe called her bluff masterfully by putting in a poison pill so he could scuttle it without being forced to act in overt bad faith
1637,startrek,yeah the trill episode was the giant eye rollerculber: hey burnham you should go instead because youre more equipped to deal with adiratrill guy: hey burnham jump in the pool and help adira through this complex joining process
1638,startrek,sisko believed in getting his hands dirty to save his people and the ideas of the federation one of the main tenets of the federation is its anti-capitalism and its socialism and so sisko would not have taken that deal he would have rejected that deal out right the second she was talking about recognizing capitalism as a valid system
1639,startrek,i have been lurking here for a while now checking in every now and then i gave dis twice a chance to impress me but they didnt really do that picard though has killed my passion of startrek me i dont really care anymore which is somewhat sad as being the trekkie has defined me for quite many years so i skipped s3 because i feared what you describe that the show would focus on burnham to me she is an inherently unlikable character quick to emotional outbursts despite being raised by vulcans violent and emotionally highly unstablethe creators of the show are talented no question about it the actors are amazing makeup is amazing and the cgi is well and truly top notch for a tv show so the writing has to be completely terrible to sink this one and whoopdy doo it is the writers and showrunners give the extremely strong impression that they would actually like to do something else that startrek isnt their thing they know its about federationy and sciency thingies and while having all the information about it they lack the soul and passion and go out of their way to not be startrektheir trip to the year 3000 is proof of that they dont really want to do startrek if they did they would focus on the neutral zone the romulans and so forth its that timeperiod and there is a whole lot of startrek waiting to be told from a lack of passion carelessness is born and thus weak scripts season 2s villain control alone is an example of how utterly inept the writers are it displays a level of willful ignorance to the topic a super advanced ai that can just be explained with season2 meh whatever timetravel and evil robot sound good so we can get away from lore and tell the stories we actually want to tellso thats why i avoided s3 i had no indication that it would get better so get this in 2020 the year of no entertainment and general dreadfulness me as a scifi hound skips freaking startrek thats not nothing at least not to mewith the current clique that is in charge of the creative direction i dont really see myself coming back at any point
1640,startrek,oh my god if you dont like it dont watch it and just move on what *you* want does not matter at all you have no right whatsoever to demand anything
1641,startrek,i get a wicked witch of the west vibe from osyrra
1642,startrek,not moff gideon though sadly
1643,startrek,yes i was just waiting for her to have to walk through broken glass in her bare feet
1644,startrek,imo new eden is the only episode to date that has felt like star trek  trek has always been about ethics and choices it gives the ability to thr viewer to ask questions and give points of view without talking about things that separate people trek allows standins on social political and religious views views on technology discovery as a whole hasnt been about any of that there is no discovery or wonder in the show called discovery   take the little trek out of the show and you have a poorly written mess scifi as a whole is just a location  tell me a story dont keep me waiting to tell a story then just drop it last second this season a build up of what is the burn was such a let down  how can i care about a crew i dont know i can only tell you 3 names on the show the rest i have to look up thats horrible writing the ability to not name characters on the show or even care about them  what is the premise of the show  i can list everything on the other shows  this one doesnt have one  i think im just going to stop watching because i just dont care anymore
1645,startrek,seven was a fantastic addition to the show in my top 5 all-time trek characters for sure her journey is worth watching the entire show for she has some wonderful moments with the doctor too
1646,startrek,please state the nature of the political crisis
1647,startrek,it reminds me a lot of the issues between law &amp; order and l&amp;o: svu aka l&amp;o: the olivia benson show the original law &amp; order you know who all the main characters are they get equal amounts of airtime though the focus remains on the case the characters have quirks and real personalities that you know and though the cast changes fairly regularly the losses are felt you miss people when they’re gonel&amp;o: svu is about nothing and no one except a day in the life of olivia benson though this was not always the case it started off being more ensemble-focused everything has to revolve around her nobody else is allowed a storyline a life or to save the day who are the other characters what are they like sure they exist but they’re poorly written underwritten and if they leave you don’t really care because the show never wanted you to pay attention to them but benson’s not interesting was she ever really anyone’s favourite character no but everything and everyone else is tossed aside in favour of her if there’s a villain it’s her personal villain all tragedies must involve herit’s fine if that’s the show but that’s not law &amp; order and shouldn’t be marketed as suchthat’s how i see discovery and why i don’t watch it anymore
1648,startrek,i predict that your predictions for the finale are spot-on id like to add that there will also be at least three scenes of michael crying
1649,startrek,yeah the appearance is just for comfort eli seeing or not the face doesnt make a difference
1650,startrek,i always say just try to do it in order if you really cant then a the show probably isnt for you and b then do a hilights real to get you hooked or jump to a latter series
1651,startrek,she’s probably making up for lost time i agree though i’m tired of all the emotional moments every episode dragged out and put in at inappropriate times it’s draining and cheapens the effect it should have i liked the last episode but there are still too many overly dramatic moments such as where she and book crash in to the ship then are rushing to get ready before security turns up but do have time for an emotional goodbye speech from both then a passionate kiss i might forgive it or accept it but it happens almost every episode so i find it wears on my patience
1652,startrek,marx lol the apples were made out of the same thing that was
1653,startrek,that may account for him taking over 15 years to attain the rank of lieutenant commander when others seemed to rise through the ranks much quicker
1654,startrek,my main problem with osyraa is that her face doesnt move due to the prosthetics even odo had more facial expressions than her its very uncanny valley which isnt a good thing
1655,startrek,&gt;with cbs all access doing a few series with 10-13 episodes a year they might have to compensate with more seriestime to make your day :there are 55 weeks in a year cbs currently has these series in production: discovery picard lower decks prodigy strange new world and untitled section 31 showeven if every season has 10 episodes and discovery has always had more so far thats 60 weeks for a streaming service one trek after another makes sense to keep people subscribed and while i dont think it was ever confirmed it appears that was the plan starting with discovery s3 after picard but then covid happened and discovery got delayed while lower decks got bumped uphowever every one of those shows has a 2021 release date and will be filming if it isnt already by febuary except s31 which to me knowledge has no release or production dates yet implying itll be the last show released
1656,startrek,and oddly low tech considering tng did it with force fields
1657,startrek,hmm paris and kim are damp squids not worth the attention how many times did they try to force kim-centric episodes early on before realising the audience couldn’t care less thank god the writers gave up on him and paris don’t even get me started on the awfully forced relationship paris ends up in and how on earth could you drop the borg from voyager without them without the eventual addition of seven and even icheb the show would be much lesser for it
1658,startrek,if i didn’t know any better i’d believe a bunch of hardcore trekkies were misogynistic ¯\ツ/¯
1659,startrek,the real problem imo is that season is literally half as long while costing twice as much the sad reality is that you can’t produce fillers anymore because there isn’t time lower decks tried but even that felt rushed and frenetic compounded by episodes also being half as long shows also can’t have duds like they used to see: enterprisefwiw i remember similar critiques of ds9 especially in seasons 6 and 7 but also complaining when we spent time in s7 exploring ezri ds9 s7 is an interesting study the final arc was 10 episodes long that’s basically a discovery season by itself add to that the setup in the first three episodes and that’s it there were a lot of standout stories in s7 take me out to the holosuite siege of ar-558it’s only a paper moon inter arma and some fun ones like bada bing there isn’t really room for those kinds of stories and serialized storytelling which seems to be necessary now ironically su’kals story which is pretty traditionally trek feels out of place in discovery because of the slower pacing the issue of the bridge crew i can forgive to some extent - sulu uhura chekov et al really didn’t get much development before the movies mayweather was tragically underused troi and crusher together always very failed bechdel i’m not sure how much of this is discovery versus star trek clashing with what tv demands now a good comparison is voyager tng rode on roddenberrys coattails and ds9 was syndicated so the producers got left alone voyager has always bothered me because it felt like a wasted opportunity there weren’t stories where their isolation was really explored and they never struggled for resources you could feel the upn execs dictating what the show needed to be and not good storytelling that delivered on a really strong premise
1660,startrek,i believe we learned in a tng episode that their ships are powered by a singularity rather than dilithiun that one where picard and the gang found themselves stuck in a temporal bubble and were attempting to prevent their ship from overloading
1661,startrek,arent we all
1662,startrek,and why cant they just take a small asteroid and use that matter instead
1663,startrek,as the spiritual leader who confers with the prophets more regularly i would feel safe in assuming she knew what she was talking about she could have been wrong but she identified the emassary at the drop of a hat i feel like her spiritual sensitivity can make her confidently say that plot hole may not have been the best word i didnt want to spend too much time on the title *shrug*
1664,startrek,you raise a good point  we were told it would be burnham-focusedthat said i assumed it would be burnham-focused to the same extent that tng is picard-focused  there would be room for several other characters to be developedi guess the issue though is that picard can decide on a course of action and several crew members can implement it  how can we have a burnham-centred episode where saru makes a plan and rhys/bryce and nilsson work together to solve iti think that either they should have centred the story on a captain from the start had burnham lead a significant team as a science officer or promoted burnham to captain by season 3
1665,startrek,i meant picard appearing the least in tng i may be making that up though
1666,startrek,citation needed but i think that might actually be true for their entire sto line of shipsthe code is only valid for one character one time but still
1667,startrek,one of the best things about rom is his love for his son nog even threatening to burn down the bar he wants so much if quarks messes with nog’s &gt;starfleet entrance exam&lt;
1668,startrek,ferengi isnt a federation race
1669,startrek,but forced profanity1 picard is god how dare she not recognize his genius;
1670,startrek,rom is the legitimate mvp of the dominion war
1671,startrek,i’m still giving it a chance because let’s face it none of the other star trek series started out good with the exception of lower decks at least that’s my opinionhaving shit first second and third seasons is a rite of passage for trek shows honestly
1672,startrek,want some lulz watch tos in hd when kirk fights its crazy obvious that its not william shatner in anything but a close-up
1673,startrek,enterprise feels a lot like ds9s first 4 seasons when you consider a war would have broken out in season 5 the comparison gets even more strikingto me canceling enterprise is equivalent to canceling ds9 at season 4 everyone would say ds9 is pretty good at the end and might have been great with absolutely no idea of the perfection they missed in seasons 5-7of course hypothetically it could have been a massive flop but with the new producer they got for season 4 i dont think so
1674,startrek,
1675,startrek,gender isnt sex  pheromones are 100% biochemistry doesnt really matter what your identity iscf orville and the alien in heated wasnt gay but it still worked on himthe reason they wont bring that back up though is because they think its playing into sexist tropes about femmes fatales
1676,startrek,picard wasnt the main protagonistokay i get it more than in past series micheal is the main character of discovery **get over it people** but even still the number of events centered on her is still fewer than picard had its a *extremely* weak argument against the show especially when discovery *does* elevate its other characters quite a lot it is an ensemble show it really isfor the record im totally fine with all those old storylines for worf and picard even though they strain credulity especially with worf over the years yeesh my point was that if you take the ops criticism at face value *no* other star trek series passes that test and but its not an ensemble show doesnt make it any more logical a position even if i accepted that for the sake of argumentits fine to not like the show some people like oranges but dont like tangerines even though theyre pretty similar those feelings are valid but if you like oranges but not tangerines and try to explain that its because you really dont like the color of tangerines you just come off looking sillylastly ill-concealedly distainful retort oof dude buy a new thesaurus yours is broken
1677,startrek,there’s no information on wether romulans used dilithium or not we know they mined it but that’s about it
1678,startrek,&gt; we as viewers have much more information than she does she only knows that this doddering old fool who left starfleet in a huff 15 years earlier is in her office all but ordering her to giver him a ship just days after he blasted starfleet as no longer being starfleet in a very public interview sheer fucking hubris indeed even his friends warned him that it was a bad ideayes exactly here’s a man 15 years out of starfleet enjoying a leisurely retirement operating a winery who barges into her office in a huff demanding a ship and personnel the only way a viewer could take clancy as the villain in this circumstance is if they’re heavily dosing on tng nostalgia—“bitch admiral” trope and all
1679,startrek,&gt;as to your second specific complaint the federation hadnt tried micheals triangulation technique because they literally had no access to any information with which to test that theory absolutely no means to obtain it and without the first piece of the puzzle no reason to consider it did you not watch the showthis really is quite ridiculous bullshit a presumably galaxy-wide event occurs but nobody thinks about salvaging black boxes from burn-stricken federation vessels until michael burnham shows up 120 or so years later it only took two people and a courier ship to uncover the first piece of the puzzle with the super-outside-of-the-box thinking of using sensor recordings to figure out what happened yes yes of course the federation were just too busy to do some simple recovery and analysis to determine the source of this crippling galaxy-wide event that may or may not happen again even though theres seed ships out there still going on with their assigned missionsyeah dude we watched the show dumb explanations are still dumb explanations
1680,startrek,i mean it is burnham maybe she gets sick pleasure being able hear the panicked breathing of her victims as it gets slower and slower till nothing but silence is left
1681,startrek,right i fear he may be gone now that georgiou is too since he was pretty much an accessory to that plotline
1682,startrek,every episode though
1683,startrek,me too currently on ep 6
1684,startrek,ehto me osyraa is weak and one note and her make up looks badi liked whats his name the frostbite guy way better  he seemed like a more interesting antagonistlike actually competent and not functioning entirely by deus ex and snark
1685,startrek,q is my favorite alien besides spock in star trek and spock is my favorite character of anything of all time i like the fact that instead of being the typical deity q is an old school celestial trickster he loves his omnipotence and immortality but seeks ways to entertain himself and avoid eternal ennui he is fascinated by humanity’s contradictions and at the same time is interested in their potential as such picard represents humanity’s best and q loves the fact that he has enough self-control to resist his temptations q can’t believe that such a young being can be sanctimonious self righteous boring and defiant at the same time in q’s mind picard is his best friend and he trusts him with his life
1686,startrek,to be fair thats not a problem unique to discoveryhowever unless they use their special sr-b or whatever it was called i am going to complain that the federation never called earth again when it is right next to vulcan and andor aka the emerald chain when you think about it
1687,startrek,ok
1688,startrek,yeah i thought that too jumping neutralizes the immediate threat theres no reason not toif shes worried about the ship falling back into regulator hands after they jump just give paul the armband of invisibility and he can hide out in the jeffries tubes
1689,startrek,you see kira interact with the provisional government with regularity in ds9 at least in the first couple sees while they’re still “provisional”  i’m slowly making my way back through the series now and it’s pretty regular when given screen time restrictions i get your overall point but that was a bad example
1690,startrek,wow did i remember that fact wrong :
1691,startrek,that’s not really a plot hole she’s not omnipotent
1692,startrek,whys shouldnt it have a place in trek plenty of characters have cursed before riker has definitely used hell as a curse before and not that long ago that would have been seen as wholey immoral no one has been swearing to insult any one the closest was renos get off my arse which was mearly rude and would have been no less so if she said get of my case
1693,startrek,since all dissenting opinion no matter how mild gets purged from the threads its probably an effort to not get deleted by heavy handed mods
1694,startrek,first picard’s behavior was misogynistic it was also out of line moreover it was unbecoming of a starfleet officer each of these were clearly the points made there all of which underscored the mental intellectual and physical degradation of a man at the end of his life with a defective parietal lobe you also should have expected more from picard as it pertained to how he addressed a senior flag officer the goddamned commander in chief of starfleet i’ll remind again not chide the woman who used a bad word you didn’t like therein lies the implicit misogyny of your argument the implication here is clearly reminiscent of the “bitch admiral” derision so commonly used by trek fans to describe women admirals who say mean things to main characters :second your first and second counterassertions belie your own implicit biases about language coding “mild” and “severe” cursing what kind of heuristic is this what are its generic boundaries what is the metric by which you make this decision can this be applied elsewhere why is “goddamn” not considered a major curse similarly why not “shit” neither of which are welcome on broadcast tv i’d add the point is the heuristic you’re using to qualify what kind of curses are welcome in trek breaks down into meaninglessness with the slightest amount of scrutiny more broadly and not to the specific point of this comment thread this is why i push back so strongly on the “genre-fication” of star trek as this stable thing it’s clearly notthird one of generations’s subplots was clearly data’s evolution as a being and his growing understanding of humanity why are you concerned that i’m rejecting core tenets of trek canon when you’re outright rejecting a major thematic element of one its foundational pieces of lore
1695,startrek,confirmed an episode called unity thank you
1696,startrek,shes one with the prophets my child
1697,startrek,&gt; or b vance agrees to the terms and the chain joins the federationno thats the key this was an alliance not membership membership would have been to far this is comparable to what the klingons and federation had in tng even more so when you consider the klingons still subjugated worlds at the time
1698,startrek,computer one poop removal
1699,startrek,probably not  i see why they got rid of her  it was either that or make her look incompetent
1700,startrek,thats not bad  though id argue that some of those descriptions arent personality traitssome tougher ones  keyla detmer joann owesekun gen rhys ra bryce nilsson
1701,startrek,i love disco season 3 i’ve had a blast watching this show i’m a picardlovers and i do miss some of that solid teamwork with more constructive language and overall disco has me completely hooked and invested looking forward to moar seasons
1702,startrek,you got it thanks for your helpi dont quite understand why the post was downvoted but ill leave it up in case anyone else has this obscure question in the futurethis was one of my favorite borg episodes showing just how powerful and intoxicating the interpersonal borg connection really isthank you again
1703,startrek,only federation members is an interesting rule set kelpiens could curb stomp some people in ground combat they can run at over 80 kph are super strong and have far superior vision to most other federation species we’ve seen *kelpiens possessed visual auditory and tactile receptors more acute than those of humans they had a larger optical window than humans and could see far deeper into the light spectrum than them including in the ultraviolet they could also see heat signatures they could sense predators from as much as ten kilometers*form squads with a mixture of pre-vahar’ai and post- vahar’ai individuals and you’ve got good team composition the threat ganglia kelpiens can serve as scouts and threat detection the shooty-spike kelpiens can shoot spikes the xindi would also be very versatile and would be suited for many different environments ship combat would be harder to make any kind of decision on especially when they’re using the same ships
1704,startrek,holy shit — that’s it  i’ve had such a hard time figuring out what felt so off about the dynamic when i was watching this show and that’s it: it’s a millennial dynamic in the absolute most jarring and worst way
1705,startrek,plus the mysterybox is made semi-necessary by the nearly omnipresent nigh omnipotent yet child-like main character she is interesting because she deliberately limits herself in order to learn solve problems and overcome a genuine absent-mindedness it doesnt quite make as much sense for the highly trained crew of trek ships to be stumbling around chasing the chimeras of a single character which each happen to save existence itself
1706,startrek,ive been arguing these same things since the episodes aired clancy was absolutely justified both times in her reactions to picard we as viewers have much more information than she does she only knows that this doddering old fool who left starfleet in a huff 15 years earlier is in her office all but ordering her to giver him a ship just days after he blasted starfleet as no longer being starfleet in a very public interview sheer fucking hubris indeed even his friends warned him that it was a bad ideathe second time yeah he kept talking over her assuming she was about to shoot him down and even went so far as to insult her hes lucky she didnt just cut the comms then and there instead she just told him to shut the fuck up and informed him hed already made his case and she was going to bring backup to him
1707,startrek,the federation was never anti capitalist  its just in a post scarcity society everyone is functionally super-rich and a lot of capitalist structures become irrelevantthe issue isnt capitalism she was just using that as a justification for moral relativism
1708,startrek,voyager
1709,startrek,it was voyager episode unity in season 3
1710,startrek,our chihuahua was named khan so that to call her in from outside we could yell khaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
1711,startrek,&gt;my theory is that the discovery writers grew up on video games and think thats how your supposed to write for tvthat would actually explain a lot about dis hell it would explain a lot about modern tv in generalnot directly related but i remember reading some tweet from someone in the game industry bemoaning how most people they audition to write for their games just dont actually read or in general dont much consume stories in other formats most of their understanding of storytelling just comes from other video games its interesting to consider how that can affect writing
1712,startrek,i appreciate the kind words and glad we came to an understanding no hard feelings i hope your cousin and family/friends weather the storm and you as well
1713,startrek,eh i just really hate the style of new shows
1714,startrek,theres incompetent and lucky and then there is obviously living in a cartoon parody of the real world imagine lower decks with real-life actors and sets just doesnt work for me
1715,startrek,and dilithium jedi
1716,startrek,channeling her inner russell crowe
1717,startrek,you did it thank you so muchunity season 3 episode 17
1718,startrek,arent they their own empire though
1719,startrek,if i was getting choked out id probably stab the part that was actually choking me too  why was she even using a sleeper lock when she demonstrates a moment later she knows the vulcan pinch
1720,startrek,discovery is a terrible show and it isn’t surprising at all i love star trek but i knew it was fucked episode  1 season 1 i watched season 2 for them to kill what they did in season 1 just to get the trash that is season 3
1721,startrek,andorian antenna grow back if you cant use warp warp nacelles are completely useless the sphere data still makes discovery indestructible
1722,startrek,i very much appreciate your experience evidently im too used to humans believing their experiences are universal and took what you wrote in that vein my apologies i too have family/friends who have served and family/friends who are doctors and nurses so my particular experience which ive stated is not all encompassing isnt solely drawn from youtube videosi have a cousin whos a doctor in houston and he is covid positive i also have a friend who is a doctor and just recently got over covid ask them if theyve shed a tear or two or have been heavily affected by what theyve seen and theyll tell you yes that being said their experiences are also anecdotal there is no universal experience and i understand thatagain as a human being i dont think its unreasonable for people in certain situations to express their emotions despite their organizational positions this is why i have no issue with the character of michael being emotional weve seen every conceivable emotion from nearly every important star trek character since tos including the vulcans but this is the first time ive seen such outrage over itas i said i was not attempting to impugn your unique experiences and apologize if it read that way
1723,startrek,ferengicheating is a skill that applies to any contestand they would bribe the judges
1724,startrek,the needs of the many its the same morality that was struggled with by sisko in the pale moonlight and its ambiguous certainly hell its even the same race thats the subject so that they can target the dominion that small action at the cost of 1 life or reputation potentially saves millions how far does the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few/one
1725,startrek,that sounds right chakotay was the one that either already knew the blonde woman or was seduced by hermy google searches are still coming up short ill keep looking
1726,startrek,deleted
1727,startrek,oh my gosh the phillipa terra firma two-part storyline had me just playing on my phone to get through it i am usually so attentive but i hope that character never comes back and i was so confused why they were all saluting her at the end it was a waste of storytime
1728,startrek,2 some of the best trek is just dialogue scenes  we dont get much of that in disco so it was a treat3 i thought it was obvious osyraa intended the scientist to be the rep knowing she could control him  also thought it was obvious shes spoofing the biometrics especially since she pretended to be unfamiliar with it
1729,startrek,did all the other main characters whisper-cry 85% of their lines
1730,startrek,i feel like the title is the first half of a rodney dangerfield joke
1731,startrek,i slowly warmed up to discovery in season 2 and have really enjoyed season 3 but admittedly its not for everybody im still not really a huge fan of michael as a main character but thats something i can accept now that the rest of the cast is getting more of a spotlight in a big franchise like star trek itll always be impossible to satisfy everyone i myself didnt enjoy discovery at all during season 1 a lot of people like star trek for different reasons and have their preferred series so a few people will look at discovery and say its not really my bag as i once did and that’s fine people can like and dislike whatever they want
1732,startrek,i think it would be humans or vulcans
1733,startrek,fucking rick berman
1734,startrek,omg thank you
1735,startrek,yippie ki yay michaelburnham
1736,startrek,i dont mind that shes the main character in the show i mind that she seems to be the main character in the galaxy 
1737,startrek,they wouldnt be taken at all
1738,startrek,damage organisation and transport
1739,startrek,it was voyager chakote was the main cast member that episode
1740,startrek,you would disagreeseason 3 saw the departure from the more fanciful scifi plotlines and turned towards really exploring the characters and the human condition  for character exploration look to ensigns of command the most toys and the offspring for humor there was captains holiday deja q and ménage à troi for human condition exploration high ground defector and the hunted star trek lore sarek and of course two of the most exciting episodes yesterdays enterprise and best of both worldsit was certainly a powerhouse season not to mention the last season with a phenomenal scores bobw defector and booby trap are my personal favorites - which rick berman inexplicably hated and cut from future seasons
1741,startrek,- theres a difference between mild cursing and sheer fucking hubris  and an emotion chip that was still not properly calibrated too- its not puritanical and that bias is the core of your argument ultimately- no one said she cant be angry just thats not the way she should be expressing her anger anymore than she shouldnt whack him over the head with a padd also dont try to claim some kind of ersatz moral high ground by trying to make this into a misogyny thingthats as out of place in the federation as the f bombs themselves
1742,startrek,one thing i would change on yours is that dr who doesn’t only have one character he has companions and they are explored deeplyhe even has companions who are only there for two or three episodes they are still explored heavily explored more deeply than some of the long term characters in discovery
1743,startrek,great father quarks moral compass love him
1744,startrek,q just q q is fine go with q &amp;#x200b;if not then go with some word in klingon that matches its personality
1745,startrek,yeah but also *menage a troi*
1746,startrek,to be fair it seems riker and troi are in a poly or open relationship
1747,startrek,this is quite a lazy critique of the op youve managed to pull the race card the sexuality card and straw man the entire post
1748,startrek,it doesnt help that the supervising producer and sound crew who do the avr dont insist on standard pronunciations for the namesgen rhys has his family name pronounced variously as reese rice and riss with a soft i
1749,startrek,yeah but it’d be nice if we could keep some of the good characters in disco
1750,startrek,&gt; i guess youre just going to discount all of the stories from doctors and nurses especially in 2020 where they told us that they have been completely overwhelmed and/or broken downi never did any such thing i told you my experience as an rn in a military organization directly responding to your previous comment please do not put words in my mouth  indeed my experiences are anecdotal but quite fitting to the situation you presented which is why i chimed in my point being: those youtube videos youve seen are in my professional opinion the exception not the rulei was stationed in south korean from the end of 2019 to last month  i didnt see my wife and son for 370 days due to covid during that time i was an inpatient nurse for the only bedded air force facility on the korean peninsula  i saw people try to commit suicide by drinking bleach i saw people shot in the face horrible motocycle accidents all that while managing our response to covid my peers subordinates and commanders were like a family because we were all separated from ours so i take issue with you implying i discount stories of medical professionals breaking down during this pandemic  i lived it but we remained professional at work that was my experience as it related to your comment again i know youve seen youtube videos of rns or mds breaking down but i gave my real world account of it so dont put words in my mouth pleasethe rest of what you posted is whatever youre free to have your opinions about a tv showits crap like this why i rarely engage in online discussions  to think that id give a real world perspective and then be accused of discounting all the stories from doctors and nurses that have been completely overwhelmed  its just ridiculousproof here
1751,startrek,everything about the last few episodes of season 3 has been setting up michael as captainwere onto the third set of showrunners now and im sure the feeling in the writers room is that shoehorning michael into becoming the central figure of every plot is become as tiresome as it is watching it all unfold
1752,startrek,thank you 🙏🏼
1753,startrek,thank you
1754,startrek,kazon of the alpha quadrant trash absolute trashbut the ferengi are americans not jewish
1755,startrek,the dsc writers have failed smg and the character of burnham as badly as the jedi failed anakin
1756,startrek,yeah like 3x02wow this actually isnt a bad show when michael isnt in it oh wait there she is in the final 10 seconds
1757,startrek,theres a case to be made about synths and holos that determining their sentience is an important legal matter after all if you consider all simulated beings sentient then youre technically committing murder every time you go through a combat training holodeck program or theft if you go through a holonovel retelling of count of monte cristo so for cases like datas or the doctors or the exocomps the onus is on the entity themselves to make the case for their sentience it makes sense that datas legal status hadnt come up before because it was just sort of accepted that he was sentient but that was never formalised until maddox made a legal challenge that required it to be affirmed
1758,startrek,sarah mitich had an issue with the makeup so they replaced her as airiam and made a new character for her
1759,startrek,same here i didnt like it at first but we decided to give it a second shot and after getting through some of the first episodes we really started getting into itnow were eagerly awaiting the next episode every week this season has been amazing so far
1760,startrek,spare us the tired republicans versus liberals trope and stay on topic please
1761,startrek,presumably the crossfield class wasnt specifically designed for the spore drive experiments - the name implies theres a uss crossfield out there that wasnt part of this project - so id guess its an existing general use science ship that happened to be a good design for the spore drive
1762,startrek,he did a bunt
1763,startrek,because i think he was seriously considering the offer but he needed to prosecute osyrra in order to maintain the integrity of starfleet and the federation otherwise an alliance with the emerald chain would forever be tainted by osyrras crimes
1764,startrek,i meant from the morality angle
1765,startrek,exactly which is part of the problem trek has no place for characters that swear like tilly does she swears like any of my colleagues would which is not what the example of trek would suggestadmiral sheer fucking hubris cursing was good cursing it made her point it established how she felt about picards request very effectively she was incensed in a way that deserved profanity it serviced the story
1766,startrek,yeah going through a wormhole by yourself and then being thrown into a conflict between alien races does seem familiar
1767,startrek,well youre not wrong
1768,startrek,thats good i personally cant stand it but its nice to know it hits home with some people
1769,startrek,she’s the equivalent of ayala on voyager
1770,startrek,someone also graduated at the bottom of starfleet academywhich is to say them being in the same continuity doesnt mean that they cant still be incompetent and lucky
1771,startrek,or at least xo
1772,startrek,they both did
1773,startrek,tell that to cbsedit : if they are willing to give us it why noti know the odds are nill but they *did* green light a series based on fans reactions to anson and the like  its just for fun
1774,startrek,it would have been burnham and book separated from disc burnham and book looking for the source of the burn and disc looking for burnham and fed it would have been a series of disconnected episodes building the picture of the galaxy and some impending thereat posed by the burn in a two part finale they finally reunite when burnham and book find out the burn was part of the signal designed by ai to call the ai guardians as seen in picard it originated in dark space between the galaxies and the ai guardians are coming to our galaxy they find the fed where its as it was found in this series a fraction of itself when they find out the cause if the burn section 31 let disc know where they imprisoned deactivated ai but its too far for the fee to reach when disc gets there they find a deactivated picard and ochi who when activated are told what has occured and their help is needed it ends when disc jumps to the fed which has been destroyed by the ai
1775,startrek,you mean like a real ship crazy
1776,startrek,it explains how it was abused during the temporal cold war
1777,startrek,interesting how your examples are of very important story arcs of characters that werent the main protagonist the criticism here is not about small-universe syndrome as youre trying to paint it instead it compares how those used to be ensemble shows to the way this one is relentlessly focused on just one person i think its valid criticism and youre being very patronising with this ill-concealedly disdainful retort
1778,startrek,what’s there to understand it’s pretty straightforward
1779,startrek,can someone please help me understand whom plays lt cmdr airiam it appears to be mostly played by hannah cheesman but when you look at imdb sarah mitich lt nilsson it shows a bunch of pictures of her as airiam
1780,startrek,vance said not just eat shit but you are literally eating my shit right now paraphrasing to a slaving torturing genocidal interstellar warlord and it was truethat deserves a medal
1781,startrek,almost all swearing in nutrek has been to service character either to emphasize the informal nature of the character ie tilly and reno or the depth of emotion a character is feeling ie admiral sheer fucking hubris
1782,startrek,&gt;i believe sisko is actually the bridge officer who appears in the fewest episodes of ds9sisko is actually in every single ds9 episode hes the only ds9 character who is  but he very frequently is not the center of attention he just appearswhich i believe was really your point anyway  and i agree  :
1783,startrek,i think i’d like it more if it didn’t have the trek name at least then it could be its own thing
1784,startrek,not like im lucky to be alive oh wait i am without medicine i wouldnt have survived past 20 due to one pesky deletion from one geneim a see the ability not the disability guy not a special snowflake guy its more likely that some one will abort a baby for having genes that cause downs syndrome yet they can live fulfilling lives its just society considers them defective thats why i think its ableist to call them defects
1785,startrek,ds9 didn’t mix series plot with stand alone episodes though that’s what made it worktheir series episodes were important at driving the series storyline forward discovery’s series episodes do very little at driving it forward because 90% of the episode tende to be unrelatedthat’s why it’s like a jigsaw in discovery
1786,startrek,i think youre missing the *entire* point
1787,startrek,yep plus norm macdonald
1788,startrek,oh like when discovery non-violently brokered peace between earth and the mysterious raiders or how the situation on trill was ultimately resolved by peaceful cooperation and the sb-19 data was obtained from nivar through dialogue
1789,startrek,we cant have nice things
1790,startrek,i would not have stuck around so long if the trek name wasnt on this
1791,startrek,for real its like being back at tng with a little less depth a lot of extra humour and better vfx
1792,startrek,could you please explain what you just wrote i cant understand it at all
1793,startrek,actually that was addressed within the episode &gt;captain sisko: “do you think the other federation worlds are going to sit back and let their president be replaced by a military dictatorship”&gt;admiral leyton: “hardly a dictatorship ben”&gt;captain sisko: “overthrowing a legitimately elected president and giving starfleet direct control over the government sounds like a dictatorship to me and i’m sure i won’t be the only one who thinks so”&gt;admiral leyton: “there’ll be some dissenters at first but they’ll fall in line once they realize strengthening earth is the first step toward strengthening the federation”&gt;captain sisko: “and if they don’t agree what then are you willing to risk civil war if the lakota fires on the defiant you’ll be opening a pandoras box that may never be closed”
1794,startrek,discovery is capitalist revisionist trek
1795,startrek,facist italy i think all militarised but cant conquer anything of value then ride scooters through the streets of cardassia prime saying ciao
1796,startrek,it couldnt be that the federation president is just more of a political figurehead at this point and the only reason why they continue to have one is because its tradition i guess its been umpteen centuries for crying out loud and i think having one person in charge of all of that is kind of insane and impractical  so i think that before the burn they did indeed have more of a parliamentary system in place in order to govern such a large swath of the galaxy as you said  i think that when osyraa asked to speak to the federation president it was very much akin to someone asking to speak to and negotiate with the queen of england because they werent totally aware of how the actual government functionedalso i guess maybe it gives us something that we can relate to or some kind of a connection to the past  i kind of want to see them go the culture route and just have a bunch of much smarter ai in control of everything with organic humanoid faces acting as just a series of checks against them with some power politically and practically speaking the federation just doesnt let on or tell anyone about this information because the ai are so advanced that its damn near impossible to figure out who might be one and who might just be a normal person
1797,startrek,i guess youre just going to discount all of the stories from doctors and nurses especially in 2020 where they told us that they have been completely overwhelmed and/or broken downhow about all the videos that have been shared of this very thing human beings are human beings and can only take so much so to say that youve never seen it is anecdotal at bestthat aside i know im just one person and i dont expect everyone to respond or not respond like me but it has never once dawned on me to say oh no michael is crying again i mean does her emotional expression really affect people that much i guess if i take anything from this sub thats a yes i suppose im not as serious about my trek as some people thats not a slight on people who do take it seriously ive watched every iteration of trek there is but im not a hardcore trekkie so i dont get enraged about continuity or lack thereof fan service or lack thereof what trek is or isnt etc i just take things in stride and watch it for what it is
1798,startrek,the cardassians felt like a mix of nazi germany fascist italy and a more generic totalitarian regime
1799,startrek,maybe this is the benefit of having a personal transporter
1800,startrek,klingons to social justice is why i am tired of this show this show has gone way away from major conflict to who is gay who is trans and only woman can be on the bridge
1801,startrek,first episode: plays out as it does but *discovery* arrives as a **deus ex machina** to save the day no need for them to arbitrarily crash into a planetfirst half of the season: fish-out-of-water troupes galore as the crew takes a history 201 class to catch up on 900 years of history  *discovery* retrofit without the -a fan service  not much action because we spend time with each main and supporting character every actor listed in the opening credits and empathize with how they each are struggling to adjust to their new lives and role in the new federation  the emerald chain gets a backstory episode to put them on par with how we understood the dominion when they hit the *ds9* scene ie weyouns first appearance  *section 31* backdoor pilot to get georgiou on her new path without mucking up the second half of the seasonsecond half of the season: clear goals for the crew are set  the burn mystery because the vulcans &amp; romulans are withholding vital information b/c fucking hubris is there to play out and the emerald chain has to be dealt with lets see some ~~wicked witch of the universe-~~osyraa-centric scenes for perspective  a vance-centric flashback episode to further expound upon the state of the galaxy before *discovery*s arrival laying clues and red herrings about the burn  everything culminates as it currently is both solving the mystery about the burn and forging an uneasy peace with the chain to be undermined by georgious revitalized section 31because cronenberg cured her no time travel necessary but shoehorn in the guardian of forever for her character development  shes the morally-gray badass the current federation needs  promote tilly to lieutenant and give her a station on the bridge; relegate any of the other bridge crew to engineering so stamets and reno can be the foils that help develop their character
1802,startrek,the ferengi represented the most extreme form of capitalism
1803,startrek,holdovers from the other post they couldnt get enough i guess they really need us to know
1804,startrek,&gt;	apparently shes the best choiceas if it’s a *choice* at all where is the chain of command on discovery who is the second officer that would assume the first officer position when it became vacant why do they pretend that you’d interview for the job like any other that there’d be interviews and a candidate selection where tilly could “get **offered** the job” she was a cadet in season 1  a cadet  now somehow she was the “best” choice for xo what the fuck and then the largely-nameless and unexplored bridge crew are all assembled to clap for her new job honestly this is dumb and what’s worse is the admiral doesn’t question saru when saru decides that an ensign is the **best** choice for first officer on starfleet’s only ship with a spore drive and then why are they still wearing 1000-year old uniforms i dunno i love star trekbut not discovery
1805,startrek,rom is the bomb
1806,startrek,i like discovery its different and not as bland as the last trek series we got yknow the one that ended as a holo-noveli get that some people dont like it thats fine also the previous series arent going anywhere so you can rewatch them all the timewhat i find slightly irritating are the subliminal attempts in this community to convince everyone that discovery is indeed an objectively bad series and that people should stop watching and stop enjoying itjust let everyone enjoy what they like its not like we dont have 3 other upcoming/running series that we can watch if we dont like discovery
1807,startrek,just a 12 minute long static shot of it roll credits
1808,startrek,rom is great i just watched family buisness hes great in that episode
1809,startrek,your memory isn’t playing tricks on you in bride of chaotica voyager is experiencing power shortages resulting in the leaving active of only four remaining lavatories with lineups beginning to form and neelix was particularly concerned about the bolians
1810,startrek,
1811,startrek,progressive doesnt have to be woke when people say woke they mean performative
1812,startrek,in addition to the millions of jews they killed they also killed millions of slavs esp russians poles serbs and belarusians and soviet pows of any ethnicity
1813,startrek,theyve had a few nods to farscape in this season so far and i think the show had a greater impact than we realize on a lot of writers spread out across various genres
1814,startrek,deleted
1815,startrek,or more of those mind control headbands that they put on paul which they could easily slap on the rest of the bridge crew
1816,startrek,maybe they have but at this point are people still not believing what the producers told us did we think they were lying to us when they said the show would center on a specific member of the crewi get wanting the show to be broader character-wise i think one of the best decision the showrunners for orange is the new black made was to pull the focus back somewhat from piper and dive further into all of the other characters in that prisoni sincerely think discovery could benefit from this approach but im under no impression that theyll do that and have accepted that the show they told us it was going to be is exactly what were getting
1817,startrek,maybe theres too much of a risk of taking the colon along for the rideits like how we still use a cart with wheels to move things around or still take baths/showers
1818,startrek,just recently started season 3 after a long hiatus bc i just wasnt that interested and every time i thought in relief it wasnt gonna be the michael burnham show i was sorely corrected before the end of the episode
1819,startrek,really i had no idea  im sure im not the only one who is seriously impressed that youve contributed this phenomenally original comment to the discussion
1820,startrek,i would fucking pay to see carl have a conversation with a group of ferengi privateers bonus if jeff combs has  supporting role
1821,startrek,this is the way
1822,startrek,i like him and everything but not every good character on this show needs their own spinoff
1823,startrek,except everything in that episode made sense from a strategic and tactical point of view
1824,startrek,
1825,startrek,guardian of forever doing what
1826,startrek,im ok with things looking more advanced in some respects even enterprise was more advanced than tosi love how disco has woven in some of the tos and tas into it in season 1 &amp; 2 i thought pike was done well especially when he went back to talos ivstill yes i think it is good to have gone beyond tng etc i wonder if they ended up doing that so they could stop all the negative comments about canon which gets me thinking weve not seen any klingons yet
1827,startrek,look around theres tons of fair criticism even in this sub which is tightly controlled try adding an underscore between star and trek and youll find much more its not toxic to wish for better writing for our beloved franchise
1828,startrek,yesterday’s enterprise is considered the turning point
1829,startrek,my head canon is that data tested out of most of the academy he arrives on the enterprise d so naive that its impossible to believe he had a normal academy experience
1830,startrek,love how the women are always the negative every karen i know irl is amazing
1831,startrek,i respect your opinion but wish you wouldnt use ad-hominems when i have clearly made a lot of allowances that my opinion is fallible in my post it would make it easier for me and others to digest your feedback if it wasnt couched in insulting verbiage
1832,startrek,solid season 8 material
1833,startrek,i see romi upvote
1834,startrek,im a destiny player and this whole osyraa vs osiris plotline is amazing lol trek and destiny nerd here
1835,startrek,am i made of pizza if i ate enough of it
1836,startrek,hes easily become my favorite star trek admiral i was absolutely convinced that they were going to go the route of making him an antagonist is an obstacle to overcome like admirals in trek usually are or even make him the big bad of the season its been one of the highlights of the season that they didnt use that tired cliche
1837,startrek,&gt;its the same make-up that was used at enterpriseits not  the s3 dsc orion make-up uses a full facial prosthetic ents orions had some prosthetics for the males none for the females but was primarily face-paint  the s1 dsc orions also used no prosthetics
1838,startrek,he has no emotions so he has nothing to fearmaybe he will be left in a room for hours and do nothinglol
1839,startrek,hes amazing starfleet to the core especially in sticking to his guns on prosecuting osyrra if theres a deal to be made with the emerald chain
1840,startrek,thank you for teaching me the name of this trope
1841,startrek,osyraas ship has those mechanical tentacles and theres a line at the beginning of the episode where the admiral talks about how she infiltrated discoverys mycelial field its new but not ignored
1842,startrek,well said and happy cake day
1843,startrek,ds9 finale -- kira damar and garak end up at dominion hq and damar bites it they keep going we stop for nothing those were his orders
1844,startrek,i just want them to stop crying and holding each other tenderly every 3 minutes
1845,startrek,*the name of the rose* is absolutely positively driven by the main character he pushes his mentor in directions that otherwise would not have been taken
1846,startrek,
1847,startrek,sadly rank doesnt seem to have a bearing on being first officer under saru  reno stammets nillson detmer and a few others were had seniority
1848,startrek,this is the correct answer
1849,startrek,thats like saying *datas day* is just having data watch whats happening and he has nothing to do with it instead hes central to the entire episode the episode would not and could not happen without him being there at that time in that placefurther the topic is trek so lets find a trek reference
1850,startrek,she might be written poorly thats the writers fault not the characters  the character does not exist shes fictional everything is on the writers  besides those other shows you mentioned took the time to flesh out all the other characters and even gave them arcs of their own thats why a lot of people dislike discovery
1851,startrek,they come across like people who have had too much plastic surgery
1852,startrek,its not gatekeeping
1853,startrek,yep this is another of the discovery bad because i am a true fan posts
1854,startrek,netflix has them if they still have themi think prime does as well pluto tv seems to switch on and off
1855,startrek,theyve done breathe episodes people bitched that they were boring and filler
1856,startrek,i support this viewsource: am half-kiwi
1857,startrek,well said  im really disappointed that we knew almost nothing about these bridge crew members  its a ahame
1858,startrek,yes its also possible to interpret his growth as a criticism of ferengi society the ferengi reward those with a natural talent for profit there is no vested interest in educating those who will not provide a good return on investment rom was left behind because his society never invested in him the ufp are not like this and once he is taught by someone obrien who doesnt go in with the same bias he proves hes actually an adept learner
1859,startrek,im not gonna argue your points because if you dont like the show you dont like itbut it shouldnt be a revelation that this is star trek burham its how the show was pitched a main character like the original series but instead of being the captain it would be someone lower in the chain of the command which is what we got
1860,startrek,q went from a menacing god like entity that holds the fate of humanity in his hands to some stalker who begs janeway for some nookie  loved the tng iteration and i love the actor  but they tried too hard to shoehorn him into later series
1861,startrek,things were  different in the 60s
1862,startrek,derailing the entire show for a two-episode backdoor pilot right before the three-part finale didnt help at all either  those should have been part of the first half of the season which itself should have focused on the *discovery* crew adapting to the future setting burnham re-integrating to starfleet and fleshing out both the emerald chain and the mystery surrounding the burn
1863,startrek,burnham will never be captain though because the show-runners came in with the intention to make this a deliberately different trek show and they had three central tenets of that philosophy:1 it would not be a captain-driven show2 it would not be an ensemble cast but focus on one main character3 it would be an anthology series changing it up each seasonnow obviously that third tenet wasnt quite as etched in stone as the first twoand i think thats the problem  if we swapped out the cast every season a la ahs then we wouldnt be reaching such an absurd level of burnham fatigue here in s3  it would make more sense if youre only going to have a cast for 12 episodes or whatever that you dont spend time deep-diving into each character but just pick one to really develop  the shows direction would make more sense thenbut they abandoned the idea of anthology and we ended up with this bastardized version of that plan where they stubbornly hold burnham as the central focus yet stubbornly keep her out of the captaincy just so they can still maintain the idea that this trek is different
1864,startrek,yeah there are quite a few times when they seem to forget they have either transporters or shuttles it’s even more prevalent in tos i recall the one episode where sulu is freezing on a  planet but they can’t get him because the transporters are dividing people into good and evil halves i don’t think they had even thought of shuttles at this early point in the series
1865,startrek,how are there star trek fans who dont realise its a post scarcity world in which capitalism is obsolete
1866,startrek,argeeded ifor me though t think the tos community problems were holding the show back theyve bused past that and tng and gotten really good
1867,startrek,i saw him say somewhere that he had been on set filming season 4 i don’t remember exactly where but i’ll see if i can find it again
1868,startrek,not anymore
1869,startrek,completely agree
1870,startrek,i was writing articles pop culture-related articles for websites and was involved in the fan scene for some uk tv shows i became good friends with a writer and at some point started doing notes for him as a favour and it went from there if youre friends with any writers ask them if you can read their scripts or drafts theres often a lot they can gain from an extra pair of eyes even if youre not an experienced editor or copy editor its a good way to find out whether you have an eye for it or not if you arent friends with any writers start hanging out in writer twitter threads and see if it leads to any acquaintances if youre into writing or editing already yourself you can also find some suitable facebook groups and subreddits for your preferred genre or writing style and meet people on therei spent most of my childhood and youth reading and have a vivid imagination so for me its relatively easy to read a script and see a scene play out in my mind and remark on possible timing issues id recommend getting into reading plays instead of novels its somewhat more demanding of the reader and most people find it less fun but it will help a lot to train your brain to pay attention to the right thingsfor another example ive made graphic design my full-time work for now and i kind of randomly ended up in a writing-related fb group but more marketing-leaning copywriting offered a random desperate person some help and advice and that led to my first book cover and probably band t-shirts for the same guy this year employed full-time or freelancing i always made sure i had a small budget of pro bono hours to offer other people help not with any specific goal in mind but it does often seem to lead to paid work later
1871,startrek,and the best member for a suicide mission just went through a time portal 2 episodes ago
1872,startrek,a lot of us domany of us stopped engaging with negative threads here around season 2 so it might seem like opinion is skewed its been non-stop since the first images were released and it gets old
1873,startrek,voy ds9 and ent were set in the same universe and the nobility of the federation was never in discussion the authors had to work with the utopian setting and make it interesting which was harder
1874,startrek,the star trek i like is star trek the star trek i dont like isnt star trek
1875,startrek,i thought the same thing when i first saw her this season i got the same feeling as when commander macduff appeared in tng’s conundrum
1876,startrek,in *tos* the romulans were supposed to represent communist china so that could explain itin the berman era i don’t think they were supposed to represent a specific country though i think nazi germany was the biggest influence on the depiction of the romulans and cardassians in that era but they were definitely totalitarian
1877,startrek,i can respect him and still want him to transport into my pants and i do lol
1878,startrek,thanks a lot
1879,startrek,plus with saru gone she got really over confident
1880,startrek,pretty sure hes on my raspberry pi right next to super mario snes
1881,startrek,well she is quite high considering she is given conn when saru and michael aren’t present
1882,startrek,&gt;  that’s okay because there’s trek that i do likeexactly so
1883,startrek,whenever people listed their least favorite to favourite characters q would always be on the bottom you can search it up online
1884,startrek,thank you for reading
1885,startrek,the fact that you had to jump online into a discussion forum to find out who she is is one of the glaring problems with *discovery*  outside of burnham saru tilly and stamets we know next to nothing about any of the rest of the bridge crew  theyre just there as background dressing and yet we the audience are expected to be emotionally invested in them case in point: airiams funeral  such a shame and the onus is wholly on the writers room
1886,startrek,im sorry my agreement wasnt enough but now the name of the rose you have misunderstood just as the servant in the story misunderstands events and reads a nonexistent pattern driving his masters investigation to a futile end  you see i do read umberto eco  and the monks are hardly detached observers
1887,startrek,i disagree the struggle to get there is supposed to have happened before tos writing for star trek has always been more complicated because of the utopian setting; its easier to write dystopia than it is utopia the latter risks being boring hence it calls for more sophisticated writing stp took the easy route
1888,startrek,thank you to the mods for putting this back the comment i saw from a mod was that it’d been  just because it said “it isn’t star trek” which seems a bit disrespectful to the author given that they took the time and effort to back up their opinion and provide specific actionable reasons for itto me it came across as the post being  just because the mod disagreed with it and a step towards enforced groupthink on this subreddit which itself seems decidedly un-star trek&gt; with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censured the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably the first time any mans freedom is trodden on were all damaged
1889,startrek,one criticism of disco i see is that burnham solves everything and is the crux of every major event in the showthat is what trek has always done in every seriessisko was the emmisary and defeated the dominionjaneway crippled the borgpicard ensured humanities first contact and went toe to toe with qevery main character of each series has always been the savior of not only the ship/crew but the whole galaxy/quadrant/space time continuum
1890,startrek,i was told that there would be valid critiques and all there i got was “dae think black lady too smart”fuck the queers too i guess they were just shown doing all the work analyzing and figuring out the source of the burn but nevermind that we need the 5 billionth “black lady bad” threadi didn’t think that was star trek guess i wrong
1891,startrek,the orville is doing a much better job at carrying on the trek legacy with good jokes too
1892,startrek,no i forgotill be honest the first season is kind of a blank in my memory i just didnt enjoy it but thats mei know a lot of people did
1893,startrek,you are not being downvoted because youre right picard is the worst trek ever by a lot for the reasons you mentioned and more
1894,startrek,that referred to freakin fascism not people being salty about a show you like utterly hysterical
1895,startrek,deleted
1896,startrek,i must say i am glad to see so many others that feel similarly discovery is a steaming pile of nonsense that is the furthest from trek you can get and yet people tack their own virtue signaling on to the shows&amp;#x200b;it could have been sooooooooo cool instead we got garbage that used every link to established lore and then burned those bridges after crossing them even picard is guilty of this
1897,startrek,the premise that the federation was such an utopia made writing interesting stories about it way harder to write previous writing teams somehow still managed because they were really good at it the people in charge now dont have what it takes so they had to resort to ruining roddenberrys vision to get some conflict upon which to base a plot
1898,startrek,there are over 600 episodes of other trek shows for you to watch
1899,startrek,this post was  because you have a new account and we get a lot of spam from newly created accounts if your post is not spam please send a message to the mods **with the url of this post** letting them know so they can fix it for you llap*i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit/message/compose/to=/r/startrek if you have any questions or concerns*
1900,startrek,in *tos* the federation represented the us the klingons represented the ussr and the romulans represented china though the romulans also took inspiration from ancient romein the berman era the klingons were inspired by vikings and samurai the cardassians and romulans represented totalitarian states nazi germany was probably the biggest inspiration for them but i don’t think it was the only inspiration for them and the ferengi represented the most extreme form of capitalism
1901,startrek,workers of the world unite - you have nothing to lose but your chains
1902,startrek,its more centric around michael than on the crew of the full ship they are quite stupid in the decision making thats uncommon in star trek commonly the captains and crew take good decisions and are good at following orders while in discovery they continuously take bad decisions and repeat the same mistakes over and over again not learning from their past mistakesalso lets take into consideration that star fleet is a military body yet the crew in discovery does not behave like in military its more like a trade ship that happens to have some star fleet personnelalso st discovery is forcing itself to be controversial like in your face with having a gay engineer and medical staff instead of treating that with a normal in the future the same with tal and gray characters to much in your face that they are transgender and non-binary that relationship is so forced there is no chemistry between the characters they can use the same circumstances gay non-binary and transgender with no issue and not forcing it making it more fluid into the story i love the fact that they show this diversity because its real and normal not need to in your face because its not normalway to much drama the dr and the engineer i love you but i need my space but want to be with you but no so much but may be try again but its too much its annoying also the relationships of michael with the klingon-human and with book are useless fillers not adding anything to the story just drama for the sake of dramano consistency in the story:\- the ship is sentient and is protecting us - yet it does nothing against the emerald chain\- the red angel suit has auto-pilot and self destruct - yet i refuse to use that and pilot it myself\- the ship computer can be locked to avoid being controlled by other people like when they return from the mirror universe and the admiral took control of discovery - yet they didnt use it\- the ship can jump anywhere in the galaxy in a blink of an eye - yet we decide to stay next to the nebula and confront the emerald chain this is the more annoying for me they use that ship at war because of that feature they could jump back to federation hq wait a little and then jump inside the nebula and rescue all the team then jump back to hq and prepare to fight the emerald chain
1903,startrek,agreed
1904,startrek,i still dont see ityou think that their elevated language is unrealistic and merely a vestige of broadcast tv censorship but i think its perfectly realistic and a big aesthetic part of the idealistic elevated nature of the federation compared to our modern society  after all they didnt even use the curse words they were *allowed* toi think its cynical to say that theyre really no different than us because the whole point is that they are different than us theyre better than us they represent who we hope we can become  if you start to reject that or elements of that like they dont casually swear like we do anymore youre rejecting the fundamental narrative premise of trek itself
1905,startrek,it reached new levels with this episode too trying to turn micheal into john mcclaini halfway expected her to get on the comms and say ho ho ho ive got a phaser or yippee ay ki yay motherfuckeri mean they even used a jeffries tube for the air duct scene
1906,startrek,what is kurtzmans obsession with making jokes about replicator food being shit
1907,startrek,she doesnt do anything science-related whatsoever though small detail
1908,startrek,&gt; she seems to be quite high in rankwell she cant be *that* high in rank or she would have been made first officer
1909,startrek,the difference is that he was actually an engineer and he did engineery stuff
1910,startrek,sure i gave an example here earlier if i remember it maybe ill do some notes on the next episode while watching i dont know how good theyll be i worked on british comedy before if this was a work gig id take some time to prepare for it rewatching great examples of drama &amp; taking notes
1911,startrek,im not sure about the cardassians they are a militarised society that mraybe more like n korea
1912,startrek,i have a like/dislike thing going with it overall i am a fanbut some of what they do is top tier trek stuff but then some of it is among the worst shit ive ever seen michael burnham is hit and miss sometimes i find myself rooting for her and feeling for her and other times i want to slap her i like pretty much every other character though the bridge crew is great i just wish they would be more involved or get more focus and i love emperor georgiou   and pike is just about perfecti didnt mind too much what they did with the klingons i thought the look was weird but once they got their hair back it was fine what i didnt like was what they did with section 31 and control and i was mildly annoyed by a show being set 10 years before tos having more advanced tech than in tng/ds9/voy but i have made peace with that and the show being where it is now kind of negates that a bitthe show definitely has gotten better as its gone along which is about on par for star trek overall i enjoy it
1913,startrek,glad you decided to give it a shot it will grow on you i ended up being very attached to all the characters theres no one specific character who steals the show its really a choral endeavour all the characters are given arcs and space to grow instead on for example focusing on just one of them theres also great consistency with the rest of the star trek universe and the whole story is very coherent and well written enjoy
1914,startrek,despite the clearly roman influences ds9-era romulans always had a communist chinese vibe to me  i dont really have a good argument to back that up
1915,startrek,such a great character can’t believe the character changes he went through though: he started as just another ferengi then he was “rom the idiot” then he was a mechanical genius with poor social skills
1916,startrek,thats about the same as the scotty example and they werent exactly able to do it successfully for days just long enough to purge the system get them out there is nothing remaining from transport to duplicate or recall a pattern after you cant beam back a non-dead version of ensign ricky after hes killed on the planet or pop another copy of him out of the banks theres nothing in there
1917,startrek,their shields were down after the mini-burn that also knocked out the cloak someone specifically states they are down
1918,startrek,i enjoy discovery too even the first 2 seasons but i understand the complaintsi think it shines more when it remembers that the ship is just as important component to the show as anything else by that i mean that we dont need a savior character who is the only one able to fight to use diplomacy or science its ok to have episodes that focus on one character its not ok for the character to be the focus of the season its getting to a point where we will not wonder what the mystery will be but rather how will michael solve itat the same time i think the fans might need to adapt with the show and let go a bit of the nostalgia every trek show that came after tos faced this it was never up to the standart of the past until it did doesnt mean we cant critic but its easier to complain now then it were before both because its easier to voice our opinions and find people that agree and because its easier to access content and just go back to the classics and its nostalgia feeling of greatness better yet if you skip the worse parts and weaker episodes
1919,startrek,i think its hilarious how after that other thread listed out all these great arguments about why discovery doesnt work for them and now there have been like 4 threads in response basically being like be positive and like the show and michael as is or youre wrong and need to leave also sorry the sensitive locked your reasonable comment for saying the m-name s-name term
1920,startrek,tng ds9 and voyager all took 2-4 seasons before they hit a formula that worked tos and enterprise was close to hitting a stride but were both cancelled earlyim enjoying it i just want new trek its not like the trek of old but that doesnt necessarily make it bad
1921,startrek,itd be millions of dollars
1922,startrek,:-/
1923,startrek,i agree 1000% the best star trek shows were about the entire cast not one god damn person i’m really starting to get annoyed by how michael is the center of everything as you said is this st discovery or st michael burnham even st picard i love the character but god damn i hate this new way of making shows where the plot has to last an entire season and focus on one person or else i miss the “story of the week” episodes that tng voyager and ds9 had i miss those shows so much i like that they’re doing so much star trek now but i don’t like the direction at all it just seems to me like it goes against genes original vision for st
1924,startrek,i would go back to the beginning and take out all the parts of michael crying all of them ever because stop
1925,startrek,im going to have to figure out how gold works this is perfect if its not for you thats fine move on sometimes the shows age differently too  it took me 10 years to appreciate ds9 but i find it more re-watchable than a lot of tng i find enterprise to be cringey so i dont watch it  i find voyager to be repetitive so i watch it in chunks
1926,startrek,moogieeee :-\\
1927,startrek,you funny hahaha must be fishing for downvotes also you should look up what crying means because you sound overly emotional me im just about to fade happy new year think ill sleep until sunday what was in that drink&amp;#x200b;\---&amp;#x200b;also not your buddy pal dude or any other familiar masculine pronoun if you use any for me use formal female
1928,startrek,i’ll be interested in knowing what you think of it
1929,startrek,i salute you for starting on tos and not getting turned off by it it wasn’t my cup of tea and i’ve never watched much of it if i was you after you get through tos i would watch all the tos movies which are all decent to great up til generations hold off on that til you are done or almost done with tng then watch it i would start ds9 after tng and generations is over or if you want to be more timeline accurate start watching some ds9 after the tng crew visits deep space 9 the tng movies call all he watched to this point besides nemesis hold off on that after ds9 jump right into voyager a few important bits are introduced in ds9 for voy so i’d wait til you finish ds9 after voyager watch nemesis then lower decks after that’d i’d go to enterprise then discovery at that point you will be very well versed is trek lore so the jj movies will be either much better or much worse for you but i’d watch them at that point and after that picardno matter how you do it i’m glad you like it and i envy you for having sooooo much new stuff to watch
1930,startrek,when the writers have a choice between making a character clever and strategic or bad ass and tactical they go with “badass” at the expense of the plotso for instance a character will have the element of surprise but instead of using it will contact their rival and let them know where they are and what they are doing giving up the advantage nobody is thinking carefully through the problem they’re just rushing in phasers blasting
1931,startrek,oh ***no***
1932,startrek,youre right killing one nephew is not nearly as bad as a slave society or capitalism
1933,startrek,sure  look at how the world would be different if george bailey wasnt around  look at how different the federation would be if the enterprise-c wasnt at the right place to stop the war  same story different names
1934,startrek,while there has got to be some twist about him and the federation maybe that it doesnt exist beyond him vance has been a brilliant addition to the show its a shame that he probably will die as will book because he makes michael happy and we cant have a happy michael
1935,startrek,yeah thats why i gave up on docotor who after 10 seasons it got kind of old and very predictable i gave the new doc a shot because it was a whole new creative team so i was hoping itd be tweaked but it was pretty much the same old stuff
1936,startrek,it was
1937,startrek,dead on it was bugging me when i first saw her and now i know why lol
1938,startrek,ill join the choir and say i agree the writing of this show is getting more and more amateurish each episode at the end of 3x12 my gf and i looked at each other saying wtf did we just watch i hope kurtzman is  from the entire franchise as soon as possible and we get someone even remotely competent ideally someone who understands star trek even just a little to bring it back to life this is unbearable
1939,startrek,&gt; you cant figure it out by actually watchingbecause unlike a good mystery show they dont give you any clues until the very end
1940,startrek,id assume not surely those are under the direct jurisdiction of their homeworld like provinces within the larger political body
1941,startrek,the bathrooms are right above the replicators
1942,startrek,in my head rom invents a sealess stem bolt that makes self sealing stem bolts obsolete  he is able to patent his design and secure a monopoly on their manufacturing and distribution throughout the alpha and gamma quadrants  quark eventually winds up working for him as a factory overseer and is constantly screwing up as according to rom  quark just doesnt have the lobes for engineering
1943,startrek,his best role was as the gigolo in deuce bigalow
1944,startrek,there wasn’t even an explanation tbh“kid living alone gets scared entire universe affected”  like what
1945,startrek,i am extremely disappointed that georgiou is gone to another time for the section 31 show  with the federation in the state that it appears to be in and the whole trek universe to explore in the future without being overly burdened by past canon it was the perfect setting for her to be a snarky martial-arts-master spy facing off against emerald chain operatives liberating political prisoners destabilizing local governments etc  and michael would be the perfect sidekick for herevery point op makes in the season 3 section are the exact reasons why shifting burnham to the section 31 show seems like the only way *discovery* can become a more rounded ensemble show mixing classic trek problem-solving episodes with exploration-action episodes as the crew is tasked with bringing former federation worlds back into the fold encountering new spatial phenomena new to them familiar to us in the same vein as tng-&gt;tos callbacks and evolving the rest of the bridge crew into full-fledged characters we can get know and naturally know their personalities instead of being force-fed one-liners to define them
1946,startrek,i wonder if they consulted with anyone from the military to understand how the ranks you know work when bsg was i was working with a ton of former navy guys and they used to tell me how spot on the procedures and stuff in bsg was
1947,startrek,i couldnt have said it better myself id just like to add that the characters expressing extreme emotion every few scenes really drains any of the tension from anything they do think about any of burnhams breakdowns and compare it to picard crying there are 4 lights or to worf learning of jadzias death the latter two are deep meaningful moments to everyone who loves trek; i cant even remember what any of burnhams last 5 or 6 breakdown were about they happen so often they lose any meaning or gravitas
1948,startrek,being prone to overacting its just natural that she can pull off something like this so easily
1949,startrek,“when you flush the toilet where does it go  that sounds like an engineering question” - archer
1950,startrek,i agree with you on #1 but unfortunately its more complicated the bridge crew actors are all credited as supporting actors not main cast  in order to have stories told about them how we want theyd have to renegotiate all their contracts  that is pretty unlikely to happen; my best hope is that we get short treks about them
1951,startrek,&gt; a lot of writers these days are structuring their scripts like a 5-year-old tells a story and then heand then sheand thenand thenand then and absolutely nothing beyond the superficial list of things the character didits all jj abrams fault im kind of joking and kind of not his movies and shows have all been like that lost and then theres a smoke monster omg what is the smoke monster and then they find a bunker what about the smoke monster and then theres a polar bear in the tropics thats weird and then the bunker opens and they have to put in hurles numbers
1952,startrek,yeah right because every planet joins out of 100% altruistic reasons especially in the burn era also ossyra might be the only member of the emreald chain with the clout and power to actually negiotiate the merger of the chain and the federation with all those stipulations if the federation was really that hard up on morality treaty members then why make deals with the romulans or klingons
1953,startrek,well ignoring the gatekeeping quality of your remark i would like you to look at this breakdown of the dialogue lines per character in the original series kirk consistently has the most lines and yes other characters have some stories i apologize for my hyperbole but he is the main character by most measures even leaving aside the backstage machinations by shatner well documented that kept it his show  he was always the primary focus and star sure for instance “for the world is hollow and i have touched the sky” has a mccoy emphasis but even in this show kirk is the mover and shaker the one who like burnham saves the day i would think this was obvious find me a show that does not have kirk swaggering all about it and i will concede but the rest of your comments are about taste what this whole thread is about and what seems to have upset everybody and i was pointing out ‘valid criticism’ was simply opinion because the show didn’t live up to their ideas of what trek should look like this show is simply a different angle on trekcan’t wait to be downvoted for not saying disco sux
1954,startrek,deleted
1955,startrek,sorry you disagree buddy go cry somewhere else i stand by my words
1956,startrek,exactly the euphemism treadmill doesnt actually change anything theres nothing wrong with not wanting to sugar coat ones own struggles its not like you control your genome
1957,startrek,&gt; but but they had three conversations and now he sees himself as adiras father sorry mate i didnt feel like this was well earned at allalong those same lines the bond between georgiou and michael and the rest of the crew honestly didnt feel earned from a viewers perspective and that had a lot more time invested in it with more than enough opportunity in fact most of the actual connection came out in the episode where she left the series 🤔so i get that :pbut heres why i can give a pass to stamets culber and adira despite only having a handful of episodes devoted to it they established the bones of it narratively it was pretty clear that stamets had taken her under his wing and took a near-parental shine to her they also established that a lot of time has passed in-between off screen with the refit and stuff not a good excuse since that kind of thing also held true for georgiou and michael but its part of my calculus ;pfinally i kind of feel like this was a new thing for him like were seeing the climax of it all maybe even he didnt realize how much this would affect him i mean check the sequence of events in the episode:- he was already in a panic over culber being left behind but hes doing his duty- with the boarding of the ship the clock was ticking the nature of the questions given to emerald chain scientist show where his head is at- michael swoops in and saves the day- stamets finds out adira is also down there with culber- worse michael is putting discovery and his spore driver *over* the lives of people hes grown attached to -- now michael is the bad guy for him- suddenly feeling alone finding out both of the people hes emotionally invested himself in are in danger and this asshole -- this cause of all their problems in the first place -- is going to *let them die* oh god its all happening again- yeah hes gonna lose his absolute shit and unload on her and shes gonna neck pinch himthis worked for me it requires a little bit of filling in the blanks in-between episodes and theres even an argument to be made that maybe he got attached too quickly  but its an extremely human reaction it surprised me but it didnt exactly come out of left field as a subplot in a 13-episode season already packed with mysteries i can roll with it especially with anthony rapps performance herebut i can easily understand if it didnt click for you whatchagonnado :
1958,startrek,this comment section seems to hard disagree
1959,startrek,3- you mean like movie nights or crew dinners or the sass-fest with section 31 or magic to make the sanest man go mad  thats the knee-jerk list   there are surely more   you heres my homework on why you shouldnt like this show people are such paper tigers
1960,startrek,im expecting adira to be fine at least but this wouldnt be the first time they unceremoniously offed culber
1961,startrek,no i swear they mention them in voyager iirc something is going wrong on the ship and nelix is filling janeway in on issues and one of them is an out of order bathroom or maybe i am misremembering oh wait also kirk sits on a toilet in the brig in one of the movies
1962,startrek,you wanted an example i provided one im sorry youre not familiar with it but that doesnt invalidate the pointthe main character does not automatically need to be either the protagonist or the antagonist the main character is just the point of view for the reader/viewerthey do *not* have to be the one driving the storytry *the name of the rose* where the main character in this case the narrator is the servant of the protagonist his actions have no impact on the story hes just our eyes and ears for the events that happenim not saying this would work in dsc im just pointing out that the events of the show dont always have to end with michael burnham being right/saving the day/finding the answer/whatever which has become the shows biggest flaw its perfectly possible to have her remain the main character while allowing other people to be the protagonists
1963,startrek,what a weird thing for him to say  *yesterdays enterprise* was a remake of *its a wonderful life* with a few minor tweaks
1964,startrek,next up on the discovery channel
1965,startrek,with technology so advanced couldnt they carry dermal regenerators
1966,startrek,me too  i thought the first season was amazing unpopular opinion and i thought the second season sucked unpopular opinion despite how awesome pike was  this season feels like the next next generation except that its cluttered with a lot of stuff dealing with mistakes and changes left over from the previous showrunners im here because of airiam  lol  i think next season is going to be the real breakthrough in the new era without the baggage of a prior showrunner who had a different direction
1967,startrek,deleted
1968,startrek,&gt;ive always imagined that even moderate lengths of time in the transporter buffer are so incredibly computer-intensive inefficient and riskyi can understand why scanning dematerialization and rematerialization would be computationally expensive but why would storing the resulting data be&gt;with the exception of scottys jury-rigged transporter while it kept him alive for an extremely impressive amount of timetheres another exception in canon the episode of ds9 where they rescued the crew of an exploding ship via transporter and kept them in the stations memory all of it for a few days until repairs were effected so they could be rematerialized
1969,startrek,and then theres straight white dude who oh wait that one doesnt exist at all on this ship
1970,startrek,there are nurses and doctors that would like a word
1971,startrek,that scene with both airiam actors was great and the name drop warmed my soul i’m still salty they killed her off and always will be i think seeing nilsson taking the con and be involved is a nice continuation tho
1972,startrek,yes well if you like the show then god love you i’m certainly not here to shit on anyone’s riff i just really really really am baffled and saddened by that show at the same time i am one of those crazy people who enjoy tng from beginning to end i get a kick out of almost all of it even some of the goofier stuff that show just works for me
1973,startrek,we only learn about a character if we are going to kill them that episode we only learned about nhan this season when she was leaving the show
1974,startrek,finally someone else who remembers farscape i am at the beginning of season 2 currently because i am busy
1975,startrek,&gt;its just a flashy sci-fi show with star trek dressing imo id probably even like it if it wasnt pretending to be star trek but like you trek means something to me and it sucks that this is what we get insteadone really gets the impression that the writers cbs hired have little interest or even familiarity with star trek
1976,startrek,what the hell is with all the condescending im glad you like it but it sucks dudes
1977,startrek,&gt;theres nothing to store for a rainy daybut they did store 9 people rescued via transporter from an exploding ship on a ds9 episode and kept them safely in storage for several days iirc
1978,startrek,i wish at least it would be fun to watch
1979,startrek,
1980,startrek,i forgot that books ship has no name it needs one
1981,startrek,this is interesting and i can kind of half-way buy it they need to hire you on as a script writer
1982,startrek,voyager is my favorite
1983,startrek,\&gt; scottie managed semi successfully to get around the pattern degradation by putting the transporter into a diagnostic mode and continuously cycling his and the other guys patterns back through the buffer on a loop it was a desperate act of someone in a nothing to lose situation and not something anyone would want to risk doing in a normal situation   in ds9 they did this for 9 people without scottys help they were able to manifest virtually in the holodeck but to do that their patterns had to be in long duration storage a couple of days iirc
1984,startrek,i believe the remastered versions are the default streaming versions for tos and tng
1985,startrek,just as bad he wrote mysteries without a resolution in mind sometimes  so some just kind of get abandoned because he didn’t what to do  the tardis explosion is a great example of thatat least disco so far seems to have resolutions and go character development for its mysteries
1986,startrek,i can assure you that your age has nothing to do with it this show is just a triumph of low quality writing
1987,startrek,can you give some examples of things you would noted and sent back genuinely curious about your thoughts given your experience
1988,startrek,oops maybe i’m wrong according to fandom it’s 8000 cubic light years
1989,startrek,sure
1990,startrek,&gt; hell even battlestar galactica was full of terrible people making terrible decisions and living with the consequences gaius baltar was literally the cause of the apocalypse and he got elected president
1991,startrek,if you don’t mind sharing - how would one go about getting into that kind of work sounds fascinating
1992,startrek,for me before watching dis and pic i didnt have to find the good in star trek it was pretty clearly there if it seems like a lot of people arent finding it in this new trek i dont think you should blame themive seen a few posts about people criticizing the same aspects of dis and to me that simply means that a **lot** of people feel the same way also a way i happen to feel if you dont feel the same way ignore iti feel the same way you do right now whenever i see people talking about how amazing dis and to a lesser extent ld is im glad im seeing a decent amount of people who have the same criticisms as me because it makes me feel less alone in the community
1993,startrek,odo and all the other founders should have been able to effectively transform into a literally infinite number of starships of any design they can get their hands on
1994,startrek,how does it not kill them if they are reduced to a blob of energy we arent only matter or energy we are a particular way to organize those things the pattern is you not the materials even if they are converted to energy for transmission you die if your atoms are taken apart and converted to energy even if that same energy is later converted back into matter and reassembled it is functionally exactly the same as just reassembling you based on that pattern using stored elemental feedstock or ambient matter at the other end
1995,startrek,i turned it off when saru promoted the intern ensign to #1  fucking shit show
1996,startrek,ent covered it quickly  trip was miffed when archer made him answer a poop question from a kid back on earth
1997,startrek,way to go rom
1998,startrek,oh and somehow your comment was hidden criticism is not particularly welcome around here it seems
1999,startrek,my favorite video game of all time is birth of the federation think 4x meets star trek so fun and replayable with all the mods google birth of the federation all in one installer and have hours of fun but lets get real here you are going to watch them all again right
2000,starwars,pretty sure none of that is real
2001,starwars,a bold one you are may i ask why
2002,starwars,i actually like the sequel trilogy better than the prequel trilogy
2003,starwars,how much would you compare light saber duels to fencing
2004,starwars,funny enough rots is my favourite film
2005,starwars,it shall be done my lord
2006,starwars,yeah i guess its simply a matter of our interpretation of that scene
2007,starwars,what happens when god falls over *can* god fall over falling over implies failing to stand up can god fail
2008,starwars,apparently not welcome to the sw fandom
2009,starwars,it makes logical sense but only with the explanations not showing such important things about charackter development is just bad storytelling also from episode 8 onward a major intent wasnt to make a good narrative but to fuck up everything the movie before it established especially tlj following tfaif it all makes sense for you this way it is ok i mean i myself think for example not hinting how batman came back to gotham in dkr is bad too but i can live with that in dkr it is just some plot point though in the sequel triogy it is an important part of the story that has to be interpretedmy interpretation is that lukes situation in rotj was much much worse and he still came out on top and not stood on the good side himself but also saved another one and took him back rom the dark side in the sequel trilogy he should even be stronger in his connection to the light side but they ignored that just for shock value or whatever i dont know they werent interested in making a coherent new trilogy at alli can accept flaws like this one if the whole thing would be a well made trilogy but the only good things are the designs production values and some of the actors so it is more me looking at the sequel trilogy as a pile of crap that is still genunely fun to look at as long as the camera isnt zoomed all the way on reys face showing the same trembling emotion every time as much emotion as that papercraft of a character can haveif someone has to explain something like that in a movie that isnt meant to be a thinking mans movie it just is a flaw pretty much every movie has flaws but the sequel trilogy is almost nothing but flaws only held together by the brand name and amazing adiovisualsmaybe i am not the right person to talk to here because maybe it is more meant to be like hey i have an idea how this coud work out kinda thread where my response would be more fitting for a you all dont realize how good the sequels really are thread so i apologize for that
2010,starwars,chuckles warmly and playfully as he electrocutes you to death
2011,starwars,a real star wars fan would by this and it keeps you looking cool for owning it
2012,starwars,i dont get that from it personally he just seems wistful over hearing the name obi-wan
2013,starwars,i really dont want to see the show revived for a third time let it rest all the stories you name can be told elsewhere
2014,starwars,alcohol and drugs are a different argument because some people are more subject to addiction than others i drink quite frequently i am aware of this fact but it doesnt have a hold over me to the point of self destruction when it comes to emotions the solution is often feeling them as opposed to simply experiencing them someone who constantly experiences fear will fall prey to it very quickly where those who truly feel it learn how to master it in a more constructive manner dookus hate towards the jedi was petty at best; right up there with someone swapping political alliance and in fact that was his literal motivation - politics
2015,starwars,who would buy this this desk fan doesnt look like its  keeping *anything* cool in the summer
2016,starwars,i really wish they hadn’t made it into a kids show i couldn’t take any if it seriously it’s just a cliche heroic animated show that stakes its reputation through big characters like darth vader even though they don’t behave or act like live action
2017,starwars,😉😉👍
2018,starwars,heh anakin was both in and out
2019,starwars,even says the true story of baby yoda id buy this just watch it burn like you my brother anakin ahaha
2020,starwars,no problem you put a lot of hard work into this and you deserve all the thanks you can get
2021,starwars,boba hasnt appeared in any post-rotj content in canon until mando but him being in mando doesnt invalidate any pre-rotj canon contentlegends is everything released before 2014 aside from the six films and *the clone wars* its nothing to do with being invalidated by the prequels
2022,starwars,they still recognized him as a previous jedi master but obi-wans reaction in anh doesnt fit imo he looked as he was surprised like he was not recognized in 20 years not just 5
2023,starwars,thank you 👍
2024,starwars,yea pt haters had similar anecdotes and stats back in the day every reason in the book for why any kids they knew hated the prequels and vastly preferred the ot and eu and yet here we are
2025,starwars,i think its just her singing a song
2026,starwars,i would’ve saidwho the fuck is grogu
2027,starwars,isn’t that was the new bad batch show basically is
2028,starwars,its not the storm troopers fault they have bad helmet designs
2029,starwars,itd look like that bit in wallace &amp; gromit
2030,starwars,than you are short sighted fool i do not mean to be rude but i have to ask how much mind bending and mental gymnastics are gonna be required next time vader outright says: the circle is now complete when i left you i was but a lerner now i am the master with ben kenobi awnsering: only a master of evil darthi am pretty sure that this means the last time they met was when anakin ceased to be jedi eg mustafar with the context of the prequels
2031,starwars,god that is beautiful kudos to you
2032,starwars,i remember at one point there was a padawan spin-off rumored  yes i wish they could’ve done more asaaj/quinlan arc maul escape/ruling mandalore
2033,starwars,**gonk**
2034,starwars,oy when vader showed up in fallen order i was so gassed
2035,starwars,*sad gonk*
2036,starwars,where do u live i’ll be there
2037,starwars,i usually just feint and disengage in order to see what the opponent will do when i actually attack its not a perfect strategy but it works well enough
2038,starwars,i do have the deah sentence on 12 systems
2039,starwars,people really fucking stretch to defend those movies
2040,starwars,he lookin a little blazed lol
2041,starwars,that looks great
2042,starwars,is this the tic tac video the navy released
2043,starwars,i dont think it came out
2044,starwars,thank you
2045,starwars,they included the mandalorian but not the prequels the complete guide loledit: that without mentioning all the animations
2046,starwars,9 was very choppy
2047,starwars,interesting how 9 is above 8/7
2048,starwars,i dunno she didnt do a barrel roll from prone as she flew like a human lightsaber-tipped bullet towards an opponent so it was kind of out of left field
2049,starwars,i’m very excited for mando s3 and tbobf
2050,starwars,id like to see the whos line is it anyways star wars parody for sure
2051,starwars,i didnt get ac vibes from it but its a great game nonetheless
2052,starwars,so he never appeared in any sort of media aside from clone wars until mandoi know certain things he was in became legends because of the prequels but aside from that he was never in anything
2053,starwars,tlj easily rogue one tcw season 7 rebels battlefront ii fallen order galaxy’s edge and mando are also highlights there’s a lot to like
2054,starwars,hey thats a rifftrax line
2055,starwars,based on the comments this has generated im not the one that appears to be upset
2056,starwars,the mgs track makes it 10x better
2057,starwars,youtinicom
2058,starwars,i think the last jedi gets alot of undeserved shit its my favorite of the sequel trilogy mandalorian is probably my favorite since disney era
2059,starwars,how do you mean theres not anything about boba after rotj in canon mandos the first thing
2060,starwars,the resistance march
2061,starwars,jack shit is what it’s sad to see star wars being driven more by acceptability and profit rather than imagination and creativity
2062,starwars,for some people liking something others dont isnt enough they have to try and make it seem as though the people who dont like it are dumb and just dont get it thats why we get videos like this
2063,starwars,same here holdo is just a military stooge move along people shes the least of this movies woes
2064,starwars,i felt that it did get better as it went yes although i didnt think the first one was particularly bad so maybe we just have different tastes also itd be important to note i used the audiobook which is a somewhat different experience there were voices and sound effects and music even
2065,starwars,
2066,starwars,especially him not going by ben at all in the prequels and even being called obi-wan by padmé *after* the kids are bornbut to be fair to *rebels* ezra clearly has no idea whats going on and what hes talking about and maul thinks obi-wans fallen far from his previous status as a jedi master and just considers him a rat in the desert
2067,starwars,goddamit cant some fans just enjoy what they have
2068,starwars,yeah bud you’re gonna have to wait until it’s out
2069,starwars,not sure but i wonder this as well it feels like were in a weird sport with star wars at the moment because of the new movies and shows that have been and are coming out i think about this when it comes to boba also does his being in the mandalorian erase everything involving him after return
2070,starwars,yep i feel like this series could show us exactly *how* obi-wan transitions from the prequel war hero to the silent guardian of *rebels* and anh
2071,starwars,worse there is no glow of the engines its coming right at you
2072,starwars,nope it was fine as is
2073,starwars,what was photoshop used for here
2074,starwars,i also feel the i havent gone by the name of obi-wan since oh before you were born has been retconned as well not just in rots but also in rebels i mean yes maul and ezra didnt say the name obi-wan but they did recognize him as the jedi master and that felt like a retcon to me since bens line in anh felt like he wasnt recognized as a jedi and not simply not being called by his name
2075,starwars,thanks
2076,starwars,wtf is the point in making this shit up i dont get it probably why i believed it lol just sad really
2077,starwars,the colour is the same as the death star laser clever
2078,starwars,we dont know yet but theres about 7 years between them
2079,starwars,the colors are heavily inspired by the northern lightsfeel free to follow me on instagram at matthewmadethis :&amp;#x200b;**disclaimer**: i did this as a practice this piece was **heavily** inspired by artist nicolas tetreault-abelheres a link to the reference: check him out he makes fantaaaastic stuff
2080,starwars,that’s sick
2081,starwars,to each their own and saying you just think it looks cool is a better justification for liking it than the ridiculous explanation this video tries to make up for it
2082,starwars,we had a funeral for a mynock
2083,starwars,lol i remember when people were unironically speculating that rey was hans kid after cheating on leia theyre not together in tfa and han seems to recognize rey -&gt; its so obvious
2084,starwars,+1 for thrawn both old and new i absolutely love his stories did aftermath get better i could barely get past the first book and found it to be terribly written
2085,starwars,i guess there’s less elegant ways to say “shut up”
2086,starwars,need some background theme music
2087,starwars,or coming towards you
2088,starwars,yes you are right as palpatine names him vader after mace - but for me anakin is always still there as shown at the end of rotj 👍
2089,starwars,sure if you just ignore that those scenes are deliberately made to mirror each other 🤷‍♀️
2090,starwars,&gt; ooc for obi-wan to ever leave tatoienne during his exilewhythe coup just happened luke is safe there may be other jedi in need of helpit would be 100% in character for obi wan to go alone and try to fix things thats what hes done most of the prequels
2091,starwars,i just think the visuals and sound of the sabers are cool af
2092,starwars,love tge color scheme
2093,starwars,awesome your one of us but you must now fight the trials of the sith either choose revin or nahilous think thats how to spell them but im prob wrong
2094,starwars,
2095,starwars,
2096,starwars,my dads tattoo artist has a life sized stormtrooper in his work place and it’s awesome
2097,starwars,haha bless you it is a good tuneahhhh ok makes sense thanks
2098,starwars,very very nice
2099,starwars,even though your comment wasn’t directed at me thank you for the urging to enjoy the journey and not feel the need to rush or binge to catch up i have such love for sw but my ability to keep up over the last decade has left me far behind
2100,starwars,perfect eyes it is like you see all these terrible things that happened to her from those eyes
2101,starwars,
2102,starwars,the explanation is shit because the move they are doing is not a circle parry its a flourishthere is no good explanation for the shot which is why so many people criticize it
2103,starwars,i gratefully take it - thanks 👍
2104,starwars,his most obvious divergence from them is his lack of force powerssecond is his motives are alien but not evil he sees a threat to the galaxy and is intent on making moves to secure the galaxy against that threatfinally his intelligence it’s like if sherlock holmes was the villain
2105,starwars,in the end dooku was blinded by his hatred of the jedi so that he couldn’t see the betrayal of sidiousthat is what hatred does to you it is like a drug alcoholics never say “i don’t drink” they say i haven’t drank in x amount of time because it is a daily struggle to let go of something so powerful
2106,starwars,i personally feel it’s ooc for obi-wan to ever leave tatoienne during his exile though i guess i should wait and see
2107,starwars,that wouldve been a great moment
2108,starwars,yeah the set came out earlier in the year with them in but it’s super popular and goes on back order all the time 👍
2109,starwars,time for grogus first ink
2110,starwars,yarael actually got a couple of lines but yes they are mostly background in light of the jedi and into the dark maybe we will know more in the next novels
2111,starwars,good idea
2112,starwars,&gt; what she did to his creation she doesnt actually write or direct anything shes not the only person who works at lucasfilmthe new eu is much more cohesive and the books comics and video game storytelling are overall of a much higher quality than beforeinstead of making wild assumptions about the personalities and feelings of people you dont know you should enjoy the parts you enjoy and not interact with the stuff you dislikeand i encourage you to leave the wild speculation rumor chain and hatefilled echochambers that exist within this fandom and instead put your energy in new conent that you *do* enjoy
2113,starwars,just to be a little nitpicky the scene with dooku is the only one with anakin when he kills windu he kills anakin and only darth vader remains
2114,starwars,i have 36 templates so far and some great feedback to make these more visually interesting i will be posting them as soon as i make their changes
2115,starwars,i was very shocked i am about halfway through i amnot a big reader so i can’t review it from a technical standpoint but i am enjoying the story i also really like revan path of destruction trilogy and deceived
2116,starwars,dmv photos be like
2117,starwars,why is it shit and do you have a better explanation
2118,starwars,same to you i guess
2119,starwars,i think you didnt watch the link i posted in this edit most of the stuff youre talking about was 
2120,starwars,even the when i left you line has essentially been retconned by aotc and rots i remember fans were fairly surprised to learn anakin would be a full jedi knight in rots since we all assumed he was obi-wans apprentice until he became vader
2121,starwars,lol you’re a trip man have a good life
2122,starwars,r/tihi
2123,starwars,the madlad just walks right by like this is normal although if this is la it probably is
2124,starwars,clones
2125,starwars,kudos  that would take a long time but totally worth it  awesome puzzle
2126,starwars,based post
2127,starwars,they trained by playing asteroids lmao
2128,starwars,ill never be able to watch this because of how thin the lightsabers are it makes me incredibly uncomfortable idk why
2129,starwars,you said the movie solo deals significant damage to one of the payoffs of tlj im just trying to figure out why you think that because i dont think it does
2130,starwars,i totally agree
2131,starwars,the clone wars takes place during the prequels which are before the original trilogy the sequels take place after
2132,starwars,i understand why youre worried and i understand why its a dangerous floodgate as you called it however lets wait and see before making any judgment and tbh if it was a retcon it wouldnt be the first one in star wars and not the first when it comes to obi-wan kenobi imo
2133,starwars,&gt; no it isnt yeah sure luke had some little wrestle with the dark side but still this is fairy tale level white knight luke skywalkerwhat a ‘little wrestle with dark side’ i’m sorry i simply can’t relate with that statement at all we’re talking about the central conflict of the main character of the ot i think that’s disingenuous to call it a ‘little wrestle’&gt; you can explain all that with headanon and whatnot and if it works for you it is great but the sequel trilogy just is very bad storytelling without even really having a storywhat head canon head canon is when you purposefully change the story to met to your satisfaction what op and myself are doing is interpreting what’s the film using support from all the movies to draw conclusions about the messages and emotions of tlj in other words we’re watching a film people have the right to interpret tlj however they want and form their own opinions whether i agree with them or not however i stand by my interpretation and will defend it because i believe it is well supported makes logical sense within the story structure and the saga as a whole and presents a good compelling narrative - which is the obvious intent of the filmmakers
2134,starwars,ehh i didn’t really care for the dice or the sequels it was just my go to example
2135,starwars,i know sidious *intended* to kill him but he jumped headfirst into the deep end of the dark side im thinking more dooku capable of tapping the power without being fully immersed anger is powerful but fleeting unless you simply refuse to let it go which is what a *sith* does but not necessarily other dark side users
2136,starwars,what about the grogu
2137,starwars,
2138,starwars,i mean okay regardless prequels can work fine and *have* worked fine *rebels* too
2139,starwars,the idea that dice were used to win a card game never really worked anyway but the dice are still hans; qira didnt give them to him or anything they maybe symbolize the relationship within the film itself but that doesnt mean thats all theyre for they also outlast that relationship as the final shot of the film shows us
2140,starwars,just an inconvenient fact that would hinder the enjoyment of the joke 😁
2141,starwars,lookin pretty rough but nice
2142,starwars,as mentioned in the mandalorian season 1 gallery episode 1 had the most practical miniatures it took me forever to realize that just because they used green/blue screen doesn’t mean they only use cgi it’s been fun going back specifically with episode 1 and finding stuff i assumed was cg that might actually be practical
2143,starwars,its kind of a relevant point people who dont know much about sword-fighting will point to it and act like it is uniquely the only dubious scene but people familiar with swords or guns are going to notice the sloppy movements all over the place the original video may it be correct that it is more or less meant to be a fantasy flashy version of a real move it doesnt look realistic but very little of the fighting does
2144,starwars,muiltiple words with a sort of no mans sky method of travel between planets would be fun
2145,starwars,but never say it to man
2146,starwars,fuckin amazing
2147,starwars,i think grievous would appreciate that new kind of lightsaber in his collection
2148,starwars,i started that journey last year as well im currently about to start on the darth bane trilogy i have a lot of other books ive been reading as well my hope is to at least get through the end of the clone wars by the end of the year
2149,starwars,it’s pretty good so far it’s 200 years before phantom menace
2150,starwars,ok
2151,starwars,multiple sequences from *the last jedi* luke and yoda kylo and rey fighting the pretorian guard luke on crait the hyperspeed ram i know a lot of people dont like the flick and thats fine im a bit worn out on the arguing but i think there was some fantastic *star wars* in that *star wars*
2152,starwars,
2153,starwars,sometimes i do
2154,starwars,originally the dice supposed to be what solo used to win the falcon but solo officials stated that the dice were a symbol of han’s relationship with i forget her namefrikin have to wait 13 minutes to post this
2155,starwars,not the op he was talking about st vs ot as a whole i thinkm but i said anh hope and tfa are very similar besides visually i see the diffrence visually but not tone plot whatever
2156,starwars,
2157,starwars,i got my preorder for sky walker saga all ready and i can’t wait
2158,starwars,&gt; anestheticsdid you mean aesthetics
2159,starwars,deleted
2160,starwars,oh i haven’t thought of that but it is a planet that is strong with both sides of the force so it would be awesome and a goo place to train him we can only hope
2161,starwars,i just rewatched darths encounter with obi wan in the death star and this is the only quote about their last encounter &gt;“when i left you i was but the learner now i am the master” theres a lot of room for interpretation there we have no idea what obi wan will be doing while luke is still a toddler he might be working in the shadows undermining the empire it might be during those missions that darth is aware of obi wan and something happens to think hes deadtheres still a lot of unresolved stuff between the two that needs to be aired out
2162,starwars,the prequels are also loved by plenty of people these days and *the clone wars* especially also a prequel series is roundly praised for improving on anakins characterization *rogue one* also a prequel is widely praised here
2163,starwars,delicious is not a word id use do describe a drawing
2164,starwars,i was complementing his drawing
2165,starwars,prequel can deal a lot of damage to a story why are the prequels hated so much because they hated how anakin was portrayed
2166,starwars,how does *solo* damage tlj
2167,starwars,you got any stl files this is absolutely amazing
2168,starwars,what 😃
2169,starwars,he does awesome work located in central florida
2170,starwars,unpopular but i prefer rebels to clone wars tight plotting and character arcs for ezra and kanan really helped
2171,starwars,yep youre being too cynical and weve had the major casting announcements for most of the shows before weve seen footage; thats nothing out of the ordinary
2172,starwars,there’s 19 years of him sitting on tatooinehe’s a beloved charactera lot of people want to see what he was going through in that time and the idea of having vader involved is always always always going to bring people to the screen if done right and i trust it will be this could be some of the best star wars we ever get and it could pack a hell of an emotional punch
2173,starwars,disney hasn’t really proven themselves worthy of such trust prequel stories especially have a lot of potential to deal damage the movie solo deals significant damage to one of the payoffs of tlj and that film didn’t need solo’s help to damage its payoffs
2174,starwars,but then again sidious was torturing luke he was going to kill him and that is the way of the dark side if you pull your power from hatred you will not stop at incapacitating your victim again the darkside is not the ability to use force lightning the darkside is to use your worst feelings to become more powerful and bend nature to your will
2175,starwars,i guess i’m being too cynical it’s just that they announced hayden would be in it before we got a second of footage had me worried
2176,starwars,you mean a swkotor movie and/or series
2177,starwars,please make more i really enjoyed looking through these
2178,starwars,his name was never baby yoda
2179,starwars,it’s the same depiction tho
2180,starwars,except the explanation is shit
2181,starwars,wow i hope someone was fired for this blunder
2182,starwars,oh shut up bruh really a retcon as small as “they probably saw each other over the 19 years in between movies” is not the end of the star wars universe truly if they do it right and it really has weight behind it i don’t see an issue
2183,starwars,this mans out here just living his life lol
2184,starwars,im not sure why you think the show has been made for no other purpose than to have obi-wan and vader fight
2185,starwars,its not a circle parry its a flourish
2186,starwars,❤
2187,starwars,obi-wans timeline isnt all that intricate weve got 19 years of mostly blank canvas to explore for himif anything *andor* should be more of a worry since itll probably mess up the history of the rebellion along the way
2188,starwars,i can see the pixels jk
2189,starwars,look at mr painfully original over here
2190,starwars,&gt;i guess making a show for the sole purpose of a fight we know neither side can win doesnt sit right with me i feel shows need a reason beyond spectacle and money
2191,starwars,ok thanks anyway i was just wondering if the book gave any clue about the canon ages of oppo and yarael or simply namedroped them without going into details it seems for now theyre just background characters hopefully theyll be developped a little bit more in the books to come 
2192,starwars,a i’m pretty sure their ‘encounter’ is gonna be either a flashback to parts of the mustafar fight we didn’t see in rots a dream sequence or a vision  b your other point doesn’t even make any sense because that would be dumb yeah; but it wouldn’t fly in the face of the entire st let’s say that han wasn’t bens biological father so what ben wouldn’t know that and neither would han so they still see each other as father and son making what happens in the movie exactly the same also leia is simply above cheating so that wouldn’t happen anyway
2193,starwars,id recommend either saberforge or ultrasaber you can customize to your liking and still keep it a relatively cheap build
2194,starwars,this always fucks with my head when someone does this to me while fencing
2195,starwars,i think it’s due to drop in march my friend
2196,starwars,im not suggesting that no but im glad you agree that its a bit silly to speculate so wildly based purely on seeing the same number used in two entirely different contexts
2197,starwars,he was talking specifically about anh v tfa i think  instead of a last ditch effort to blow up the deathstar that people think is hopeless we get han solo “yeah let’s just go blow it up ez”han dealing with 4 tie fighters vs poe blowing up a dozen in like 6 secondsi could go on but i think the point is made
2198,starwars,sure except that he trusted her and she betrayed him     he didn’t even attend the ep9 premiere which is a huge dis pretty sure he hates kathleen kennedy for what she did to his creation
2199,starwars,im not saying to cease production on star wars shows im just saying dont focus on characters who already have a very intracet timeline kenobi is literally the only star wars show i take issue with
2200,starwars,the quote: “when i left you i was but the learner now i am the master” is vagueyes it could apply to mustafar in rots but who knows it could also apply to whatever happens in kenobithey could also play it super safe and have obi-wan and vader fighting as some sort of ptsd dream sequence that obi-wan has that ends in vader “killing” him
2201,starwars,love this
2202,starwars,and that kids is what happens when you full send through hyperspace without doing the calculations
2203,starwars,thanks
2204,starwars,all of them but the front two on the right are made from cardboard the other two are made from foam that would be wicked to have a fully functional helmet with all the corresponding equipment
2205,starwars,whys it dangerous though what does it matter if they have some sort of confrontation again especially if it ends up working welland weve basically had everything *but* the actual moment of conception in the *aftermath* trilogy so its pretty safe to say ben is hans son
2206,starwars,i know im getting downvoted but so much of rebels was useless the amount of times they break into an impereal base and dress up as clone troopers is absurd sure the clone was had two bad seasons but rebels has three and there are so many episodes that add nothing
2207,starwars,immaculate ❤️❤️
2208,starwars,yup not a golfer          also if you’re suggesting anakin and grogu are the same age because grogu is the “real” chosen one i don’t know what to tell you except “we’ll see”
2209,starwars,oh i learn something new everytime i upload to this subreddit i used a reference photo but i think his ear was too dark to see it
2210,starwars,oh man just chill  your reasoning to protect star wars is not to make anymore star wars  which is like asking a musician to stop making music because you liked their first album so much 
2211,starwars,&gt;hes a great tactician so great that zhan couldnt write a satisfying ending for his trilogy so he used a deus ex machina to end the series then brought that mf back like palpatine in tros several times i cant see how its a deus ex machina since the entire plot line is set up throughout the trilogy with leia and the noghriand no zahn didnt bring thrawn back to life at all i dont think youve read the hand of thrawn duology if you think he didand personally while im not the biggest fan of thrawn i certainly dont see it as a case of nostalgia he was genuinely an interesting character in his trilogy; thats what i felt when i first read it circa 95-96 and there was *plenty* of star wars around by then
2212,starwars,ill have to watch solo again
2213,starwars,true i get so inspired when the robot and big dumb guy fight over stupid shit and then the “quirky” mandalorian lady says something witty truly a masterpiece of cinema
2214,starwars,unrelated does she do good work
2215,starwars,maybe you could do those silver  because they are neither really good or bad
2216,starwars,oh and not 1 nod to prequels seems well thought out if you ask me lol this is why i dont buy these half ass magazines from companies that barely know the whole story
2217,starwars,ill consider that thank you :d
2218,starwars,he ignited his sabre that shows intent
2219,starwars,yeah im sure they do so is dooku and grevious and tarkin and maul and mallus in fact theyre better characters and villains but why arent they held in the same esteem as thrawn nostalgia100% the reason theyre saying hes so great is because they were introduced to him very early and he was the only new star wars in 10 years it wasnt like today were as soon as one movie ended another project was announced rotj ended and there was nothing for years until these books when your starving for a decade anything is gonna be good in your eyes people hate on tpm but that movie made an insane amount of money and your imagination cant have bad acting so a book cant let you down the way a actors poor acting ability or a directors personal choices can its not a crime to like him but you should know 90% of his popularity stems from nostalgia in time where offical star wars content was scarce not because hes a compelling character
2220,starwars,what poes the one in this image
2221,starwars,his name has been cannonized as of tros but we dont know anything beyond a sith lord named revan existed
2222,starwars,deleted
2223,starwars,this is awesome you should sell prints😁
2224,starwars,molten salt: a star wars story
2225,starwars,this we don’t know
2226,starwars,if a person on the internet
2227,starwars,diddled yaddle i havepulled out on time i have not
2228,starwars,fat thor is a great comparison well all still loved him even though hed changed its a shame theres still such a stigma around mental health luke has clearly suffered a tremendous amount and its only natural that his outlook on life has changed its nice to have flawless heroes but flawed heroes that we can all relate to are even better whats important is that luke *didnt* give up in the end - he sacrificed himself for the resistance gave them time to escape and inspired the galaxy i think it was wonderful storytelling
2229,starwars,are you talking about the one that’s not out yet
2230,starwars,
2231,starwars,and do we know if he was already an old master or was he a relatively newcomer to the council 
2232,starwars,the narrative of kathleen secretly hating star wars makes no sense if you stop to think about it for a secondshes been working with lucasfilm since indiana jones and the temple of doomshe was georges collaborator for a long time and he hand-picked her to take over lucasfilmshe wasnt appointed by disney she was a top lucasfilm employee who got promotedshe has the same involvement with the mandalorian rogue one and solo as with the sequel trilogyfurthermore the eu was never canon the way that people claim george was notoriously dismissive of the expanded universe and did not consider them to be canonical with his movies
2233,starwars,you didnt hear decapitated whole big thing
2234,starwars,and im saying youre just speculating kathleen mentioning 50-somethings *50-somethings* bear in mind not 50-year-olds and a character being 50 years old really isnt the slam-dunk you think it isand yes there are a lot of numbers it doesnt mean theyre all related and if you want to relate grogus age to something maybe speculate about it makes him the same age as anakin another powerful force-user
2235,starwars,also there’s a bit less impressive 
2236,starwars,if i personally was given the choice id make all of star wars more mature but at the same time i dont like the too adult things that are filled with sex and gore however thats not my point my point is being aimed at kids is just pointing out the target audience liking it or not is a matter of personal preference but some people both fans and non fans of these shows treat this term as an insult and that is what i dont quite understand
2237,starwars,this was a delight to see this morning i love pokemon and have been following james turner since sword and shield came out and have become a bit of a fan of his other work especially his kirby art so this was nice
2238,starwars,this detail is amazing but i love it
2239,starwars,thank you for letting me know who the creator was i couldnt find out who had made it when i found this as a wallpaper on someones phone and recreated it from a screenshot i particularly had to work on the jaw and the cheeks for hours together because i felt something was off with it
2240,starwars,i get why you can’t do the younglings but attacking windu always seemed super dark to me
2241,starwars,no it’s how she is saying mando
2242,starwars,
2243,starwars,in the big lebowski someone looks at a bowling ball and says what is this and lebowski responds clearly you’re not a golfer i’m trying to say that the writing is on the wall and you are choosing not to see it there’s a lot of numbers he didn’t have to make baby yoda 50 he chose 50 as a slight to kennedy
2244,starwars,this is so neat 😍
2245,starwars,rebel scum*
2246,starwars,i mean i don’t recall the set up for it
2247,starwars,i have been rewatching rebels and besides the movies this show invokes so much more feelings than like any other thing in star wars ahsoka and rex reunion ahsoka vs vader jedi night just wow as an adult i started to tear up i tell my friends that like star wars to watch this because it is definitely not just a kids show
2248,starwars,im glad you did tbh im not a huge fan of the prequels either and on rethinking it 7 and 9 come before 1 and 2 for me it moves aroundbut for me 8 stays last just my opinioni would recommend looking at the clone wars and rebels they seem like kids shows and in the beginning rebels really was - its great in seasons 3 and 4 but they have great character development deep and involving storylines and tie into mando a lotand that season 2 ending for mando wow cant wait for the book of boba fett and season 3
2249,starwars,you might be minutes away from being frozen in carbonite
2250,starwars,definitely love the scenes you made
2251,starwars,she-on
2252,starwars,oh boy do i have a lot to catch up on
2253,starwars,&gt;why don’t you just acknowledge that i have an interesting pointwhy would iand no im not a golfer youre gonna have to explain that one
2254,starwars,same
2255,starwars,i’m not saying it’s impossible to criticise a man for his appearance i’m saying it doesn’t happen as much particularly in star wars and particularly not along the lines of “how can we take them seriously when they wear a dress and have purple hair” so instead of resorting to the classic bad faith argument “well you made it about gender” why don’t you listen to what i’m telling you: this is a classic misogynistic trope it has happened for decades it’s tired and we should do better you think you’re looking at her “as a person not a woman” but you give yourself too much credit anytime someone brings in her purple hair or the way she dresses they’re relying on classic stereotypes against women that they can’t be taken seriously unless they present as more masculine the issue is there people have pointed out it’s there for three years now but because you don’t see the issue you don’t think it’s there i hate to break it to you but the sexism is there whether you see it or not
2256,starwars,that’s true probably only a very select few people knew what was going to happen
2257,starwars,for sure - a few people have said that too i just couldn’t build it - i have the temlple march that leads to it though 👍
2258,starwars,aside from the head wound that probs shoulf have been fatal in the time depicted
2259,starwars,clearly you’re not a golfer           as i chew the food for you what i’m saying is favreau decided to make baby yoda 50 as a direct response to kennedy‘s comment you see because kennedy commented that only 50-year-olds care about the original trilogy so i’m saying jon favreau made baby yoda 50 for that reason so basically baby yoda could’ve been any age like five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 but no baby yoda is 50 and i think this is where you’re getting lost the reason he chose that number is because kathleen kennedy made that comment about 50-year-olds caring about the original trilogy you see kathleen kennedy didn’t think anyone under 50 would care about the original trilogy and jon favreau disagreed with that so he decided to write a show about a 50-year-old baby yoda that gets rescued by the hero of the original trilogy maybe that’s too hard to you know what i’ll keep going baby yoda is 50 kathleen kennedy said
2260,starwars,i dont feel like lukes character really did take any major left turns or anything  he seemed like the same character to me just that hed been through some shit anakin was such a let-down because this supposedly legendary warrior and good friend turned out to be an annoying kid at first and then an annoying teenager/20-something charisma vacuum but thats another conversation for another day really
2261,starwars,nope since you edited it in 3 minutes after i replied&gt; “do we want to build a tatooine and build what all of the fiftysomethings remember star wars as or do we want to build something else which is going to appeal to all the upcoming generations who are going to know the new stories” &gt;and then baby yoda shows up and he’s 50 not 40 not 60 50 righto and wheres your proof those two things are related&gt;and just like episode seven starts with the words “this will begin to make things right” the mandalorian features characters repeatedly saying “this is the way” same as ryan johnson with that “let the pass die” nonsense this is called codingno its called speculation
2262,starwars,there have been 2 or 3 continuities for decades in sw even lucas acknowledged that there was at least one parallel universethere are at least 2 distinct concepts for the st and the abrams/kasdan/johnson scripts got produced while the lucas treatments did not get developedat this point what would be the downside of developing another continuity that would fit with the st and another parallel universe as well
2263,starwars,i’m going out on a limb and say his darkest moment was when he killed the younglings
2264,starwars,when will you learn your ludicrous arguments mean nothing at all this its fiction and its ongoing
2265,starwars,i just posted a quote from kennedy implying only 50 year olds care about ot star wars you didn’t see that             why don’t you just acknowledge that i have an interesting point
2266,starwars,the vader one looks very believable too
2267,starwars,nah id rather they composed a distinct theme for the new republic maybe just inspired by both the resistance march and the rebel fanfare
2268,starwars,everyone can do it with enough practice :d
2269,starwars,thank you it was a lot of fun to design :
2270,starwars,not quite haha its actually just a tiny piercing in his from this perspective right ear
2271,starwars,that makes me so happy to hear thank you &lt;3
2272,starwars,before battle of yavin
2273,starwars,👍 yeah that is a good scene and another important one for anakin- but it simply came down to space on the end though i am building outer things and will cover that one off at some point 👍
2274,starwars,its indicating how shes speaking; with a sing-song voice
2275,starwars,what is bby
2276,starwars,its in a canon novel *dark disciple* as wookieepedia cites
2277,starwars,i love it this is one of the coolest arts ive seen on here
2278,starwars,and i take it you dont know who phil szostak is then&gt;entire intention of the series was a response to kathleen kennedy’s comments about 50 year old star wars fans being the only ones who care about luke skywalker so favreau wrote a story about 50 year old who is rescued by luke it’s a direct correlation “this is the way” implies the same thing as “this will begin to make things right” the first line of episode 7 it’s signalingsource
2279,starwars,thank you im happy with how it turned out :
2280,starwars,favorite part btw is dookus head and hands on the ground 😁😆😄😅😄😅
2281,starwars,thanks for the clarification
2282,starwars,thanks :
2283,starwars,the separatists would have won it was largely a war of attrition the clone army of the republic was far more expensive than the separatist droid army also the war kept getting harder each year as more and more jedi had fallen sidious also stopped the separatists from creating many powerful weapons or limited them a lot if sidious hadnt controlled the separatists then the republic would have had no chance to win
2284,starwars,thanks for the clarification
2285,starwars,somebody needs a snickers
2286,starwars,question why did you go with dooku over windus scene either way this is awesome though
2287,starwars,thanks for the clarification
2288,starwars,wow danny captured her perfectly especially her eyes beautiful work
2289,starwars,thanks for the clarification
2290,starwars,and another is in prison
2291,starwars,dont know shit about art but you posses a power i can only dream of
2292,starwars, what about the droid attack on the wookies
2293,starwars,hahaha big gold hoop
2294,starwars,it’s the march on the jedi temple where they go on to slaughter the jedi’s and the younglings 👍👍
2295,starwars,wow you captured her perfectly especially her eyes beautiful work
2296,starwars,i see
2297,starwars,deleted
2298,starwars,looks like it belongs in the end credits of the show well done :
2299,starwars,i totally agree that there are too many coming back from the dead im ok with the force ghost concept but apart from that - not so much when that is said mace windu probably was the one with most chance to survive his own portrayed death theoretically he could have landed in a bypassing speeder when he fell out the window that doesnt mean i want them to bring him back though assuming that maul survived being cut in two and then falling down the reactor shaft seemed extremely unlikely palpatine surviving his trip down the shaft slightly  less unlikely since he after all was in one piece and the most powerful sith lord and im not too impressed by boba fett surviving the sarlacc eitheri really did like maces character in the prequels butlet him stay there
2300,starwars,
2301,starwars,he is from the old republic era around 4000 bby
2302,starwars,much drama such wow gj
2303,starwars,same - can’t wait 👍
2304,starwars,yes he does i would recommend playing through sw: kotor and read the book revan idk author sorry you can also play kotor 2 for more insight though he is not the main focus afterwards play the mmo the old republic for his story completion
2305,starwars,she’s singing it lol
2306,starwars,its implied with the march on the temple we all know what happens youre good man
2307,starwars,
2308,starwars,i cant really see that meaning anything you said plos one of the few not to have their voice in tros; thats nowhere near true
2309,starwars,thanks so much this is a gift but maybe i should paint more to sell haha
2310,starwars,
2311,starwars,ventless died in the canon novel *dark disciple* which roughly follows the plot of the un-made cw episode
2312,starwars,looks better than anything i could make keep up the good work
2313,starwars,probably because rebels was released in chronological order whereas the first episode of the clone wars is in the middle of an arc which isn’t continued until season 3 kind of a weird decision there
2314,starwars,
2315,starwars,he is not in canon he is only in legends/extended universe he lived nearly 4000 years before the events of episode 4
2316,starwars,omg 😮
2317,starwars,&gt; lucas said continuity is for wimps source googles your friend&gt;entire intention of the series was a response to kathleen kennedy’s comments about 50 year old star wars fans being the only ones who care about luke skywalker so favreau wrote a story about 50 year old who is rescued by luke it’s a direct correlation “this is the way” implies the same thing as “this will begin to make things right” the first line of episode 7 it’s signalingsource
2318,starwars,was waiting for the lightsaber comment lol it’s certainly different but generally i thought it was alright except yoda there’s no forgiving how weird he looked
2319,starwars,and i said if thats what you want to criticize the st for its a weak criticismtheres plenty of other shit to complain aboutbut bitching about long gaps between episodes/trilogies is both disingenuous and ignores how that has been done since the beginningstar wars has been told from a non-linear perspective for decades
2320,starwars,i just want a sandbox open-world star wars game that either takes place during the clone wars or takes place from clone wars and goes all the way to the yuuzhan vong wars
2321,starwars,so the shows just have to go on long enough we almost had poes dad in the mandalorian so its pretty obvious which direction they will be going with these sequel shows
2322,starwars,i dont miss facebook holy f
2323,starwars,delicious
2324,starwars,i thought that was gone with the blastwave
2325,starwars,sure but as an adult im more likely to be intrigued by something thats aimed at a somewhat more mature audience like mando as opposed to a straight up kids cartoonif given the choice id much rather have had rebels not be a kids showso yeah it being a cartoon isnt outright bad at all but its not exactly helping to make it any more likeable for older fans
2326,starwars,because youre so fixated on her being a woman when im just looking at her as a personyoure enforcing gender roles because youre saying its misogynistic that people are criticizing her clothes and hair meaning that you tie those attributes to a single gender youre the only one here obsessed with gender/sex and creating an issue that isnt there&gt; do you think she looks stupid thenbecause i just think it does i dont need a reason lol just like i dont have to have a reason to not like a pair of shoes just not my thing i dont think it looked good&gt;the woman admiral should be allowed to dress and look however she wantsim not saying she shouldnt be just that it looks stupid nothing sexist/misogynistic about that you just desperately want it to be for some weird reason
2327,starwars,what specifically is the first scene with the clones behind him i’m struggling to remember
2328,starwars,ohh hopefully seems like r2 remembered grogu at the end of mando although i don’t speak droid maybe they have a history  i’m so excited for the new series
2329,starwars,thank you absolutely was coming here to comment about crediting danny as its not ops original artwork as is implied in the titleabsolutely love his style i met him at last years star wars celebration in chicago when my wife and i bought that print and he is an incredibly nice guy and very humble im glad to see him getting some serious recognition being able to do the collectible pin designs for this years celebration even if it never actually happenedhe seems to have a friendship/working relationship with ashley eckstein now and his art shows up in the heruniverse store which my wife half-jokes she started as she got that print signed by ashley and she couldnt get over how gorgeous the artwork was and didnt seem to know danny at the time
2330,starwars,this looks film quality at least in this picture your clone is very impressive you must be very proud
2331,starwars,there’s been so much discussed about kathleen kennedy it’s impossible for me to remember each time i heard that 50 year old comment repeated i do recall it being about the entire ot the location and the characters kennedy had no respect or regard for any of the older star wars removing the eu and not reuniting the cast were to me vindictive actions            but her dislike of the original trilogy dismissing it as something for 50 year olds coupled with the fact that baby yoda is 50 and rescued by luke “this is the way” it seems apparent to me what’s going on behind the scenes            kennedy’s influence is waning and iger is favoring favreau
2332,starwars,
2333,starwars,sorry the thesis for this conversation had already been established:  anakin should be held accountable for the violence he perpetratedyour essay reads like a meninist manifesto justifying abuses of power and acts of violence  it’s pretty cringe that you’re using sex drive as an example for the claim “no one is truly guilty everyone is innocent”  i wonder what kind of things you are willing to overlook because someone can’t overcome their desiresit’s pretty established that our genetics and upbringing have a major impact on our behavior  yet if we use these things as a justification for behavior that is predestined why not start preventing it by labeling people as likely to commit acts  would the council have been justified in executing a young anakin if they were able to sense what he was going to do  this steps into ideas of pre-crime prosecution  anyone coming from an abusive household should be locked up because they are the most likely to continue the cyclein this thread we have two kinds of people  one kind seeks to justify actions by saying that the perpetrator had an excuse and their horrible actions are excusable  the other says that no matter how awful of a life someone leads they still have the ability to be a good person  we the latter learned this from the very circumstances you say we are enslaved to  we overcame  that is true strength and power  the former is weakness of character and fortitudei know i won’t convince you otherwise  you might never see the merits of accountability in your lifetime  you will probably go on excusing your poor decisions as a product of your own biology and upbringing  you’ll just go through life as a slave to it as opposed to master of your own destiny  interesting  i imagine this is akin to a conversation that would take place between a jedi and a sith  just a reminder the sith are the bad guys
2334,starwars,no she’s saying “mando” with a sing-song type of voice
2335,starwars,unless something comes out to change things  dark disciple is canon and av is dead
2336,starwars,have you seen what a star fighter can do with a well placed shot its not that impressive the bombers were slow as all hell they were easy targets for aa and fighters even with fighter support and they didnt have weapons poes start was really good too he distracted first order command then took out many cannons and left the order open for attack if the rebellion had been using proper bombers they wouldve gone fast and low dropped enough missiles to blow the thing to hell and flown out of there before fighters arrived but the bombers they picked were to slow
2337,starwars,that shit is clean bet this one sells easy
2338,starwars,star wars is star wars
2339,starwars,you are misremembering or misinterpreting the visit to the hut to probe bens mind starts  just as an investigation - luke is troubled but hardly homicidal the second part starts when he looks inside and sees horror only then does the instinct to kill well up for as luke says the briefest moment and just as soon as it appears it vanishes the thought of killing does not start with luke alone in his hut it clearly starts with his probingluke says for the briefest moment you say premeditated i say these two things contradict each other i believe lukes account
2340,starwars,
2341,starwars,yes the script was adapted into a novel
2342,starwars,&gt; kathleen made that comment about 50 year olds being the only one who care about luke skywalker this sounded very strange to me so i did some research and first of all she never said this in regards to luke skywalker specificallyit was about the original plans for galaxys edge being mos eisley but it was redesigned as a totally new and unique thing instead of something fiftysomethings remember about tatooine meaning: rebuilding a 50-year old set from memoryand second of all theres zero evidence that she actually said thisthis quote comes from someone who heard a second-hand account of a meeting between bob iger and kathleen kennedythis is not a direct quote its a game of telephone with at least three degrees of separation it was not about older fans and it was certainly not about luke skywalkerim honestly curious where you heard this from
2343,starwars,ha 👍
2344,starwars,dang ive really gotta watch more of that its true that i tend to dismiss it due to the fact its a cartoon
2345,starwars,this is best grevious
2346,starwars,hopefully we will see grogu in the temple at some point in the new material coming up 👍
2347,starwars,hehe it is a gift for my so :d
2348,starwars,space balls was fun had a lot of stupidity which i loved lucas bringing us jar jar and midichlorians was the start of the degradation of the star wars universe and disney is just hammering the nails into the coffin of my childhood
2349,starwars,i thought they were called disengages and anyone trying such a massive disengage in a fencing bout would get stabbed immediately hell i’ve done it to a foilist who was making overly large motions that would have been acceptable in foil but with an epee just left him open
2350,starwars,looks brilliant but you forgot his earring jk
2351,starwars,i’ve tried to watch it but cannot get into it being animated  not that i think animation means “for kids” but i have never enjoyed it as a mediumbut i can respect it as canon and as an art form even though it’s not for me
2352,starwars,because most of the fanbase largely disregards video games as at most broadly canon since they do have to be playable so he doesnt matter and the relative few who want him canonized dont understand the problems with him
2353,starwars,obi wan has the high ground
2354,starwars,i despise the film but have to admit those suggestions would have gone some way in improving it
2355,starwars,*grogu
2356,starwars,yes ben shapiro you use the same devil’s advocate “logic” that was played out in high school explain how i’m reinforcing gender roles when i’m saying the woman admiral should be allowed to dress and look however she wants rather than what male fans think she should look like why do you think she looks stupid then
2357,starwars,put it up for sale 😉
2358,starwars,right i agree i can only assume that reveal was just so heavily under wraps that they didn’t want to even mention it in another project they were working on for fear of it leaking just my guess is all i can only assume we’ll eventually have a round table or something of them discussing it but it’ll probably be much later after the surprise has been known a while
2359,starwars,300 dollars from sideshow collectibles highest quality one there is
2360,starwars,the one thing i really cant get over is the weird textured skin they use it’s so strange
2361,starwars,love it
2362,starwars,same here i could tolerate the clone wars art style actually came to enjoy it by the end but no matter how hard i try i just can’t get into the rebels art style add to that the horrible dialog in the first season i just can’t watch it
2363,starwars,ha i just love menacing anakin - he had to be the start 😉
2364,starwars,i dont really know much about revan does he ever show his face
2365,starwars,this is the way
2366,starwars,yes not being told the plan and seeing ship after ship blown to peices means you should blindly sit by and let things happen not ask for what the hell is going oni understand the need to stun him after the whole mutiny i just think that could have been avoided then again the whole movie could have been avoided yet here we are
2367,starwars,you amigo are an astute observer
2368,starwars,looks the comments lol
2369,starwars,
2370,starwars,my coach would kill me if i did that in a bout
2371,starwars,ben shapiro lol youre the one enforcing gender roles im just judging her as a person you can think she looks stupid and not have it be misogynistic
2372,starwars,added music cracks me up
2373,starwars,so freaking cool
2374,starwars,cool that’s make it even more amazing
2375,starwars,have you ever heard the tragedy of darth ketchup the wise i thought not its not a story the mustard would tell you darth ketchup was so strong and powerful he could be the only thing on a burger but then when he was sleeping his apprentice the mustard came and joined the burger from that moment on it was always only ketchup and only mustard on the burger
2376,starwars,i dont know but im disqualified from being a jedi because i smoke death sticks damn cantina life got me lol
2377,starwars,well probably that too i read this thrice to figure out what you were saying
2378,starwars,looks like boba looney tuned his way through the truck
2379,starwars,you are the man fucking love true metal helmets my dream is to one day create blacksmithed helmets for myself and close friends with fully integrated electronics such as headphones speakers/microphones air circulating fans lights etc all sorts of gadgets what did you make these out of
2380,starwars,one is a sniper and one is stupid i can’t remember the other two google surely can though
2381,starwars,it does lol
2382,starwars,i think you have the letters of sith mixed wrong
2383,starwars,that’s probably a good guess still makes me wonder why they don’t even mention one of the craziest moments in the season i’m just being vague for spoilers sake
2384,starwars,no it isnt yeah sure luke had some little wrestle with the dark side but still this is fairy tale level white knight luke skywalker might not be really count as an argument what i am saying next but even mark hamill thinks it doesnt make any senseyou can explain all that with headanon and whatnot and if it works for you it is great but the sequel trilogy just is very bad storytelling without even really having a story
2385,starwars,yeah its about a 2 hour drive from me
2386,starwars,i said there’s too much between ep 6 and 7 you said you wouldn’t want to see that that’s my point there’s too much in between 6 and 7
2387,starwars,i liked her my only problem was that her lightsaber movements didnt feel natural like ahsoka from clone wars but thats solvable with training and practice
2388,starwars,
2389,starwars,brilliant work cheers
2390,starwars,i personally disagree about the consistency part i think rebels is far more consistent than tcw which had you jumping around from earth shattering mandalorian stories to droids dicking around on a planet for four episodes rebels has its fair share of filler episodes too but in every case the arcs are contained to one episode if i start watching an episode about refueling or azmorigan i at least know that we’ll be moving on to something more important by the next episode
2391,starwars,yes not knowing the plan means you should do your own plan that ruins it and then not be at fault
2392,starwars,i think your dad is a sith lord
2393,starwars,she’s an admiral and leader of the resistance and she gets criticised for the way she looks that’s classic misogyny ben shapiro
2394,starwars,i never said that i was ok with the st i *hated* rise of skywalkerso fuck your damn hypocrite comment and your leap to conclusions thank you very much
2395,starwars,its burger    then
2396,starwars,right at first i get that it makes sense but the clone wars went on for 3 years over that time the built new ships but even those ships were designed for people also in the early days of the war it seems flawed to use battle droids as pilots it seems like it would have been much smarter to use specialized droids for each task rather than generic battle droids designed to pull a trigger
2397,starwars,one doesnt necessarily have to murder to use the dark side sidious used force lightning on luke without killing him; the same can be done to a criminal stopping and incapacitating them without killing them
2398,starwars,he didnt know the plan though lol
2399,starwars,how can you be a burger but only be granted ketchup and mustard its outrageous its unfair
2400,starwars,the thing is the hindsight ruins any subsequent rewatches of the movie and makes it seem like poe made the right call they should have had poe fail because of his recklessness and have it be a failure that sticks that way his arc seems like an actual arc
2401,starwars,i brought ketchup and mustard to my new burger
2402,starwars,might be an unpopular opinion but i agree i’m doing a rewatch right now and i’m surprised at how tight everything is in s1 and 2 a lot more so than i remember whereas 3 and 4 especially 3 have a lot of things that feel more inconsequential in the long run i think it’s especially true for people doing rewatches because we know that a lot of the so-called “filler” in 1 &amp; 2 end up being relevant by the end &gt;space whales anyone&lt;
2403,starwars,i suppose it’s not entirely akin to luke daenerys was definitely intended to be a villain at the end but the turn was abrupt and not built up to there was foreshadowing but foreshadowing is not buildup granted i never read the books so i’m strictly speaking on the show’s level we also tend to forget that game of thrones is a show about war and killing which becomes a natural robb stark killed people jon killed jamie killed daenerys crucifiying the slave masters and executing the tarley’s were violence in a show about violence her killing civilians does come out of nowhere if they actually spent enough time fleshing out the plot rather than try to unfold it in 2 episodes then it would have been better i’m not doubting the actual choice of making her go mad i’m just doubting the execution it kind of goes the same with luke if we are to truly believe that he is a bitter loser then give us more to flesh all of it out
2404,starwars,duuuude where did you find this
2405,starwars,the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural
2406,starwars,this is seriously cool great job
2407,starwars,thats not misogynistic though unless youre implying hair and clothes are gender specific
2408,starwars,flying away from somewhere on hoth
2409,starwars,right if i didn’t move so many times  as a kid i’m sure my lego slave i and all my other custom spaceships would still be intact 😭happy to see you still got yours
2410,starwars,i ate them i ate them all and not just the burgers but the fries and the chicken nuggets too
2411,starwars,here is an article that lays out the information given in art of star wars: the last jeditl;dr: george wrote a treatment for the sequel trilogy after the disney buyout these were largely thrown out by jj abrams but the idea of an older more cynical luke living in exile was kept as well as the new protagonist of the sequel trilogy kira later renamed reythis is also supported by dave filoni in an interview with dealinein art of star wars: the mandalorian dave filoni talks about his work on the last jedi set and bow rian taught him how to film live-action
2412,starwars,enjoy your award and keep at it
2413,starwars,it wasnt  when disney took overthe beginnings of lucafilm creating star wars legends came when george started developing the sequel trilogy technically a few years earlier when he started disregarding it for the clone wars it wasnt finalised until 2014
2414,starwars,definitely check out the expanded universe/legends has some of my favorite stories and honestly i still consider a lot of it canon
2415,starwars,these images still hurt my heart i remember seeing that movie as a child opening night my friends father took us and we stood in line with lightsabers and the press was all around interviewing people one guy being interviewed was visibly upset looked right into the camera saying “that was a piece of shit” and storming off i’ll never forget walking out after seeing it feeling so confused something in my head told me it wasn’t good but i didn’t know why years later the third movie came out and i completely skipped it i asked my friend how it was and he said “anakin became darth vader it was a bit better than the other two” it would years before i watched it wasn’t impressed
2416,starwars,you really dont have a single thing worth saying do you utterly vacuous
2417,starwars,ahaha lol gets to the whole wrong planet flys all the way there just to realize hes in the wrong place lmao this guy is banned from being a jedi kr sith haha jk
2418,starwars,i’ve been rewatching rebels recently and i’m surprised at how much more i like it the second time around i used to think that people who ranked rebels higher than tcw were crazy but i get it now; it’s a solid entry into the star wars mythos while all the characters individually are pretty strong my favorite being sabine i think what this show nails is the sense that the crew are a family my favorite moments are when hera and kanan refer to the others as their kids and when they tell them to “make mom and dad proud” the specters truly feel like a family in a way that no other star wars story has for me and it’s heartwarming to see their little interactions develop over the course of the series rebels never had an enormous budget like tcw to show off flashy spectacles like the siege of mandalore but because of that it was forced to really zero in on character stuff and that ended up really working for me *trials of the darksaber* is still one of my favorite star wars stories of all time even though it takes place on one planet with the interactions of two characters shouldering most of the dramatic weight *and it’s so good* i understand why a lot of people might prefer tcw to rebels but i really think the scales are starting to tip for me
2419,starwars,blue darth maul yay
2420,starwars,i agree shirtless thrawn
2421,starwars,none of that was a circle parry
2422,starwars,but its more complicated than that because in star wars doing evil things isnt just walked away from like nothing itll actually corrupt your soul and tint you towards wanting to do more evil
2423,starwars,it also gets really bloody dark at times to
2424,starwars,how can it be only ketchup only mustard and also plain  that is some sith magic right there
2425,starwars,so you’re saying that you don’t wanna watch ben solo struggle to fall to the darkside but you’re totally cool with the trilogy about rey struggling with the darkside damn hypocritical if you ask me
2426,starwars,i wouldnt say fucked up rather it let him see vader clearly and that there was a chance to talk him downthe backup plan was that the rebels would destroy the death star anyway as far as luke was concerned hed be dead soon and the emperor and vader with him
2427,starwars,it would corrupt your decision making after a short time and you’d end up being evil you don’t get to cheat the dark side anakin had good intentions and within a couple days he was strangling his wife it twists your very being until you become what you swear to destroy
2428,starwars,how did you even find this
2429,starwars,yeah no no fucking love stories please mandalorian is doing really well without that crap
2430,starwars,the expanded universe covered this for the most part but it was  from canon when disney took over
2431,starwars,absolutely fire my guy
2432,starwars,in fairness he had a dark lord of the sith both in his head and ear if palpatine had been unable to convince anakin to leave the temple things would have been very different padme lost the will to live after learning everything she did about anakin im sure force choking accelerated it but officially padme simply didnt *want* to live anymore despite being a new mother
2433,starwars,which never would have happened had holdo just told her subordinates the plan
2434,starwars,yes i know that
2435,starwars,i know but bobas lack of force ability makes his survival less plausible imo
2436,starwars,rian* it’s all right i know typos happen
2437,starwars,yes youre complaining we didnt get to see ben solo fall to the dark side hes a skywalker weve already seen anakin fall to the dark side
2438,starwars,i want to believe
2439,starwars,all star wars fans are still star wars fans
2440,starwars,yeah but none of them played as major of a role as plo koon even aayla has less lines in a cannon film/show as plo
2441,starwars,the build up to daenerys going full aerys is heavily hinted and built up from season 1 maybe it’s that i read the books and it’s foreshadowed there in an even more obvious way but i was always confused when people said her turn on kings landing was abrupt i have a lot of problems with that final season but that was never one of my problems
2442,starwars,all i hear is a seismic charge
2443,starwars,this is not a build the jedi would show you
2444,starwars,the blue series are 2002-2004 aprox
2445,starwars,i am too lazy to go in to details but i would love to see a jedi that asked to be frozen  in carbonite in order to escape order 66 hes/er body is then hidden in a place where only future generations of jedi could decipher the map/clues and unfreeze him it would be nice if he is discovered in the mando timeline
2446,starwars,look at him ☺️
2447,starwars,a prophecy that ends all conflict is fundamentally uninteresting and was immediately defied by countless writers in the eu and then again in the new-canon i expected it to be essentially erased the second we saw kylo ren bust out the red crossguard-saber in the 2014 tfa teaser that meant that balance was not permanently restored would i have brought papa-palpatine back no but that’s ultimately irrelevant to the question
2448,starwars,back when the sw sets were still made to last im glad i still have a few from that golden period
2449,starwars,watched this last night i didn’t notice in the security hologram the younglings have lightsabers to try to defend themselves makes it that much sadder but also probably gave enough time for grogu to escape
2450,starwars,he didn’t attack ben on impulse he had the impulse and stopped himself
2451,starwars,they look ridiculous to be more fun
2452,starwars,yeah i have not seen the blue series must be newer
2453,starwars,new rebellion and crystal star are pretty unbearable
2454,starwars,
2455,starwars,😕
2456,starwars,run
2457,starwars,here is link to the video showcasing all of my lego star wars creations in 2020 for anyone interested i will be happy to hear your feedback: 
2458,starwars,just occurred to me - what if sidious had forgotten to tell the clones that anakin doesn’t count as a jedi what if the clones had killed him on sight because of order 66 bet sidious would have felt really silly then - all that effort to secure a new apprentice and he fluffs it at the final hurdle
2459,starwars,the oldest ones are from 1995 up to 2002 the episode ii ones and the vintage i dont remember; maybe 2010s
2460,starwars,where does he fit in the universe i have not watched/read his character
2461,starwars,that’s london kentucky you may want to rethink that
2462,starwars,lol that would have made much more sense tho
2463,starwars,it bothers me slightly that you didnt show this chronologically 🤣
2464,starwars,
2465,starwars,ok tell the expert in the video hes wrong id assume like every other language meaning changes across time and circumstance have you studied 300 year old french
2466,starwars,i probably should’ve phrased my question better i meant is there any precedent for bo katan to find groups of non human mandos in the galaxy to help take back mandalore
2467,starwars,*coos*
2468,starwars,he even looks into the camera like oh shit i wonder if ill be on tv
2469,starwars,they take a lot of space and need the money; ive been storing them in boxes but better to make some other collector happy
2470,starwars,no they kind of all looked the same
2471,starwars,
2472,starwars,now i need to go to london
2473,starwars,were the burgers a little on the dark side
2474,starwars,thank you
2475,starwars,and then watch rebels the calm measured voice is too perfect
2476,starwars,neat idea looks good
2477,starwars,it doesnt look like fencing at all to me maybe thats what fighting with a flail would look like because youre trying to maintain momentum but it bares little resemblance to any type of sword fighting ive seen in actual competition or even martial arts that try to be authentic
2478,starwars,thank you i’ve been learning procreate since christmas hope i did him justice
2479,starwars,anustart
2480,starwars,what year are these from
2481,starwars,fuck yes dawg
2482,starwars,it does have some good moments but some pretty kiddy stuff too that’s not bad necessarily
2483,starwars,aaw why are you putting them up for sale save them
2484,starwars,i think so
2485,starwars,i use a lot of tiles which means most surfaces are smooth 👍
2486,starwars,just watched empire strikes back this morning and this gives me so many feelsss
2487,starwars,i mean its just not that aesthetically pleasing to me plus im still not over how they explained ahsoka surviving vader when there could have been millions of other more plausible options such as temple collapses and ahsoka escapesetc
2488,starwars,true that they never care about the damn troops smh
2489,starwars,hahaha the 4th along ive had as my phone and laptop background for over a year now how did you make these
2490,starwars,i can only assume it’s a covid situation even in a few shots of the one episode we got there were already people starting to wear masks
2491,starwars,it takes more than a second or moment to sense the darkness decide in the middle of the night to walk to bens hut pull your lightsaber contemplate making a killing blow and thus drawing then igniting his lightsaber all of this while logically rationalizing why it is his only course of actionthe movie portrays this more as a premeditated and self rationalized murder that he couldnt go through with at the last second not some instant rush of irrational homicide that passed in an moment
2492,starwars,i mean they’re talking about something fundamentally unimportant - a movie so no
2493,starwars,not that there isnt sadly too much overlap but comparing uptight nerds to actual nazis is a bit hyperbolic
2494,starwars,&gt; lukes change in tlj goes beyond simply ideology which would be fine its believable to drastically change your mindset after a traumatic experience its not believable to change your core characteristic behavior instead of him being just disillusioned which would be fine hes also rude messy and uncaring he throws the lightsaber away he ignores rey tells her to go away and spends the entire film just being a jerk who is this rude asshole where is luke luke disillusioned or not it is very hard to believe that this is the same character this appears to be an entirely new onehe’s uncaring whattlj portrays a luke that cares deeply about everything he’s so affected by what happens he goes into isolation he clearly wants to help but is paralyzed by his fear and guilt these other traits rude disillusioned are symptoms of that guilt he’s trying to rationalize his errors he’s doing what we all do but tlj as a movie doesn’t let him get away with that &gt; ask yourself what character traits does tlj share with rotj luke besides the name they’re both highly emotional caring quick to act/react struggling with fear/darkside and ultimately good they’re the same character what’s luke’s defining trait in the ot his struggle to control his fears and combat the darkside that’s a lifelong struggle and it forms the core of his arc in the sequels
2495,starwars,*points gun* you disin clone wars
2496,starwars,how they look sosmooth and round
2497,starwars,no not at all their blades go behind their backs thats not going to parry anything its also meant to move a lunge off line not block a sweeping chop which isnt really a thing in fencingits still just as goofy as it always was and closer to dancing than fighting
2498,starwars,the yolk doesnt turn into the chicken  the yolk is the source of energy and nutrients
2499,starwars,damn thats stupidly good
2500,starwars,oh man just got a strong nostalgia slap straight to the feels
2501,starwars,the new republic is not the resistance though
2502,starwars,ummm news flash but there’s also like 20 books about boba’s return becoming mandalore and training han and leia’s daughter to fight jedi so she can defeat her brother
2503,starwars,can you elaborate the tonal diffrencekylo is vader jr rey is luke jr execpt instead of im your father im your lover and palps is there again just to explain it was gim doing everything like the prequelsmy issue is they copied half the ot but then went around like wait were this all new thing no your not lolthe new chars were ot rip offs and the old chars had those new ideas they had all they had to do was give the storys to the opposite characters
2504,starwars,younglings playtime decreases
2505,starwars,i need a zip code please
2506,starwars,back into the vault then
2507,starwars,i get the impression of someone who is great at world building and ideas but has absolutely no concept of human psychologythe fact that these film do poorly in real life buddhist cultures is a tip off that hes just another westerner trying to play up a non western philosophy as something exotic and cool
2508,starwars,im a strong believer that you can watch mandalorian without watching zero other content but the guy said binge star wars so im assuming he/she wants the whole thing
2509,starwars,that would be awesome to see and i want that in my life now
2510,starwars,in the old eu being a mandalorian is a creed not a bloodline  adoption of a young individual was considered the highest honor and by doing so brought in another warrior into the fold  hopefully this is a practice introduced into the new canon
2511,starwars,lol you’re out here saying that the head of a business didn’t hire an employee of said business and had basically nothing to do with the product that was produced despite the fact that the boss’ name is still all over the product the boss and employee have both appeared together on screen talking with each other about the creation of the product and you’re out here still baselessly claiming that the boss didn’t hire said employee i think you were one of the people campaigning for separate universes dude you’re already living in a different universe i’m done
2512,starwars,its the sword hilts not curved
2513,starwars,thanks
2514,starwars,then why would marriage kids deep friendship be forbidden why conscript and indoctrinate from the cradle its horrible when its the first order but totally fine for jedi smelling bantha crapthe jedi fear what they cant control which makes them not really different from what they fight in some regards
2515,starwars,this is probably my biggest with the fan base on here i think the dialogue and characters are super mediocre to average in mando always had trouble getting into the animated series for a similar reason though it does seem like the characters are probably stronger there
2516,starwars,one bombers payload was enough to annihilate an entire dreadnought poe just deployed them in a moronic strategy that was never supposed to be executed in the first place
2517,starwars,that looks epic
2518,starwars,no animated series finale had me crying like that since atla
2519,starwars,this is epic
2520,starwars,yeah definitely backwards they took all the xwing’s thai fighters the death star the force the light savers all of the things that look like star wars on the surface but when you don’t include luke leah han lando and you don’t even reunite them on screen once they take away the things that feel like star wars
2521,starwars,its weird they half just did ot again but at same time tried making it new with new ideas chars but they kept bouncing from this we are the ot no  wait were brand new too when they werentbasiaclly the new chars were ot rip offs and old chars were theyre new ideas personalitys like backwards if you ask me
2522,starwars,i am confident that after episode eight bob iger has reduced her influence over the brand there’s no way you’re going to trust kathleen kennedy with star wars after what she did with episode eight             and no she didn’t hire jon favreau for the mandalorian it was his idea she and introduced him to dave filoni
2523,starwars,why is your mustafar moc 10x better than the official set :0
2524,starwars,yeah seemed pretty much implied this is the project that leads to the snoke and palpatine clones
2525,starwars,this is incredible excelent work
2526,starwars,i have several friends who are huge star wars fans who refuse to even watch the clone wars because theyre cartoons but love and rewatch the animated promo mini movies for knights of the old republic it annoys me so much
2527,starwars,not mine
2528,starwars,she hired favreau and filoni for mandalorian just as she hired rian for tlj and while she’s the head of lucasfilm she has the final say on everything lucasfilm produces so yes she had the same amount of influence over the mandalorian as she did tlj
2529,starwars,true but it isnt just all yolk once its been fertilised
2530,starwars,the man who would never abandon his friends wouldn’t kill his own father do you know what never mind i think i need to know all i need to know from your reply it’s just praise star wars makes you happy who am i to stop that have a good day may the force be with you
2531,starwars,lol this is just going around in circlesall your ideas are dumb and awful and if they happened in the movie you would call them dumbnot liking a movie is fine not understanding the very basic storyline because you didn’t like a character is stupid
2532,starwars,but he used a batman quote and it sounded universally usable atleast if you have this opinion for some reason
2533,starwars,masterpiece
2534,starwars,“that was pretty wizard wasn’t it son”“w-what”“i’m bringing it back”
2535,starwars,very
2536,starwars,my favorite set mine is hopefully still in my parents storage broken most likely however
2537,starwars,to east europe how much is it
2538,starwars,ah yes holdo and rose = dumb poe = smarthmmm
2539,starwars,the lights out and the saber lighting always gets me a thrill 😁
2540,starwars,i seehuh i wonder then what moff gideon is taking his orders from atm palpatine i guessthat sucks
2541,starwars,thank you i love that little guy 😭😭😭
2542,starwars,i can reconcile it i know who luke is in the ot and i know who he is in the st it’s an outstanding work of writing for luke in the st and mark elevates the writing even more with his acting
2543,starwars,lol sound logic can’t believe someone isn’t taking you seriously online
2544,starwars,
2545,starwars,not true at all she hired rian johnson abandon jjs original plan came up with a new one she had no such influence over the mandalorian           jon favreau came up with the story hired the directors worked with the story group and special-effects teams to create new technology very different
2546,starwars,it was more of a bummer because they didn’t even touch on some pretty massive plot points or barely skimped over some i wrongly assumed episode 1 was an overview and then subsequent episodes would be about each individual episode
2547,starwars,
2548,starwars,so funny
2549,starwars,thanks
2550,starwars,except there’s a complete tonal difference and we also don’t want the same movie over and over
2551,starwars,you can’t reconcile the ot luke who would never abandon his friends with the st luke who left them all to die at the hands of their own kid           unless you’re undemanding about consistency
2552,starwars,i dont like that they brought palpatine back so i just try not to think about it honestly
2553,starwars,interesting cause other fans are saying he is a great character
2554,starwars,wish i still had this one around
2555,starwars,id think the shipping might cost you more  than the figure im from mexico
2556,starwars,where else is a force-sensitive going to go in a post rotj galaxy luke             why is grogu 50 because kathleen made that comment about 50 year olds being the only ones who care about luke skywalker
2557,starwars,im honestly someone who likes comics more than text books people will make fun of me for that i dont care nothing childish about reading them just cause they have pictures im more invested i dont like reading or hearing books and using my imagination to think it out like its some old radio drama from the 1920s we have the option to not do that anymoreid like also to bring in that prince xizor guy but he probably isnt disneu anymore either
2558,starwars,i was also disappointed that they only did one episode for all of season two
2559,starwars,this is a star wars subreddit
2560,starwars,
2561,starwars,\*2013
2562,starwars,came out really good well done
2563,starwars,you’re merging two completely unrelated things and the only connection is they both upset you
2564,starwars,
2565,starwars,i don’t like sand it’s coarse rough and irritating and it gets everywhere
2566,starwars,holy crap i was just on legocom and i hadnt seen 501st minifigs since 2014 in the clone wars line
2567,starwars,dont know still; theyre all opened some yellowed and some have missing parts; thinking about $450sud for all of them plus shipping im from mexico and have more figures in boxes still
2568,starwars,yes this is a discussion about star wars though
2569,starwars,thrawn was involved in campaigns suppressing rebels in batonn and other worlds; in all those campaigns he was extremely successful enough that he was promoted to the highest possible rank in the imperial navy even though he faced anti-alien prejudice not even unthinking prejudice could hide the fact that he was easily one of their best officers by a parsec when the empire collapsed thrawn was left basically stranded with his fleet and nobody left to report to his orders came like *from the top* and there was no top anymore but so great was his ambition that he hatched a plan to rebuild the empire using just the fleet at his commandhe didnt win i dont usually consider it a spoiler to say the bad guy lost in the end but his efforts were enough to make the fledgling new republic genuinely afraid for its existence
2570,starwars,
2571,starwars,this looks awesome
2572,starwars,uh
2573,starwars,i hate lego but that’s awesome nice work
2574,starwars,i think we both did my friend :p
2575,starwars,epic shit ben
2576,starwars,i agree and i hate to sound overly negative as i have been enjoying newer star wars content recently and i am excited for many of the new upcoming shows i guess i just worry cause i see more opportunities to mess up with this series hopefully i’m wrong and i hope that they are thinking hard about decisions they make before just charging in and doing them nothing would make me happier than being wrong about this series and it being great
2577,starwars,this is heartwarming :oh and grogu is so damn cute
2578,starwars,deleted
2579,starwars,the jawas took it
2580,starwars,the fanmade 501st troop minifigs are so cool
2581,starwars,&gt;even for a second  well the answer to that is a simple yes moments of weakness are fine so long as consistency is held in the final result which it is moments later as luke is able to resist and overcome the darkness but before he realizes he needs to turn off the lightsaber ben wakes up
2582,starwars,see threepio and artoo is often how they’re spelled in print or dialogue always have been
2583,starwars,this moc is most impressive
2584,starwars,thrawn is a bamf  he’s honestly my favorite villain  i like him slightly better even than vader   sadly the original books are no longer cannon but those stories are sooo good  and give us the han leia and luke we all want  i saw your comment about having a hard time reading novels have you tried audiobooks  i have a commute and they’re a real life saver
2585,starwars,
2586,starwars,well thats more of a star wars thingi meant it more in general
2587,starwars,my kids were very young when the prequels came out im pretty sure i showed them the ot first i do recall taking them to see rots in theaters we were watching all the star wars when they were little even the ewok movies and the ewok and droids cartoons on dvd my oldest was 11 when the clone wars was in theaters in 2008 i took her and her bff to see it i remember we all came thinking wtf did i just watch and then we watched tcw together as it came out weekly and she basically grew up as ahsoka did now we nerd together over sw
2588,starwars,yes thats the reason why ive uploaded the video because he looks like a random bored man thinking about the next bill to pay meantime thinking about what burger take for lunch no bodyguards no nice clothes no expensive stuff i can confuse him with anyone of my neighbors lol
2589,starwars,agreed lost stars was great
2590,starwars,but man was he bad at math
2591,starwars,few other small details i love: just before the fight anakin is trying to convince obi-wan to join him my allegiance is to the republic to democracy  he argues that he has brought about the very things the jedi have worked towards for years peace freedom justice and security in anakins eyes the ends justify the means in the fight i believe anakin wants to prove to himself and to obi-wan that he is stronger this can be seen during the many  times they use the same maneuvers but obi wan is forced into continuous retreat he go so far as to warn obi-wan of his impending death on even ground obi-wan accepts that he loses this fight everytime no matter what and still this is not enough for anakin obi-wan is not the most powerful or the best he is the most experienced strength is important but knowing when and how to use it is more important
2592,starwars,according to the book “a certain point of view” boba has nothing to do with it
2593,starwars,try saving me maul
2594,starwars,i take it thawn works for the empire if so how does he get by with his tactics and not face punishment from vader and emperoryeah he sounds excellent and the exact type of villian we should have had in sequel trilogy not trying to beat a dead horse but absolutely no reason for a sequel trilogy to have a rehashed vader moff and palpatine knights of ren phasma and de toros character could have been kept on i had no problem with them
2595,starwars,yes that would be much better i’ll look out for one 👍
2596,starwars,very good suggestions
2597,starwars,yeah some of these articles are sourced from an actual reddit comment which is both lame and complimentary to us redditers but i kind of like it because i admittedly don’t scrub reddit for every single interesting post like i should as far as the stakes when a character dies in a multiverse i think it depends on the character and how well the situation/episode etc is written first i love marvel and  the mcu and think this will and already has worked great because they have really good writing producing and character development so it just gives them unlimited avenues to hash out stories as far as it being introduced to sw as long as they do it right i mean they already showed grumpy jake skywalker in the st and he died and that was it then they did what they did in mando and i was balling my eyes out the first time i saw it so i guess we will see where they go with this i’m tired of fighting and arguing about the st which i have definitely been a part of so i’m going to just sit back and enjoy the content i enjoy and let others do the same
2598,starwars,pog
2599,starwars,peusdo-eastern bs you sound like a fool lol lucas did more research in writing  sw than you have in understanding it
2600,starwars,rip and tear
2601,starwars,how much for all of them
2602,starwars,attachment means to control love without attachment is not only good but a common theme in world religion and philosophy
2603,starwars,he is absolutely just a blue moff tarkin he could have been anybody there is literally nothing special about him other than the fanbases obsession with him and that obsession comes from the thrawn series coming years after rotj and it has gl stamp of approval on it basically if you give a starving man a rotten sandwich hes gonna eat it hell really enjoy it too couple that with feelings of nostalgia we all feel when remembering our childhoods and the fact most of the fanbase were children when they first read it that will always remember that sandwich with fond memories because it fed him in his time of need hes a great tactician so great that zhan couldnt write a satisfying ending for his trilogy so he used a deus ex machina to end the series then brought that mf back like palpatine in tros several times you could watch rebels and get a perfect picture of his character blue bad thats it
2604,starwars,what was that drastic change though
2605,starwars,yep perfect
2606,starwars,thanks
2607,starwars,this is really good thanks  also it underscore that attachment is not good but love is good people need to stop saying attachment is ok but not clinging since attachment is clinging
2608,starwars,yeah lol
2609,starwars,legendscanon
2610,starwars,nice collections
2611,starwars,what they are doing is disengaging not circle parrying it is a very common and the real fencers only do this when they know the other fencer extremely well is bs because its a super common thing in fencing
2612,starwars,nice really good
2613,starwars,coming
2614,starwars,big gooberfish
2615,starwars,i love that george looks so normal but the dude is fucking billionaire who created arguably the greatest ip of all time
2616,starwars,kennedy had as much to do with the mandalorian as she did the last jedi
2617,starwars,
2618,starwars,thank you
2619,starwars,theyd have to be friends turned enemies during the clone warsand tarkin would pursue him through the dark stormy mountainous regions of serenno to his creepy castle to defeat him once and for all i must be a bad fan because im like ten times more interested in that than i am in what boba fetts been up to
2620,starwars,
2621,starwars,i’m a fan of star wars and i liked luke’s portrayal in tlj so i guess that wraps that up then
2622,starwars,dang i wish we had this technology when i was a kid i had to use strings and a polorioid camera to get the lightsaber to float
2623,starwars,escaped the death star with the plans and a member of alderaan royalty one of the few surviving pilots that destroyed the death star who delivered the killshot and avenged alderaan brother to a general of the rebellion/member of alderaan royalty guy who walked into a room with vader and the senate and left supporting the beaten down body of a former sith lord and not a hint of recognition
2624,starwars,thanks; i hope so as well
2625,starwars,loved the artstyle keep them coming
2626,starwars,elvis was a jedi
2627,starwars,its not shown well on-screen but its supposed to demonstrate how much faster and more lethal palps is than highly trained jedi some slo-mo camera work or other choreography might have made that fight better on screen one could also argue that these highly trained just walked into the office of an old politician theyve respected and given their allegiance to for years and suddenly  hes leaping through the air with a red lightsaber using a force scream and they just froze at how ridiculously unexpected it was
2628,starwars,i think you’re going to be the one needing to source the claims you’ve made about grogu being introduced just to use him to eventually reintroduce luke and filoni has been open about his time spent with rian on the set of tlj
2629,starwars,yeah a lot of people didn’t like that and that’s fine by me 🤷🏻‍♀️thank you drawing expressions and emotions is my favorite thing ☺️
2630,starwars,ok
2631,starwars,may the force send someone that will take good care of them
2632,starwars,this movie was trash but your suggestions all would have been improvements
2633,starwars,oh man this is something i need to do too just started dming a ffg sw rpg and realizing i know legit nothing --
2634,starwars,zahn wanted to make his literary trilogy very distinct from the ot so he set out to make thrawn basically the opposite of palpatine and vader he wears a bright white uniform instead of dark shadowy robes instead of executing subordinates he rewards their innovation and skill he doesnt have dark unholy power or even the might of a huge galactic superpower behind him he has to rely purely on his strategic brilliance thrawn is partially inspired by sherlock holmes his eccentric but brilliant ploys his analytical genius and attention to small details the way his plans always make perfect sense in hindsight and partially by napoleon bonaparte an outsider from a rustic setting who climbed the ladder of a corrupt society through his own merits and who sets about rebuilding a fallen empire really hes just a very simple yet impressive character
2635,starwars,at first i didnt really care for rebels at all but its grown on me by far the worst thing about the series is the fact that steve blum voices like every fucking side character
2636,starwars,is putting things like this on a spinning tray/platter type of thing normal i think that would be cool for a display
2637,starwars,i got mine at half price books for 50¢ so fear not
2638,starwars,this is partially my personal gripe with disney and star wars there is a ton of new content to keep up with it’s almost not feasible all of the books novelizations movies animated shows and now the seven or eight live action shows they’re planning and the new high republic bookswho has the time to keep up
2639,starwars,and ptsd is not the only mental disorder than can occur in former soldiers its just the most common regardless of the actual diagnosis that man was broken by what he lived thru and had to do
2640,starwars,this is also the self heal animation for the sith in star wars the old republic
2641,starwars,what fun
2642,starwars,r/theyknew
2643,starwars,there is a great video called three faces of vader saying that the villains of the prequels each represent an aspect of him maul the unbridled rage dooku the fallen-from-grace swordsman and grevious the half-robot who lost his humanity worth a watch:
2644,starwars,and some slaneshi demonettes too hmmm
2645,starwars,
2646,starwars,
2647,starwars,i don’t understand what you’re trying to say my idea another skywalker fall to the dark side
2648,starwars,its sort of wild to me that the story has been rewritten in peoples heads so that it occupies a central place in the star wars narrative whereas when it was introduced it was clearly meant to be something thata was obviously being wildly misinterpreted or over-interpreted by the jedi to their own downfallb wouldnt come to pass in a really meaningful way we already knew anakin would not save the galaxy in a grand or meaningfully expansive way we already knew what would happen anakin would yeet the emperor down a shaft and then only bring about the end of the sith by dying himselfc inherently contained the destruction of the jedi order within iti always interpreted the prophecy as part of the problems with the jedi too caught up with the dogma of their order and their faith in the chosen one they failed to see the suffering of the man in front of them never their minds on the here and now
2649,starwars,they use to sell ones for $9999 at places like spencers in the mall i remember them selling vaders lukes and mace windus but that was when i was at the mall which was like 15 years ago so i dont know ebay
2650,starwars,wow very nice how much does the raw material cost to make this
2651,starwars,
2652,starwars,i think because the character was basically allowed to voice his griefs with the whole star wars property these big ass expensive wars keep happening and the little peoples lives never get better the empire is a bunch of under-trained racist white supremacists that make up for lack of skill with numbers and superior tech the rebellion/new republic is essentially a terrorist organization of loosely organized cells that cause just as much collateral damage to the people they are claiming to help the only real winners in the star wars universe are the corporations making all the gear for the war machine sound familiar
2653,starwars,metro spartan helmet would be dope
2654,starwars,the sabers look like rebels style
2655,starwars,to me 1 to 6 feels like one story the fall of the republic and the rise of the empire among other thingsi never considered politics boring or hard to understand i think it was fascinating seeing how it all happened
2656,starwars,you see some disintegrations in mandalorian  there’s a lot less left than what luke found of owen and beruif your friend likes that headcanon though then i’m glad he’s finding fun ways to add things to the universe his own way
2657,starwars,im not a big fan of this film i found it kinda boring i know how i feel about this film is not exactly the point here the point is i love these changes they didnt change anything from the story or the messages of the film yet they might have made it more fun to watch for me personally at least and might have helped me like this film
2658,starwars,*sorry* dreadnought the mobile app was covering up the other comment and it was late enough that i didnt care about spellingthat aside we as the audience thats watched this before know that poe made the right choice in taking down the dreadnought but you cant judge the plot from hindsight but rather the decisions that lead up to the moment the resistance *didnt know* that the dreadnought could follow them and having all ships ready to jump was the safest option at the time losing 20 soldiers for one dreadnought vs saving everyone and retreating to a safe location to gather more help is an easy decision to make i cant recall if the dog fights started before or after the jump so i wont factor that into my judgment but if was before then that makes poes decision even worse to everyone
2659,starwars,god i love star wars
2660,starwars,ah nice liked that too the only thing i thought was weird at first was that luke looked like a girl i still like it i think you catch the emotions very good and it looks heartwarming also in this drawing here you captured rosario dawsons laugh very good
2661,starwars,whatever energy pedro pascal has i need it
2662,starwars,my cousin is alt-right he joined because antifa wouldn’t free his slave mother or let him save his wife from dying someone on qanon said they could cheat death and now he’s a proud boy
2663,starwars,well you will have to watch tcw season 7 to find out i wont spoil it for you
2664,starwars,and for the argument that was originally made to justify the lightspeed ram shit with its a really rare occurrence for it to work then just have some cheap droid starfighters lightspeed ram it to increase the chance
2665,starwars,im just glad you arent in charge of star wars because your idea sounds like a snooze festive already seen a skywalker fall to the dark side i dont need to see it again
2666,starwars,i see what mutations do they have
2667,starwars,luke is the important character what are you talking about it was luke who redeemed vader he was the protagonist in ot prequels didnt change that they only connected the trilogies in terms of saga being anakins story but that doesnt change lukes importance nor it means it is inconsistent
2668,starwars,thanks it just bothers me disney wanted to remake the ot so bad they just erased all the work our og heroes did
2669,starwars,thanks
2670,starwars,this is legit bro
2671,starwars,republic commando is some of the best content legends has to offer probably only second to timothy zahn’s original thrawn trilogy
2672,starwars,jj just messed up shouldn’t have brought palpatine back
2673,starwars,i’d pay good money just for the mustafar bit
2674,starwars,kid and i finally binged the rest of the season last night we were both 100% on point about his character it was great it was an awesome scene you can see the point on his face when he decides this guy has to die for being so willing to sacrifice so many troops to essentially lose the planet anyway finn got bad script but the actor at least tried to portray seems to me that the character was trying to bury the ptsd in bad humor and keeping busy so busy he didnt have time to notice the pain honestly i would like to see finn get a mini-series just so that actor has a chance to do it justice
2675,starwars,i cry for callus epilogue every single time
2676,starwars,that anakin had a padawan  that anakin had believable character development and really was a war hero making his fall in the movies that much more powerful
2677,starwars,to which thing
2678,starwars,it thematically doesn’t make sense why luke would attack ben on impulse luke single handedly talked down and returned darth fucking vader to the light side refusing to kill him because he sensed the conflict in his mind and that he was his dad keep in mind that up until this point vader was arguably the second most evil person in the galaxy at that time relentlessly taking part in a genocidal crusade against the jedi order which despite treating him like an outcast was the closest thing he had to a family vader was a monster and luke despite knowing fine well what he was capable of and what he had done chose to convert him back to the light even though vader was really past the point of redemptionhe gets one flicker of evil from ben and he decides that’s enough for him to be considered a threat ben by this point hadn’t even done anything evil he just had dark thoughts and that was enough for the man who converted a sith lord to think he needed destroyed even for a second not to mention that he is literally his nephew and clearly had a large roll in raising him it doesn’t make sense for luke’s character to end up that way no matter how you try and spin it
2679,starwars,ohh i never heard of this deal
2680,starwars,ok ill think for a bit seems valid enough at first sight
2681,starwars,i mostly agree with you but i’m just not happy with any setting that include loser hermit luke not now now ever
2682,starwars,you dont decide what this conversation is about and i was bringing up a point that is essential to this as you started to bash me for being a bad human it was not a strawman pretty sad to go that lowviolence is essential in life it is one manifestation of power if you argue against that you argue against the need for a police for a military etcsince there is no free will no one is truly guilty everyone is innocent when we punish people by law we do it under the illusion that they had a choice this illusion happens when the causal chain of the decision these people made is not clear or perceived as not essential although it always is essentialanakin as everyone else had no free choice in his specific instance his jedi order indoctrination couldnt complete fully because he was old when coming into he order and more talented than everyone else then he started to develop a substantial sex drive and therefore married now the false visions of sidious started as well as the order shitting on anakin now sidious offers him saving his wife but he has to do his bidding unconditionally again since anakin has a pretty big sex drive and also since windu shitted on him he agrees he now does his bidding including slaughtering the younglings when padme arrives at him he chokes her out of anger since he thinks she betrayed him and she was the one he risked everything fornow how could this have went differently not when the boogeyman free will made anakin do different but when the causal chain simply was different for example when his genes made him less talented less sex drivy when he was indoctrinated earlier when he was treated better by the jedi order or whatever else could have influenced his brain but he had his fate like everyone elsethis doesnt mean that we shouldnt punish people for doing things thats fine to keep order but when we do it we should be clear about doing it to keep an order or better: to keep the world as we the people in power desire it to be and we shouldnt invent free will to then invent moral to then invent guilt to then feel like these people deserve their unlucky fate as if they could have changed it to then feel like we deserve better instead of just admitting that we overpower them to keep the world as we like
2683,starwars,that’s incredible
2684,starwars,they are kinda like an elite squad of troopers with special mutations and since they were not deemed fit for the battlefield by the kaminoans the created a way to serve in other ways its pretty much the canon version of delta squad from the republic commando video game
2685,starwars,yes
2686,starwars,hopefully because the sequels arent bad at all ofc there are points is weakness but it will eventually become iconic points of weekness like bad dialogue in the prequels or even jar jar hated but loved because he is a sith lord
2687,starwars,did you made that drawing where ahsoka met luke and he told her that anakin came back to the light side
2688,starwars,no that’s not the pointi didn’t say “what we saw was a great depiction of what luke could be if he went through the traumatic event of trying to murder his nephew” i said it wasn’t luke skywalkerthey butchered his character and i find it unforgivable i’m glad you enjoy those movies but for me that will never be luke and your attempts to explain why it is aren’t convincing at all
2689,starwars,hyperspace does hyperspace isnt the ship going really fast its a different dimension and also if you could just lightspeed ram shit and destroy everything that negates literally every single space battle in star wars death star 1 and 2 why not just lightspeed ram it separatist blockade just lightspeed ram it oh starkiller base just lightspeed ram it whats the point in building battle stations just have a super star destroyer lightspeed ram the planet it literally makes no sense is the problem
2690,starwars,i cant agree with the last point but i really hope they can turn around the disaster caused by the sequelsbut anyway thats a great drawing and a beautiful story
2691,starwars,
2692,starwars,biggest problem is too much shit goes down between 6 and 7 that undoes all the shit we spent 3 movies caring about           and by the end it’s the same place we were at the end of ep6: empire gone republic gotta rebuild single jedi starting a school same
2693,starwars,
2694,starwars,haha i thought it would be nice to give the playlist a little christmas spinif youre not an artist it can be quite difficult to understand copyright but in short his remixes are legal and he pays another company to handle the licenses
2695,starwars,maul looks like a 6-year-old who was forced to wear a suit to some fancy event
2696,starwars,with how polarizing this post is i cant tell if you are serious or sarcastic
2697,starwars,the only 2 reasons i dont like 7 are leias not very sarcastic or the same type of sarcasticand hans just got this now im the good guy i dont tow the line anymore
2698,starwars,ohhh this brings back so many memories 😍😭
2699,starwars,ok thanks
2700,starwars,ill probably watch rebels i have a hard time reading constant text
2701,starwars,jesus who would actually sit through hours and hours of shitty content before you get to the actual good sw movies just watch 4 - 6 and call it good the rest are trash
2702,starwars,could you resend your response i got the notification but it still hasnt loaded for me
2703,starwars,thats the point this occurance completely changed him an extremely traumatic event it wasnt jedi master luke skywalker it was hermit skywalker who was completely distraught by the fact that he alone is the reason for the rise of the dark side again
2704,starwars,cool
2705,starwars,cooli take it dont happen but it would have been awesome if he usurped palpatine for power of the empire
2706,starwars,what’s the change whats this drastic change that needs to be shown this seems pretty consistent with luke’s development in the ot
2707,starwars,wookiepedia
2708,starwars,yeah that’s basically how i feel the show just isn’t consistent in tone or quality it doesn’t compare to clone wars at all it basically ruins all cool scenes with a dumb moment or entire episodes being ruined because the focus is taken off of the interesting aspects of it twin suns is honestly such a boring episode and just shows how disappointing this show can be
2709,starwars,ok thanks
2710,starwars,but youre forgetting the important fact that shes a woman and because of that fact you should just blindly trust her every decision
2711,starwars,thanks he tuned out great took the anakin from the palpatines arrest set and added the hood
2712,starwars,excellent post you absolutely nailed it i think this has been pretty clear since tlj was released the mandalorian only served to support and reinforce that idea
2713,starwars,my main point is that too many major events transpired between 6 and 7 more than usual too much a whole trilogy worth           imagine episode 4 starting with darth vader giving up on palpatine too confusing and a bad idea
2714,starwars,rose pulled the schematic and pointed to the exact place it was
2715,starwars,yeaaaaa gonna need a series set before the force awakens with her as holdo and haley lu richardson as young leia
2716,starwars,if you want im open to it lay them out i personally dont lije 8 or 9 cause jj and rians in cohehisive story telling yeah its explained but very shittily
2717,starwars,sorry i’m glad for you that it has meaning but if anything this makes me hate ruin johnson even more
2718,starwars,nice i still have my b2 super battle droid in a box at my parents place   i love how you could squeeze a button on the back and it would explode into pieces
2719,starwars,the republic fell the empire took over it was the dark times for 30k years it was good             luke saved the galaxy restoring order            it was disney that decided to restart the cycle should’ve been about luke’s school facing a non-empire threat
2720,starwars,the jedi temple march anakin mini figure is badass dude👌🏼
2721,starwars,they live with their aunt and uncle they are proud
2722,starwars,thank you so much guys that was very useful info i’ve watched star wars my whole life but never really got into the nuts and bolts of it i’veonly read the republic commando series and that was freakin’ awesome
2723,starwars,personally i’ll be really disappointed if they pair luke up mark hamill said luke’s sexuality is supposed to be ambiguous
2724,starwars,yeah and im top of it my last girlfriend turned into the moon
2725,starwars,thanks
2726,starwars,and you killed it awesome work
2727,starwars,the first arc of tcw season seven has the answers you seek haven’t seen it since it first aired and i don’t really remember
2728,starwars,ok now this is funny
2729,starwars,i got my reasons you don’t sound like you need to hear them though
2730,starwars,this i vaguely remembered the name googled it along with signature as an image search thats him
2731,starwars,don’t recall the schematics part but finn knowing that isn’t even remotely absurd almost everyone’s worked on the supremacy at some point and yeah it’s convenient but not absurd that he would have worked on it and known of its tech
2732,starwars,the republic commando series was awesome
2733,starwars,if anyone from the sequel trilogy could realistically make an appearance in mando its poe dameron and i really hope we see these two together on screen in star wars one day
2734,starwars,dudei can not possible disagree with your statement
2735,starwars,this post is ridiculous ot fans have nothing to do with maga            im an ot fan and i’ve never touched meth once
2736,starwars,oh its so much fun this is all tongue and cheek and i was just being an idiot whose head over heels in love with star wars
2737,starwars,mom no 🥺
2738,starwars,im not ignoring that at all what youre not getting is that they did that *on purpose*theres an entire trilogy of vader hunting jedi and learning the dark side in between sith and new hope too but that wasnt the important part of his storyagain its what star wars has always done and they fill in the gaps with novels comics games and tv
2739,starwars,it says 50 cents but i didn’t buy any
2740,starwars,which is pretty much the cycle of star wars history same thing with old republic to republic to empire to new republic to whatever comes after kinda the point of the series its called star wars not star life simulator
2741,starwars,i was curious so i googled it only one ep was confirmed mid-december  too bad wouldnt been nice for a deeper dive like with s1
2742,starwars,that’s rough buddy
2743,starwars,i dont think that is going to happen there isnt much to flesh out for sequels prequels had 3 year war to explore what do sequels haveas for post tros well i believe we are getting a show above lukes order and i dont see them doing another one for reyand nothing post tros can get rid of the feeling that ot was pointless sequels happened no outside material can change those events
2744,starwars,right what an awful post
2745,starwars,id recommend watching rebels and reading the new canon thrawn novels to get a better understanding of him
2746,starwars,right i always assumed the 2008 series starts after the 2003 series ends but i did recently learn that its more complicated than that forgot that was one of a few things that were retconned
2747,starwars,my two brothers-in-law are ot purists but more along the lines of ‘there’s nothing else to consider’ the only reason they’d watch anything else is with me or my kids
2748,starwars,wow
2749,starwars,no and that’s a fairly stupid comparison honestly sure the st has a lot of haters but to assume it’s just the ot fans and that they are cult like and hate all other star wars including the pt which is becoming more loved as time goes on
2750,starwars,good bot
2751,starwars,the fact there are those of us who couldnt put this together from what they showed in tlj still baffles me no shade thrown im very glad youve connected these dots but ive imagined this scenario very similarly since seeing episode viii with time and more stories/cameos of luke at his height i think more fans will come around
2752,starwars,imo some of them dont admit all 9are somewhat chezzy in the same ways i like how some like a new hope and dont like tfa like if you liked a new hope you probably should like tfa to be honest
2753,starwars,fuck mitch mcconnell
2754,starwars,i raise you this
2755,starwars,i have the high ground
2756,starwars,maybe a better metaphor might be the prequel people who don’t realize that anakin’s story is a perfect metaphor for the alt right and then got us ix through their embodying the worst part of the sw fandom the ot purists are the mitch mcconnell’s enabling them for their own ends
2757,starwars,exactly
2758,starwars,because we dont know any of that for sure becausewe never saw it what is with this subreddit and just taking ones individual guesses as canon maube they say that in some new book i havent read but that just makes the movies worse jj is great for 3 min action scenes but of all people michael bay does a better job of tying together something he made jj had no ability to do so did the same with star trek
2759,starwars,&gt; multiple universes for a series is stupidsee star trek reboot
2760,starwars,oh boy
2761,starwars,wassaaaap
2762,starwars,thanks they are fixed - but i am building scenes like this from all the movies that can be placed in any order so far i’ve done episodes 1-6 about 12k pieces i’m onto the sequels now this is my youtube plays list on them: 
2763,starwars,“ i don’t really think in terms of universes or in terms of creating worlds or whatever that’s not that interesting to me”      rian johnson hollywood reporter                   lucas said continuity is for wimps source            entire intention of the series was a response to kathleen kennedy’s comments about 50 year old star wars fans being the only ones who care about luke skywalker so favreau wrote a story about 50 year old who is rescued by luke it’s a direct correlation “this is the way” implies the same thing as “this will begin to make things right” the first line of episode 7 it’s signaling
2764,starwars,aside from what people already said because it was supposed to be a continuation of 6 movie saga and yet it feels like bad remakenew characters are unrelatable and old ones dont really connect with the people they were in previous trilogy
2765,starwars,where’s dooku
2766,starwars,people keep equating animation with cartoons and then say cartoons are for kidsby that logic many live action movies and shows in the fantasy and/or action genre are 40% or more cartoon and these same people still enjoy those movies and shows just fine
2767,starwars,ah  most stormtroopers know that and keep schematics of starships on them  forgot that  whew  i was worried that might have been a plot hole probably good to keep intel from the person in charge
2768,starwars,well when anakin was younger he watched recordings of the battle between qui-gon and obi-wan against maul over and over again so it makes sense that hed mimick maul on mustafar since the recordings were pretty much burned into his brain at that point
2769,starwars,the jig is up
2770,starwars,he’s out there post-rotj that’s all we know so far
2771,starwars,i have a similar one that has the st on top the ot in the middle and the pt at the bottom got it with points from cinamarkor it might be the same poster i havent taken it out of the tube since i first got it
2772,starwars,wasn’t my comment but yeah pretty sexist to dislike her just because she has pink hair and a certain style my problem with her isn’t actually her my problem is that in order to make her work they had to turn poe into someone he’s not we never saw anything in tfa to suggest that he was anything close to a bitchy mutinous mansplainer they massacred a great character just to fit her in
2773,starwars,it still felt completely out of nowhere just as much as daenerys burning down king’s landing if there were buildup to these thingsnot foreshadowing then it would have been acceptable
2774,starwars,impressive
2775,starwars,that was included to explain why he didnt cough in his first 2003 *clone wars* appearance but its retconned by the 2008 series which has him coughing from the beginning
2776,starwars,i’m more optimistic than this i think in general newer content has been smoothing over inconsistencies rather than making things worse and i don’t think they’re just charging ahead without thinking about things like this
2777,starwars,i think bc he was a true war genius he was eerily calm collected calculating deeply personal etc he’d sacrifice a fleet to put what he wants where he wants it not a dark force wielder but cold hearted one of the best villains by recipe
2778,starwars,yeah hopefully this is a dimension where luke skywalker doesn’t become a sad sack of green milk   hopefully in this dimension when season 3 comes out of the madelorain he marries mara jade or hell i’d even be fine with him marrying ahsoka tano and him finding peace with himself and becoming wise jedi master
2779,starwars,you’re completely ignoring the fact that an entire trilogy of material takes place between 6 and 7
2780,starwars,i seee thank you all for your suggestions appreciate it i think i would go read light of the jedi first and see how it goes if i really like it id buy into the dark besides theres only hardback covers so far so i aint buying that
2781,starwars,read *heir to the empire*
2782,starwars,the prophecy was stupid it took a moment all about the power of family and redemption and turned it into the destiny of the universe
2783,starwars,season 1 and 2 are actually great i find season 3 and even 4 have more filler episodes
2784,starwars,&gt;rian admittedly doesn’t care about lore and really doesn’t feel any problem in making luke give up on the galaxy i don’t trust him with star wars anymorerians never said that lucas however said continuity is for wimps so and jj made luke give up; rian just had to transition him back from he walked away from everything to the jedi master he *returned* luke you might say&gt;and introducing a powerful force user after return of the jedi was absolutely 100% setting up luke’s returnit certainly wasnt the *entire intention* of the series
2785,starwars,&gt;the chosen one only became a concept after tpm did it notyes tpm created the chosen one prophecy and thats exactly my point it retroactively made anakin the most important character in the series when it was originally luke and that doesnt gel with the ot when its clearly meant for luke to be the important character &gt;and imo luke isnt hope blowing up the death star was the hope it showed that the rebellion had a chance to fight back no matter if luke of biggs or whoever made the shotwell yes thats hope for the rebellion but the title a new hope is in reference objectively to luke its said in dialogue throughout the movies &gt;people tend to forget that star wars started as only anh and only went on due to the populairity of this movie as far as i remember there was no multiple movie deal thats why esb starts so abruptly with a time skipi didnt forget but that sort of works towards my point that there isnt perfect flow between the movies like the op suggests george wrote on the fly somethings he had planned many he didnt and others he changed even in the ot he retcons quite a few of his own ideas but then in the prequels he doubles down on the retcons and thats fine it doesnt really bother me and i enjoy all of the movies but pretending that these movies are consistent and flow to each other is not really accurate and thats why it bothers me that the sequels adding things changing things etc bothers so many people when george started doing that with his 2nd movie and never stopped through his 6th movieif you have problems with the actual content thats fine but propping up the prequels as these consistent stories that flow perfectly with the originals where the new movies dont thats just not really that fair to say like i understand that are a lot of people in the prequels good sequels bad camp but i think some of that mentality puts blinders on and they praise aspects of one but not the other and then hate on aspects of one but not the other both have good and bad
2786,starwars,mostly my own work - for the darth vader scene there is part of the official transformation set in there but the rest is just what i came up with after a lot of trial and error 👍
2787,starwars,yeah i’m an idiot looked at this half asleep last night
2788,starwars,you know full well it’s not going to be one night only
2789,starwars,and then it turned out that obi wan didn’t actually defeat maul because they brought him back to life after being cut in half trash there are never any stakes because death is meaningless in star wars
2790,starwars,that was really interesting and now ive gone down a youtube rabbit hole of watching fencing competitions
2791,starwars,same i managed to get through clone wars long enough so that my brain could adjust tolerate the art style and enjoy the amazing journey towards the series end the character models got more detailed and generally acceptable while all non character related animations were amazing from the beginning but rebels is whole different beast i just cant relate or emphasise to anyone on this show 
2792,starwars,he sounds interesting then but i take it he dont make it to episode 7
2793,starwars,i hope they restocked it since then
2794,starwars,this is super cool can the four scenes detach so you can line them up chronologically
2795,starwars,i remember collecting the pepsi cans with all the episode one characters on them had the whole set displayed in my room for years and years left for university and mom recycled them sad day 😥
2796,starwars,thanks 🙏👍
2797,starwars,i think there is a difference between anakin and lukethere isnt much character development for anakin in original just some vague obi-wans description with luke we had 3 movies of character development that seemed to dissappear in sequels
2798,starwars,this isnt ambition its a hobby ambition would be to scrape these hunks of paper and glue and try again its a start but thats about it
2799,starwars,source
2800,starwars,thanks again 👍 i cover some of that in the youtube video of this build - check out my profile 👍👍
2801,starwars,
2802,starwars,the real question is if the soda is still sold at 1999 prices
2803,starwars,those are really sweet  i will say the one with maul looks a lot like the old obama “hope” posters -i think because the side is blue and the use of shadows  you should totally put “hope” in all caps and a font with no serifs and we can use it when asked about our political ideologies
2804,starwars,he’s all about strategy and deduction think sherlock holmes meets tarkin he’s also one of the very few compelling imperial characters they’ve given us
2805,starwars,yes
2806,starwars,hes actually a cyborg he was a fully living being at one point but got in a major accident and was augmented with technology to survive mace windu tried to crush his remaining organs with the force which is why hes got that constant wheezing
2807,starwars,awesome are these different sets you put together
2808,starwars,rian admittedly doesn’t care about lore and really doesn’t feel any problem in making luke give up on the galaxy i don’t trust him with star wars anymore            and introducing a powerful force user after return of the jedi was *absolutely 100%* setting up luke’s return
2809,starwars,the old eu now legends has a chronological timeline in the front of every book you can also try wookieepedia i know they have a list of novels by release date at least
2810,starwars,1	split up since the empire is only tracking one ship with one of theirs 2	send ships for fuel since again the empire can either follow them or you 3	ram them with the support ships before they run out of fuel4	evacuate everyone with multiple trips using transport ships it doesn’t matter if they see you do it they can only track one of you with one of their shipsholdo’s “let’s hope they don’t notice” plan would have saved them but only if the empire actually didn’t actually notice&gt;	and yes poe doesn’t get to know the plan just because he wants tonot telling your subordinates not only what the plan is but that you have a plan to begin with is a mark of terrible leadership she even says she likes poe at the end so what possible justification did she have for not telling him all she had to do was say “of course there’s a plan” and that conflict goes out the airlock with akbar
2811,starwars,honestly palpatine was the one that choose all the anesthetics  so i am guessing it is smaller then his
2812,starwars,it depends on whats age range of the word kids in your opinion i dont think there are many 10 year olds who watch dora for example i believe a good kid show is actually a synonym to a family show that it appeals to kids of all ages and also adults at the same time
2813,starwars,what these are still around
2814,starwars,i think ashoka surviving takes off some of the emotional  impactthey havent done anithyng yet with the world between worlds so for me it personally it just dumb plot convinience
2815,starwars,well it wasnt episode 4 until laterand im sorry but star wars has always had a ton of story left outthey had to have an entire cartoon series to show the clone wars because ep ii only shows the beginning of the war and ep iii shows the endand theres 10 years in between tpm and aotcand what about between esb and rotj luke got his lightsaber and made himself into a jedi in between episodes wheres your outrage for thatyoure complaining about something thats a storytelling feature of sw not a flawtheres plenty you could bitch about the sequels but a time jump and events in between episodes is a weak case
2816,starwars,star wars very much only acknowledges grief when it happens to be convenient to the story luke’s adopted parents due let’s do some lightsaber training with old ben a few hours later and never mention it again leia’s entire planet gets blown up let’s have a nice award ceremony and never mention it againpretty much the only time we do see someone go through actual grief is anakin with his mother which eventually leads to him turning to the dark sideso yeah pretty far off from how actual normal human emotions work but still lots of fun so whatever
2817,starwars,he was written the way he was because that was georges original vision and they wanted to continue lukes story the way it was intendedrian johnson and dave filoni collaborated on tlj and rian is the one who convinced dave to work on the mandalorian in the first place
2818,starwars,love legos and i love this can’t wait to see what you make next we will be watching your career with great interest
2819,starwars,ok thx
2820,starwars,he’s a cyborg he wanted to be modified why he also has a heart that obi wan targets in revenge of the sith most of his organs are still present in the original clone wars animation mace crushes his chest with the force resulting in him coughing
2821,starwars,this is incredible rots is my all time favorite star wars movie so this is the coolest lego set ive ever seen
2822,starwars,he is a cyborg not a robot
2823,starwars,chewpio and 3pac
2824,starwars,hes not a robot hes a cyborg hes got organic organs which is what obi-wan shoots to kill him
2825,starwars,yep rians a star wars fan who grew up on luke too again you not liking the presentation doesnt mean one groups true fans and one group isntand you think the *entire intention* of the series was just for a quick cameo at the end of its second season
2826,starwars,you can really tell who it was intended for clone wars was very kiddy too but clone wars learned to grow up over time
2827,starwars,i can say the same to you practice what you preach
2828,starwars,new coruscant republic
2829,starwars,jesus died for *all* our sins if you believe that sort of thing then 30 years later another jesus appea- oh wait here’s another and another            no rey was superfluous
2830,starwars,thats so dopedoes he get licencing for the star wars songs or are they different enough i dont know enough about copywright but it seems like a grey areaalso and dont take this the wrong way but what is a jingle bells song doing on a star wars playlist xd
2831,starwars,i know they are a thing at least during the crusaders but in the current timeline mandalorian is associated with people from mandalore or those descended from them i was curious if it’s possible for maybe a free navy of mandalorian crusaders that survive by stay on the edge of known space as smoke and rumors getting recruited to take mandalore and rebuild the glory of the mandalorian people
2832,starwars,some but not necessarily chronologically ive played most before i also use audiobooks for as many as i can there are some on youtube and lots on audible i habe to say so far my favorites have been plagius and the clone commando series best of luck mtfbwy ps some of the books are slow but bare with it lol
2833,starwars,the courtship of princess leia is a prime example i couldnt finish it
2834,starwars,i fucking love star wars
2835,starwars,i know people are stupid i resisted watching the show for a long time because i was turned off by the style of the animation but i got over that pretty fast it really is an excellent show far better than any of the movies with the exception of rogue one and the empire strikes back  lucas was always saying that he views star wars as a kids show whenever adults would complain about how crappy the movies were well it’s ironic that the cartoons deal with the subject matter and story of star wars in a far more compelling and exciting way than the movies did  i never really thought vader was that scary or tragic except for the end of rogue one which shows you how powerful and terrifying he could be the clone wars does an excellent job of making you care about annakin in ways the movies fail at and so when they come to an end and annakin becomes vader you really do get a sense of how tragic it was  and speaking of scarythe ending of jedi fallen order did an even better job of showing you just how powerful terrifying and ruthless vader was his fight with asoka in that episode was chilling and very sad and when his mask was damaged and you hear him speak both in his normal voice and the voice of vadergives me the chills every time i watch it that’s what i loved about those two series they were made by people who love star wars and see its potential for great storytelling and they delivered
2836,starwars,because we all know that once jesus died all evil was sucked from the world down a big metaphysical drain and we never required heroes again
2837,starwars,i went into rebels with a bit of a bias i had just finished tcw and i had heard that rebels wasnt that great in comparison especially the animation style so i wasnt expecting muchbut my bias was gone very quicklythe style didnt bother me at all and there are some great characters in rebels each with significant arcs and growthboth on the rebel side and on the imperial sidei like how ezra keeps his scars and seems to grow as a character as well as the team that keeps expandingi havent finished rebels yet but i plan to do so im looking forward to it
2838,starwars,i have the same set at home still in cling film
2839,starwars,the sequel duels bury the prequel duels the duels in the prequels are laughable garbage
2840,starwars,this is beautiful
2841,starwars,they called a new hope “episode 4”  because of all the backstory implied i’m saying part 7 of a story doesn’t have that same defense             yes i know a new hope didn’t always have an episode number b it when they did they chose 4 to acknowledge the previous chapters 7 doesn’t do that 8 requires flashbacks wtf and 9 bring palpatine back off screen
2842,starwars,poe gets people killed at the dreadnaught in the process of killing the dreadnaught he gets people killed enacting his plan to save everyone which is sabotaged by rose’s inept parking skills he gets people killed rushing the door breaching laser on crait under leia’a orders which only fails because rose sabotaged it again of these three points where is poe a bad leader we agreed that the first one produced a positive result the second one only happened because poe wasn’t given any information and the people he sent were dumb the third one was sabotaged against him and again that was sanctioned by leia am i forgetting something it seems like at every junction poe made the best decision he could with what he had
2843,starwars,i think so i guarantee they are going to add context with the streaming shows and then they’ll re-edit and re-release viii and ix to fix the problems with the canonthat’s probably what the agreement between hamill and disney was about he’s probably going to do some luke/grogu scenes that will be added to viii
2844,starwars,unfortunately there’s a lot of misogyny both in this thread and in the community criticising her hair the way she dresses in star wars it’s nonsensical there’s gotta be a line to what you criticise
2845,starwars,at the same time luke only goes to him because he recognizes the last name and wonders if theyre related maybe its specifically so luke would seek him out if he ever happened to get a message for obi-wan kenobiidk theres probably a 6000 word wookieepedia page about this despite the actual reason just being that lucas didnt think about it too hard
2846,starwars,roowrr wut r u doin step-wookie
2847,starwars,rebels isn’t a bad show just imo clone wars is leagues above it
2848,starwars,ah come on dude dont be putting others down for being ambitious
2849,starwars,i don’t think they’ve acknowledged it yet
2850,starwars,non-human mandos are a thing though uncommon as far as i’m aware i remember a legends thing about mando civilization being founded by some non-humans so that would be cool
2851,starwars,nope i only made the last track - the jingle bells remixi do know closed on sunday tho i did another song with him  sonic theme remix
2852,starwars,this is the most unfairly hated scene in the prequels when i watched it in the theater in 2005 the whole context was that both of them know each other so well and both fought so passionately led by the force that at some point after long ass duel their instincts just gave up and went full defensive mode you totally get it while watching the scene this was so badass and cool i enjoyed the hell out of this momentyeah without the context and cut down to those two seconds the loop looks funny and stupid
2853,starwars,favreau and filoni are star wars fans            they grew up on luke            kennedy made a divisive luke            favreau and filoni worked on clone wars but they make a show takes place after the ot             because the entire time they’re setting up luke’s return          as soon as they introduced baby yoda the shows true intention was revealed; reintroduce luke via baby yoda
2854,starwars,np
2855,starwars,i get that to an extent yeah bitch is kinda thrown around a lot without it being gendered i just saw a lot of comments criticising her hair and her dress and whatever and associated your comment with that sorry about that what i would say i think a lot of the film is about fleshing out the resistance beyond the characters we know leia is  for a lot of the action and though we expect command to fall to poe because we know him we’re taught it doesn’t actually work that way; there’s a larger story at play with other characters that we haven’t met yet but are still important moreover holdo knows little about poe besides the fact he’s just been demoted for his actions against the dreadnought - he succeeded but at a cost so great the resistance struggles to survive it given survival is the key under holdo she makes it her sole focus even at the expense of transparency it makes us dislike her but that’s the point she makes a tough call one that we don’t get to understand until poe does so that we join his journey of character development from loveable-but-reckless hero to a true leader of the resistance and a protege of leia so yeah for me anyway holdo was cagey but she had to be like that so the resistance could survive it’s messy it’s infuriating we side with the character we know until we and poe learned she not only had a plan but a reason for keeping it secret the last jedi is challenging it’s the most challenging star wars film because it goes against what we expect at a lot of times i love the film for that i get why others don’t but i don’t get a lot of the outright hatred the characters actors and rian himself gets for it
2856,starwars,exactly and then when those fans were told they are whiners that all fueled the divide around the sequels
2857,starwars,to be fair a new hope has the entirety of the prequels story baked into it without showing any of it and it was like that for 22 yearsstarting in the middle of the story is literally what star wars has done since the very beginning
2858,starwars,
2859,starwars,they’re mad that general audiences like the sequels more than their prequels
2860,starwars,yeah but what if he didnt know obiwan was behind him
2861,starwars,
2862,starwars,will do and i read aftermath a few years ago after force awakens i think do you know what the thrawn reading order is
2863,starwars,someone else trying to explain why it’s okay that they butchered luke’s charactersorry but no i’m glad you like the movie but for me what we saw just wasn’t luke skywalker
2864,starwars,bingo
2865,starwars,go look at filonis comments about tlj luke in *the art of tros* he gets itluke returned proves absolutely nothing so what he showed up in a tv show set 25 years prior that means they hate tlj does it youve got a real gap in your logic there
2866,starwars,has anyone else had a serious bug where the video goes black on dantooine at the start of the defense of the government building after learning about the jedi it was my second stop for some reason when i found the jedi it wouldn’t let me initiate conversation or unlock his holding cell then when the battle was supposed to start it just went black i was still able to access the menu and tried to reload multiple times without success wondering if you need to complete and missions/planets in a certain order to avoid bugs
2867,starwars,release order is probably bestchronological actually is good too which is 1 2 the clone wars cartoon movie then tv show episode 3 rebels tv show solo movie rogue one movie 4 5 6 then mandolorianafter that you are in sequel territory resistance tv show is mediocre and 789 movies were saltierthancrait
2868,starwars,his new empire
2869,starwars,he also kills the ones which theoretically would be enough to bring balance as the son stoked the darkside and the daughter was neutral the jedi added the part about destroying the sith the balance is obtained when power is equal on both sides neither can have to much power the jedi had to much power he destroyed them then he destroys the sith  rey and ben become the new balance  then rey herself maintains the balance by being neither jedi or sith along with asoka assuming she is still alive at the time
2870,starwars,i guess technically you should really clone yourself
2871,starwars,what is the problem with reddit  everytime i upload the images  they are always of low quality  i just cant help it
2872,starwars,thoroughly deserved pal only suggestion i could give you is to always declare which set you started from or took bricks from number of bricks used where did you get the minifigures from you know that kind of stuff for those whod like to reproduce it
2873,starwars,they didn’t finn did and the specifically didn’t tell holdo that or their plan
2874,starwars,the darkside will rise again again after tros  balance is never permanent  anakin/vader indeed brought balance to the force
2875,starwars,epic 😍
2876,starwars,well i would love it if ashoka or the other shows hints at that with the remnant slowly losing and losing the actually competent and dangerous leaders and the wreckage of that became the first order like nazi germany great technology but leadership absolute thrash
2877,starwars,i wonder how they explain his coughing now
2878,starwars,yes
2879,starwars,who left the fridge open
2880,starwars,your points make no sense:for one nobody said holdo thought poe was the mole they said she was afraid there was a mole and considering poes first reaction in his arc is always to go ask for help to people around him word of her plan could trickle down to a potential mole if she starts telling it to non-essential personnel in its execution like poe a fighter pilot with no fighter to pilotsecond theres such a thing as escape pods we see them and rose is guarding with a power tool but a mole would probably shoot her to be safe anyway also it wouldnt be out of character for the first order to promise rescue to a mole inside the raddus then blow up the ship without a care because why bother
2881,starwars,right my point is there’d be no need to give luke a heroic return if he wasn’t written the way he was in tlj            they fixed him because they love luke the only reason favreau introduced baby yoda in the first place was to introduce luke
2882,starwars,agreed i absolutely love the prequels i grew up on them and they still bring me loads of joy however i don’t have to try and justify every dumb moment eg this scene palp killing saesee tinn and agen kolar so easily padme death to justify liking them
2883,starwars,i read the whole thread pretty much 90% of the people talking shit about the movie are giving a detailed paragraph sized argument about it and being reasonable so when someone says lots of irrational hate you think thats a good characterization who is being irrational who is being hateful i hear this same thing in every thread on this sub at this point its just a way to delegitimize any criticism of the movie because people are overly sensitive and thats boring
2884,starwars,*facepalm* its not malak its vader just realized you can see his chin whoops
2885,starwars,doesn’t seem to be a lightsaber but instead a vibroblade which uses a physical blade
2886,starwars,well i would love it if ashoka or the other shows hints at that with the remnant slowly losing and losing the actually competent and dangerous leaders and the wreckage of that became the first order like nazi germany great technology but leadership absolute thrash
2887,starwars,i wish we’d’ve gotten to see threepio and chewie speaking privately *in* his native tongue i imagine chewie always appreciated threepio for that getting to hear his native language if only from a foppish protocol droid
2888,starwars,in essence when you think about it han solo is the space equivalent of an independent truck driver
2889,starwars,# more art on my twitter# buy me a ko-fi
2890,starwars,although i 100% agree with you about star wars’ target audience i would only argue that toys are not exactly a great indicator of the target audience remember that the 80’s and 90’s brought us robocop and terminator toys
2891,starwars,4 5 6rest of them are trash so dont watch them
2892,starwars,in order from left to right: count dooku darth sidious darth maul darth vader darth nihilus darth malgus darth plageueis darth revan asajj ventress
2893,starwars,and what im saying is that those arent openings to a jedi because they have the ability to sense it coming and respond whereas a regular person would not and depending on the angle of deflection the counter can be lethal this is heightened during this duel because of their familiarity with one another
2894,starwars,why would she and im sure they wont really make that connection
2895,starwars,the argument isnt which is worse between the sequel films all im saying is i hated everything tlj did that it made the 3rd film in the trilogy bad by default simply adds to my dislike for it
2896,starwars,cool nice work and thanks for the reply
2897,starwars,or that time anakin just straight up took a fireball into his face and was walking not 2/3days after when rescueing secura
2898,starwars,thats incredible 
2899,starwars,can you prove they liked it i can prove they didn’t          they made luke return
2900,starwars,huh i think we actually agree that the sub is populated with “sequel bad” fans to the point that saying otherwise gets downvoted when i first read your comment i thought you wanted them to elaborate because you agreed not because the original comment was just an opinion with no substance so yeah i’m sorry i misinterpreted your comment you’re right to push them for more substance you’re just as tired of some of the comments here as i am sorry for not understanding you’re meaning and becoming belligerent the amount of hate new female characters get in this reddit seriously irritates me sometimes i was on a bit of a warpath and i attacked you when i shouldn’t have long story short i’m sorry my dude happy new year to you
2901,starwars,i think its very clear by now that they wont go that way
2902,starwars,dope as hell
2903,starwars,they probably had the same reasoning as the post above and know exactly how to translate this to screenthis has already been hinted at and addressed in non-live action canon material like books and comicsi encourage you to read ops post again this is very likely what filoni and favreau are headed towards in live action
2904,starwars,if youre going to develop this drastic change in luke skywalker as he appears in tlj youre gonna need to dedicate an entire movie to this character arc tlj gives us about a 1-2 minute explanation for why luke is the way he iswhile most of what your wrote is implied by the dialogue in tlj all of that development and turmoil happens off-screen what do most people who hate tlj say if youre going to change lukes character *show us* show us how he got there because this drastic of a change needs a drastic justification
2905,starwars,youd be wrong just because *you* dont like lukes presentation in tlj doesnt mean other fans dont
2906,starwars,the way ive heard it explained is ya books focus on ya character/s which are intended to resonate more with a ya audience it doesnt mean it wont be enjoyable for you or other age groups just that the focus and conflicts they might face are more oriented to this time in our lives  the jr novel is likely for a younger group but i imagine it will still be a great story
2907,starwars,i dont really see boba leading a squad of stormtroopers
2908,starwars,they’re clearly using mando to bridge from the ot to the sequels that was hinted in season 1 and made abundantly clear in season 2 they’re not making multiple universes they never were the only version of that in sw is legends and they specifically created the legends designation so that they could have one unified storyline not so they could further divide it
2909,starwars,and you are using predestination as an easy out for violence  this non sequitur about ai and the brain is misdirection avoiding the specific situation of anakin skywalker  so let me put this simply:someone who was led astray tempted with power to save those he loves and neglected by those who were supposed to care for his upbringing has no right to take the lives of *innocent people* i applaud you for trying so hard to change the argument and make this a discussion about privilege but we are not having a conversation about that as badly as you want to set up that straw man  so are you saying anakin had no choice  slaughtering the children was admissible because he was so mistreated  force choking his pregnant wife was an understandable reaction  gods help you
2910,starwars,yes but please make sure to find a list of all episodes plus the movie in a chronological order since these episodes can get really confusing for the first 1-3 seasons
2911,starwars,made less sense to the overall story a powerful force user corrupts luke and ben *in between* episodes bad star wars things like that don’t happen in between episodes they’re supposed to follow each other and cover the big stuff the way it is now requires a whole trilogy to explain the in between
2912,starwars,this describes it perfectly
2913,starwars,actually love this you made the songs
2914,starwars,luke is tied with anakin for my favorite character in the saga and this was hilariousit’s similar to a 9 year old boy hopping into a spaceship that he has never flown before and isn’t even familiar with he struggles with controls multiple times flies off into a space battle ends up inside the droid control ship accidentally blows it up and escapesand i love every second of it
2915,starwars,
2916,starwars,ive done all of those except the far left and far rightyou are missing the first book of aftermath it looks likethe thrawn books are at 10/10 imothe rebels book is decent but i think its the weakest of the ones i readafter you are done those pick up battlefront twighlight company and lost stars
2917,starwars,anyone else think dooku would make a good lord mountbatten
2918,starwars,lol tros made every bad and dumb decision it possibly could have
2919,starwars,well the idea would be to parry their attack and keep pressure on their blade and quickly use the contact point as like a pivot to just flick your wrist down as long as you maintain contact you can easily come back up to defend if they try to disengage and attack you
2920,starwars,like jesus and the lil jesus :/
2921,starwars,can’t knock honest work
2922,starwars,jesus this is a lame post  get a life
2923,starwars,the chosen one only became a concept after tpm did it not and imo luke isnt hope blowing up the death star was the hope it showed that the rebellion had a chance to fight back no matter if luke of biggs or whoever made the shot people tend to forget that star wars started as only anh and only went on due to the populairity of this movie as far as i remember there was no multiple movie deal thats why esb starts so abruptly with a time skip but i do agree with you on how the pacing in the prequals went a bit too rough but tcw did fix a lot in regards of explaining the chosen one and the fall of anakin espaically the later seasons
2924,starwars,mid left is darth malgus
2925,starwars,it also makes a big point the empire became an empire not through competence in military or administration the sith lord was just cunning and overpowered he has no skills in those other matters
2926,starwars,which is one of the things that isnt believable for me and destroyes that part of the story completely - which is also something i hope the mandalorian will clear up there is also only a very limited amount of ways that remnant will become the first order battlefront 2 does a crappy job explaining it - that remnant cant become the first order that way it defies every bit of logic
2927,starwars,the father isnt quite a god but has found perfect balance within the force and unlocked all that lies within the force itself the son perfect mastery of the dark side the daughter same for the light the father is literally just keeping his kids in checkarguably id say anakin was actually stronger than the father but had lesser knowledge
2928,starwars,456–123–789i’ve seen them so many times that now i watch them in storyline order along with all the spin offs and series togetherafter the 9 core movies watch rogue onetakes place before 3-4 and solo3-4 alsomandolorian is fantastic and season 2 just finished if you really want to get into the story after those watch clone wars then rebels
2929,starwars,the universe is in the same spot it was at the end of ep6 empire gone new republic picks up pieces lone jedi must train newbies same
2930,starwars,i agree - but full disclaimer i’m a pretty casual fan i like most of the movies with the exception of episode 3 finally got disney+ and was super excited to start it first episodethought “how generic can this get” second episode found to be okay but nothing special then the third i found to be laughably bad when mando went in to rescue the child i think my least favorite part of it all is that mando is not an interesting character nor does he seem like this badass lone wolf bounty hunter i expected i’m trying to give it a few more episodes but my hopes have been significantly lowered
2931,starwars,darth plagueis sidiouss master have you ever heard of the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise
2932,starwars,👍
2933,starwars,both really it suggests the intended reading age but half of ya readers are adults i dont really see any meaningful difference between something like *lost stars* and an adult novel in terms of quality or its worthid start with *light* and see what you think if you want to read more about the era go for *into the dark*
2934,starwars,a hard one as of right now it’s:he would have saved the galaxy but was stopped by a force wielder not a jedi
2935,starwars,multiple universes for a series is stupidthey can explain away the entirety of the sequel trilogy by it being not only a short time but claiming only a few major planets actually join the new republicwe learn in aftermath the new republic doesnt control nearly as much as was expected and even coroscant in the canon lore is still under empire control and doesnt look like it changes even during rise of skywalkerits basically chandrilla mon calamari and a few other planets are the new republicwe could also say the new republic fell apart after the first attack by the orderso at the end of rise of skywalker we could literally have warlords and small factions instead of a unified republic its basically an open book
2936,starwars,
2937,starwars,i follow this guy he is op if you look at his account he has a bunch of other ones
2938,starwars,yes good point i always wondered if palpatine was somehow masking the true depths of it from them somehow stopping them from seeing what it meant but idk - it is something that needs to be addressed i think
2939,starwars,wouldnt it be unwise to do so wouldnt you leave your head exposed by sliding your blade your only line of defense down to their fingers
2940,starwars,am i missing something is malak hiding somewhere
2941,starwars,everything’s flawed but again i’m wondering what you’re trying to do it seems like you’re describing new hope in the least flattering way possible in order to suggest we shouldn’t criticise the other films if they don’t live up to the same standardand i know you had a honey tone but you also made a serious point i’m responding to the serious point and i think it’s deeply flawed
2942,starwars,i see so whats the difference between a normal novel junior novel and a young-readers novel are they suppose to highlight the age demographic or its more of a type of novel and do you think i should buy all 3 books or just 1 or 2
2943,starwars,he’s a good kid who was the product of his environmentstarted life as a slave and the religious cult who was supposed to take care of him used him as a weapon in a pointless warhe was made a “general” with all the responsibilities and heavy decisions at an age where most kids are still in collegehow does a fundamentally good person help build a death star ask the people who taught him it was alright to grow human beings to be used for cannon fodderand it’s just a movie we can cheer for and like characters regardless it’s not like anakin actually killed a real human being
2944,starwars,that’s just not true at all the men who made the return of luke absolutely did not enjoy how luke was handled in tlj it’s simply isn’t possible
2945,starwars,yeah the score is consistently great everything else is just an utter mess i dont blame any of the actors either to be honest the script direction and lack of an environment to give context and mise en scene to sequences is clear in each of the films
2946,starwars,if they thought tracking through hyperspace wasn’t possible then how did they know exactly where the hyperspace tracker was on the ship  like they ever had schematics
2947,starwars,i knew you would say that you only ever spoke to me directlyeveryone in this sub is so dumb on every tlj topicyou said this before i clicked on this thread tros and tlj are poor films but tros was fucked from the start because it had to pick up the shattered pieces tlj left it with it did the best it could but it was always doomed tlj was shit despite having loads of potential to play with thats the difference ps: i dont care if you respect me or my opinion your anonymous insults me nothing to anyone keep them to yourself
2948,starwars,here’s a post i made around halloween of it 
2949,starwars,
2950,starwars,damn i just gave away my silver award
2951,starwars,knights of ren would be sick honestly like a backstory for them and ren himself
2952,starwars,let them cry
2953,starwars,my friend thinks boba led the attack on the farm  vader tells him no disintegrations and this is the only scene that we actually see a disintegration
2954,starwars,actually anakin killed a lot of innocent people tuskens early on in their housesjedi council and obi wan completely failed to see the dark side in that and padme was told too and did nothing huge plot failure
2955,starwars,no problemo thanks for the cool wallpaper
2956,starwars,cool i didn’t know that 👍
2957,starwars,
2958,starwars,glad you enjoyed them welcome to the fandom for me it’s my opinion changes often tho honestly:3 4 r1 5 6 2 solo 1 9 8 7
2959,starwars,thanks for the awesome comment dude i appreciate it and never stop collecting 👍
2960,starwars,haha its what marvel has printed on the cover
2961,starwars,wishes these movies will go away 
2962,starwars,midi-chlorian it doesnt mean a great deal to the prophecy itself; the fact he was apparently born of the force is more relevant but neither of them mean the prophecy had to pan out as the jedi expected
2963,starwars,haha yeah i can’t convince my wife either maybe my 5 year old can convince her
2964,starwars,this looks amazing
2965,starwars,yeah they do they ask you if it’s to any existing licensed series just to clarify if they need to buy licensing or not
2966,starwars,i’m planning on it have one for the blue mando but just finished making the boba fett ones and veteran ranger a couple days ago
2967,starwars,i know a few folks have said the same but i have the temple march which happens just before and it wouldn’t feel right building a scene with dead kids 😲👍
2968,starwars,you remember why the fo was able to discover their ships in the first place right
2969,starwars,head canoni like that
2970,starwars,
2971,starwars,this is one of the most beautiful things ive layed my eyes upon ive been collecting star wars lego since i was very young toddler in 1999 and rots is my favorite film - this ties those two together perfectly i need to get to work bravo
2972,starwars,just take my upvote man stunning work
2973,starwars,yep sad
2974,starwars,what’s wrong with a kids show anyone can be a kid 😉
2975,starwars,oh ok sorry for being very hard on me down voting but i understand hope the vader mask will look good when u do it
2976,starwars,oh grow up star wars is still a good film and its still extremely silly this was just me poking fun at what i love and understanding that its been ridiculous and inconsistent from the start but youre already here to jump on the hate bandwagon and take things to a serious level on a post that is anything but serious have fun laugh  understand that star wars is and always has been flawed  youll enjoy it a lot more i promise
2977,starwars,i like how malak looks a bit mournful or wistful but malgus is head on looking for who dares oppose him
2978,starwars,loli had the same thought  it took me years to convince my wife that i had to get the millennium falcon setidk if i’ll have the same success convincing her that i need 6 of these
2979,starwars,thanks pretty sure they don’t take star wars submissions but appreciate the thought 👍
2980,starwars,thanks for the recipe ill have to give a go for sure
2981,starwars,whatever dude
2982,starwars,its cool im just pulling your leg
2983,starwars,it made more money than the prequels tho
2984,starwars,good jobbutmissing the child killing : 
2985,starwars,*a test of courage* is a junior novel and *into the dark* is young-readers theyre all part of the same overall storyline that *light of the jedi* is also part ofid also point out that the young-reader books are among the best works in star wars canon so far especially claudia grays previous stories like *lost stars* it shouldnt be equated to a lack of quality
2986,starwars,haha not a bad thing to dream about lol i like the ways the ears came out its a great idea theyre very cute i may have to try my hand as well
2987,starwars,sorry bet they got good grip
2988,starwars,thanks
2989,starwars,the fucking mental gymnastics prequel fans go to in order to defend this is astounding
2990,starwars,freedom of art it is
2991,starwars,theyre robotic
2992,starwars,the score is the one thing about the prequels that i can say im definitely a fan of but its the only thing holding the rest together
2993,starwars,3p0
2994,starwars,no i’ve only talked to you directly not everyone who doesn’t like the movie “the logic of star wars so far” is code for “the same exact story told again”and if you earnestly think tros is better than tlj i have even less respect for your opinion
2995,starwars,the ultimate one is my goal too if i had a lot of money i’d get 6 sets so i could do all 3 and the ultimate haha
2996,starwars,me: 2021 is going to be greatat-at has entered the chat
2997,starwars,no see there is definitely more good than bad in the sequel trilogy finn and rose were not done well and i dont enjoy them through out the films but now we have badasses like po and kylo renn and then people say rey is a mary sue but is she really constantly struggling with where she comes from and finally gets the heartbreaking truth her story arc isnt as much as becoming a jedi its more about finding herself and her place in the galaxy which happens to be as a jedi and cmon palatines return proving that he knew the secret of how to cheat death and is still in the process of perfecting it like snoke who was palatine all along like come on how can you say that that isnt epic
2998,starwars,really nice well done any chance of you uploading the images  in the highest quality so i can use it as a wallpaperthanks
2999,starwars,this is all so awesome and wholesome my daughter got me a dadalorian shirt and i love it have fun
3000,starwars,then well just call it freedom of art : he really looks worst in that scene
3001,starwars,he sure wasn’t using the light side when he slaughtered those tusken raiders
3002,starwars,put this on lego ideas i would support it
3003,starwars,i would purchase prints
3004,starwars,life is tough
3005,starwars,this face screams “well i don’t approve” in response to qui-gon’s “the queen does not need to know”
3006,starwars,im often told im a hater for enjoying the hermit side of luke i thought it was equivalent to fat thor but for some reason being fat is more acceptable than depression anger and resentment
3007,starwars,if they had called the show ben kenobi then there would still be a large amount of people asking who ben kenobi isyoutube would be flooded with ben kenobi name explained videosreferring to him with the name most people know him by is better for marketing purposesits the same as referring to aragorn as strider
3008,starwars,
3009,starwars,sure but nothing stated that and personally i dont really see the use in a prophecy that removes evil for all time from an ongoing franchiseanakin did his thing fulfilled the prophecy but more importantly redeemed himself by saving his son and whatever happens after is a bonus
3010,starwars,maybe john williams is doing the majority of the heavy lifting for owen and beru but there is absolutely an extended reaction of luke reacting to his aunt and uncle dying  instead of breaking down though the scene is about him getting the resolve to go fight the empireowen and beru probably were shot and then their bodies burned to a crisp
3011,starwars,its style over substance theres so many issues with the prequels but the ridiculous lightsabre battles are just so boring theyre elevated by williams score but still lack any sense of threat or drama
3012,starwars,
3013,starwars,thank you sir 👍👍
3014,starwars,you can tell you made it by hand from the fact that they all look like shit
3015,starwars,well ahsoka was trained in lightsaber forms and combat since she was like 3-5 whereas luke taught himself most of his lightsaber combat training he probably didn’t even know about the lightsaber forms until after episode 6love the real detail they put into the show
3016,starwars,trying to make good films sound silly in order to what justify bad films messing up the character nah no thanks
3017,starwars,its bad because so many parts make no sense serve no purpose and go against the logic of the star wars story thus far i dont care what structure they use to tell a story as long as its a good story tlj is the only star wars film i feel no urge whatsoever to watch back although solo is not miles ahead as a fan i am more than entitled to watch a film and form an opinion about it you calling anyone who disagrees with your view idiots says more about you than the millions you label
3018,starwars,this is the second time today and second time in my life seeing ep 1 vending machine
3019,starwars,i listened to an audio commentary for this movie and someone compared it to the scene in hamlet where he finds the skull of yorick
3020,starwars,yeah its not my best but its honest work
3021,starwars,i highly agree
3022,starwars,
3023,starwars,yeah a few people of said the same thought about it but couldn’t do it but have the start in with the temple march at least
3024,starwars,np
3025,starwars,lol it was on my tv i paused it and took this picture thats why it looks bad
3026,starwars,my baby shower was star wars themed so is my sons nursery i’m a huge fan &amp; this is the only place people don’t say “what if he doesn’t like star wars lol” --
3027,starwars,yeah the way i made it makes it look kinda dreamy line its a picture from a nightmare
3028,starwars,&gt; in tlj we learn that luke sensed the dark side in ben and acted on impulse trying to kill benhe didnt though
3029,starwars,the prophecy was supposed to bring balance to force to me this meant permanent balance
3030,starwars,i got one for christmas too  got another for my birthday and am hoping to get a third somewhat soon so i can do the ultimate one
3031,starwars,really ive never seen plagueis with a mask on
3032,starwars,oh now yall like her
3033,starwars,yesvery good point i guess i wanted to show the purge part first as anakin looks so menacing in that gear
3034,starwars,i am actually wondering how his armor got separated from him
3035,starwars,but what about anakin’s mitochondrial count
3036,starwars,this image looks like it has gone through a bunch of filters or something
3037,starwars,yes my husbands birthday is 10 days after my son so i was planning on surprising him with a helmet cake of his own plus a “dadalorian” shirt haha it’s all a work in progress i commissioned a shop on etsy to make a robe for our little one next project is to attempt making the blue macarons no way i’m paying $50 for 12 from william &amp; sonoma &amp; they don’t even look the part i’ve never planned a party before &amp; i am so excited clearly
3038,starwars,i bet the third to last ones feel nice 😩💦
3039,starwars,most of the are made from cardboard which i used plaster and bondo to make them smooth the other ones are made from foam with some bondo along the seams
3040,starwars,one of these things is not like the other
3041,starwars,&gt;make 2 separate universesyes yes yes yesreally they dont need to make anything the universes are there at least 3 of them the new owners of the ip just need to acknowledge that and authorize new stories
3042,starwars,may the force be with you because some of these books are really bad
3043,starwars,oooh man that is disturbing for some reason i mean good work but thats gonna keep me up tonight
3044,starwars,that’s the one and thanks for the kind comments 👍
3045,starwars,
3046,starwars,so what your saying is that wrinkley old fuck gets more than me
3047,starwars,every time i watch ep1 im always keeping an eye out for the crowd change its so funny and amazing they are just q-tips
3048,starwars,why do you say that
3049,starwars,order of release
3050,starwars,thanks
3051,starwars,yeah it looked so real to me for years but now they look like ps3 graphics/pre-rendered gaming scenes
3052,starwars,why do you hate fun
3053,starwars,*no no hes got a point*
3054,starwars,i don’t know why but this made me laugh hard its kinda like lidl version dooku and tarkin
3055,starwars,favreau has already said that the mandalorian will tie into the sequel trilogyno getting around it he filoni and the rest of the creative time simply dont share the negative opinion of the sequels
3056,starwars,you keep saying luke is “the most famous man in the galaxy” but is he genuinely asking i know we see that his name is broadcast to the galaxy when the second death star is blown up but no one in the room knows who he is when luke shows up except for gideon who would obviously know more about what happened to the empire than most normal people hell they’re all terrified to open the door when he shows up not exactly a beacon of hope
3057,starwars,im just a poor sith i need no ben kenobi
3058,starwars,kenooobi
3059,starwars,except he doesnt have legs
3060,starwars,i didn’t have any cash to try if it did :/ i highly doubt it though lol
3061,starwars,how do you make these
3062,starwars,im rewatching through the show now with my so and im amazed how good the show was from the very beginning they do a great job at establishing these characters quickly and making you care about them were mid seasn 3 atm and i really think theyve captured the spirit of the rebellion in the main 6 characters i love animated star wars
3063,starwars,book two of imperial commando was canceled after disney got the license
3064,starwars,what do you mean
3065,starwars,you’re just all over the mappoe spent the entire movie making dumb decisions that got people killedthe dreadnaught scene at least achieved something his stupidity the rest of the movie got people killed and in return they didn’t do anything to help the cause he’s a good leader in your eyes because you were predisposed to want to hate holdo and hated the film framed her as being correct
3066,starwars,mcu scarlet witch no unless the wandavision version powers up like in the comics because comics version alters reality on a huge scale and is far more powerful than the father
3067,starwars,the bad batch should’ve been delta squad
3068,starwars,yeah good idea to keep it out of the title is din going to be part of the celebration in any way
3069,starwars,it’s 2021 and people are still saying threepio
3070,starwars,impressivemost impressive
3071,starwars,what were the 4 better options they hadand yes poe doesn’t get to know the plan just because he wants to he ruined it because he was a petulant baby in that movie who couldn’t handle not being in charge and doing whatever he wanted
3072,starwars,i thought it was just as good
3073,starwars,its a fun concept of nothing else
3074,starwars,my thoughts exactly that’s no circle parry i will go as far as to say they there is no formal sword school that teaches you to whip your weapon behind your back  there are some wushu forms where you do that kind of stuff but that’s for show not fighting
3075,starwars,why not both it is a kids show but as with a lot of other great animated entertainment there is hidden depth there from the people who craft it
3076,starwars,vader lifting the walker dude was scary af
3077,starwars,we posted a primer to reading into the void at our good reads group heretl;dr version: - dawn of the jedi: force storm comprising issues 1-5 of the comic series- eruption short story- into the void chapters 1 and 2- the adventures of lanoree brock jedaii ranger journal entry from kindle daily post- into the void chapters 3 to the end- dawn of the jedi: the prisoner of bogan comprising issues 6-10 of the comic series- dawn of the jedi: force war comprising issues 11-15 of the comic series
3078,starwars,then again can´t we say same thing about ix
3079,starwars,still a work in progress we see
3080,starwars,you know very well that my point was that a leader sacrificing people’s lives is not a mark of bad leadership if they are accomplishing people worthwhile no one claims that all the rebel pilots who died fighting the first death star died due to bad leadership they only claim the ones who died in tlj died because of bad leadership because the movie decided to frame poe as the bad guy despite killing a similar threat with similar casualties no the dreadnaught couldn’t have destroyed a planet but it could have destroyed the fleet as it was evacuating
3081,starwars,makes sense
3082,starwars,can i come over and play legos some time
3083,starwars,like a 14 year old forced to get dressed up by his mom for a wedding
3084,starwars,thank you i said baby yoda because i wasn’t sure if that name is considered a season 2 spoiler or not
3085,starwars,it is curved  just like coumt dookus  christopher lee played saruman in lotr
3086,starwars,i just finished *princess of alderaan* she’s a secondary character in that book and she dyes it almost daily hahah
3087,starwars,keep in mind that at the time there werent many examples of big budget cgi so the things that seem obviously better without it werent so obvious back then cgi really was just the next thing to use as much as possible until we learned that it doesnt look good for everything
3088,starwars,kylo’s upsilon-class ship
3089,starwars,got any high res versions also please add a credit people will mercilessly steal this
3090,starwars,/r/ahsokatano
3091,starwars,really nice wallpaper
3092,starwars,that wasn’t the part i was referring to but we can talk about that poe did that because holdo flatly refused to tell him that they had a plan not that she refused to tell him what the plan *was* she didn’t tell him that there was any plan *at all* so he made his own plan which had a good chance of working if finn and rose hadn’t gotten a parking ticket something which directly caused the death of luke skywalker it is a mark of bad leadership when you are so uninspiring that your subordinates mutiny within hours of you taking command all she had to do was say “of course i have a plan but i’m not sharing it because you don’t need to know and i’m concerned about opsec” which would have satisfied poe at least for a while prevented the mutiny and his plan and in all likelihood kept luke skywalker from dying poe ruined a viable but still like the 5th best option they had plan because he had good reason to believe there was *no* plan which is why he took charge to try and save everyone
3093,starwars,his last post about darth maul is also stolen
3094,starwars,but when the same thing happened in esb it was fine
3095,starwars,👏👏👏👏 well done good sir a very well done
3096,starwars,thanks for tagging me
3097,starwars,they look great and i’m sure grogu would love eating them
3098,starwars,i would buy a droid off of him no haggle
3099,starwars,open your eyes to the dark side and seeeeeee
3100,starwars,we stayed at the coronado springs
3101,starwars,you see if i stay perfectly still no one will know i’m from fallout and not star wars
3102,starwars,
3103,starwars,
3104,starwars,good twice the software double the quality
3105,starwars,ok now i need this
3106,starwars,where younglings
3107,starwars,i wish i could see the masterpiece version
3108,starwars,these models always astound me
3109,starwars,with kevin klines score in the last two episodes of rebels season two you have just about the perfect star wars content its truly awesome every moment of those two episodes is visually breathtaking and the story telling is profound and oh so compelling one cannot tell another about these one must watch them this is the way
3110,starwars,maybe he’s had a bit too much cactus juiceit *is* after all the quenchiest
3111,starwars,“it rhymes”well it’s better than what we got and out of all the things you could do with the sequels it’s pretty interestingpersonally i would have preferred if they went more with gl’s original ideas and made it about the grandchildren
3112,starwars,lol are you “pro-bullying” lmfaodude your entire argument is “it’s bad because they killed off snoke” like this is lame 2017 arguing if you are mad about something like you fundamentally went into the movie expecting the exact same structure as the ot to occur in the st
3113,starwars,is there somewhere i can see the whole chronological order
3114,starwars,i think they could have satisfied the drama people wanted if they just had po join the first order and it would have fit the themes perfectly in episode 7 we see po in awe inside a star destroyer impressed with tie fighter capabilities and interrogated by kylo off screen he also loses his jacket and his droid gains a new affinity with rey and finn in episode 8 hes emotional and stages a coup doesnt like taking orders doesnt even meet rey until the last sceneepisode ix should have him be the first orders new toy so rey has someone to pilot fight and finn has a solid arc of destroying or saving finn
3115,starwars,im listening to audiobooks of legends novels i read as a kid definitely going to skip some duds but itll be a nice trip down memory lane just wish the whole republic commando series had audiobooks
3116,starwars,were the books series finished or was it abandoned after disney
3117,starwars,exceptional explanation lmao no its not what kind of circle parry goes behind your back what kind of person parries at thin air while watching the other person do the same what kind of fencer has the point of their blade sticking straight up or down and not right at their enemy and since when do two handed swords do circle parries youll twist your armnice attempt actually kind of a shit attempt but that is not a circle parry or even loosely based of one its just done that way because it looks fucking awesome
3118,starwars,i altering the pants
3119,starwars,like *most* of them the only ones we hear are luke obi-wan anakin yoda mace qui-gon kanan luminara adi and aayla there are hundreds of others not heard like ki-adi-mundi oppo rancisis stass allie depa billaba eeth koth kit fisto tiplar tiplee jocasta nu etc etc
3120,starwars,im not an mcu fan but now you got me interested lmao
3121,starwars,ive realised only after ive made this post
3122,starwars,*expensive* crappy fan fiction
3123,starwars,looks like we pissed off the disney fan boys
3124,starwars,this being a kid show is bad because its trying to be for old time fans and kids at the same time and fucks up miserablyalso most of this show is really boring and kanan and hera are one of the few people acting approtiately to the situation
3125,starwars,ok i disagree glad u like him the games were fun
3126,starwars,its over anakin  i have the high ground
3127,starwars,all hail lord revan
3128,starwars,wow i missed the part where they blew up the death star in tlj thanks to poe being a great leader my bad i’ll watch again
3129,starwars,you could say the light and dark were in balance which is why rey was able to defeat palps  remember luke didnt have a harness the force to save the day moment like rey did  he was helpless against the emperor
3130,starwars,seething with an unbridled rage is the termive done it quite a few times
3131,starwars,i couldnt remember the name
3132,starwars,and your online attitude shows you were definitely bullied in school
3133,starwars,anakin brings balance to the force by removing sidious from the living force as well as destroying the order of the sith lords30 years later as palpatine returns using the skywalker-palpatine dyad to create a wound in the cosmic force which allows him to take root in the living force again as  a sith entity who has absorbed all the souls of every sith lordanakin skywalker returns through the cosmic force with luke skywalker yoda obi-wan kenobi and every jedi to channel their power through rey to rid sidious and the sith from not just the living force but the cosmic force as well
3134,starwars,oh my goodness i can definitely see it lol my art style is influenced by atla a lot so it doesn’t surprise me
3135,starwars,yeah it was running away from the death star instead of fighting it in anh would have gotten less people killed than fighting it they did it because they couldn’t let the empire have that weapon people die in war a good leader makes their sacrifice worth it
3136,starwars,totally get why u like the last jedi more couldnt disagree more that it makes it better and if this is really the route disney is going i will greatly disappointed in favreau make 2 separate universes no need to retcon and theres more money for disney win win
3137,starwars,thats true i felt the same in some episodes in the clone wars rebels and even the mandalorian i guess pixar generally does a better job at that than star warsanyway if you havent finished rebels ill advise you to give it a second chance or at least search the important episodes and watch them there are some really good ones
3138,starwars,a couple of 13 year olds can film a better lightsaber battle than obi vs vader in new hope
3139,starwars,
3140,starwars,u/obi—wankenobi i made a wallpaper of this i’ll post to r/star wars and tag you
3141,starwars,i was going to be very disappointed if this wasn’t here
3142,starwars,fun time head over to a mcu sub and type in: ‘insert a non-mcu character here would destroy insert avenger in battle’ pop some popcorn crack a beer sit back and enjoy the show
3143,starwars,ty lee
3144,starwars,thanks for the response
3145,starwars,alas poor threepio i knew him well rrraarrwhhgwwr
3146,starwars,just because you haven’t seen them happen doesn’t mean they haven’t happened  introducing a narrative element like that isn’t a plot hole it’s there for dramatic effect assuming you’ve already engaged with the secondary belief of the story universe
3147,starwars,i wish you the best of luck - i went back to read some later legends titles i never got to before disney took over and its honestly been a slog  from corellia having some split with the new galactic alliance about keeping a standing army politics to jacen discovering so many different force powers its ridiculousnow in the old canon legends and the new canon disney *everything* was accounted for in the timeline live-action graphic novels even video games so you probably want to at least check out the graphic novels too  if you dont youll never read about the return of palpatine in the legends timeline
3148,starwars,what about it makes it chinese what does that even mean
3149,starwars,that’s the biggest straw man i’ve seen since 1939
3150,starwars,&gt;  galactic basics proto language galactic latingalactic basics proto-language was galactic common germanic galactic old basic adopted the word via galactic old french
3151,starwars,people can dislike whatever they want to but the arguments you’ve made show you probably are a moron
3152,starwars,they got their reputation for being awkwardly scripted terribly dialogued and stiffly acted films that barely resemble the trilogy theyre supposed to be prequels to sure theyve got fun moments but their reputation outside of this little sprout of actually they were good i dont think the complaints are undeserved
3153,starwars,character development was far greater in rebels than the st characters in this cartoon had more emotional send offs than luke han or leia
3154,starwars,i’ve always imagined that jj had this checklist while writing tfa and marked off “han” on it when he wrote the parts for poethen like a week before they’d start shooting kk called him and went: *“you remembered to make one of the characters black like we talked about right”*and jj just panicked because he forgot and made up some shit about an ex stormtrooper and quickly wrote that inwhen rian got handed tlj he went: *”wtf am i supposed to do with all these characters i know i’ll make some of them go on a fun sidequest”*and that’s how we got that “fun” canto bight plot
3155,starwars,it isn’t longer just go on wookieepedia the show starts five years before anh and ends in the same year as anh vader vs ahsoka was at the end of the second season
3156,starwars,is there any officially licensed full face motorcycle and bicycle helmets  disney is sitting on an untapped gold mine here
3157,starwars,dooku and palpatine fit in so well
3158,starwars,also i would mention his appearance in bad batch i believe is less likely than in the ahsoka series since she is more likely to seek him out
3159,starwars,i’m watching it now the first season was kind of campy and childish to me but i thought the same thing of clone wars i just finished season 3 and oh boy has it picked up considerably
3160,starwars,oh if were being literal how can you look at speech
3161,starwars,you arent capable of making fun of me you have nothing to say other than youre wrong you act as if you have the moral high ground without doing anything to earn it classic internet dweeb move you just dont like it cause youre dumb is the most pointless thing to say so its impossible for someone  to be a perfectly reasonable person who just didnt like the choices made by tlj filmmakers you either love tlj or youre a moron if your answer to that is yes youre hopeless if you answer no explain but you wont you cant
3162,starwars,
3163,starwars,like
3164,starwars,i mean it’s just super outlandish you suggested he could have ejected when we saw him in the cockpit as the explosion was happening i don’t see how the story would benefit from having plo koon survive
3165,starwars,i agree with the comment about maul and fett but there were books on palpatines return so i didnt mind that i think it would be easy so say plo survived considering we never saw his body and the movie director has gone on record saying we do not know he is dead
3166,starwars,yes youre right i couldnt catch that one noooooooooo
3167,starwars,it really looks amazing you managed to capture their darkness with excruciating detail well done
3168,starwars,a profhecy that misread could have been
3169,starwars,the third one seems to be when anakin gets his darth vader suit on
3170,starwars,sorry but i think it’s clear nothing about the sequels was planned in advance nothing
3171,starwars,rebels has higher highs imo but much lower lows and a real lack of consistency
3172,starwars,leia and holdo were both trashy leaders in #8first why was poe demoted literally why what was the plan he talks trash takes out some cannons and that alone is enough to give their evacuation time hell no the entire point of his attack was to soften a key target clearly their shit conceptualized bombers and fighters were prepped and on standby if the whole point was to wait for poe to pew pew a couple turrets and flee they would not have craft and crew ready to come on the wing commanders call that he was demoted shows how bipolar leia was and calls her competency into question second the attitude holdo showed was trash period you have all command staff gathered just to walk in and say youre in charge nothing to even address basic ideas not even going to say the situation is being assessed and to stand by for further orders thats just plain awful to be antagonistic toward poe shows how vapid she is and exposes johnsons own garbage attitude about leadership  i have no issue with any actresses or wardrobe my beef is the writing and directing that turned star wars into tokenized sjw fluff garbage mixed with a healthy dose of unbelievably bad military storytelling and design
3173,starwars,love it ❤
3174,starwars,yes because no one has ever survived a mere death experience in the star wars universe especially one involving fire in the same movie
3175,starwars,anakin struck balance to begin with; rey just helps restore it after a lullbut i wasnt a huge fan of the prophecy anyway so im fine with it being fulfilled in rotj and kinda done with from then on anakin fulfills it palpatine manages to cheat it briefly but is put down again with anakins help
3176,starwars,i just consider 7 8 and 9 crappy fan fiction so it all works
3177,starwars,yes because no one has ever survived a mere death experience in the star wars universe especially one involving fire in the same movie
3178,starwars,&gt;im gonna assume youre a casual fanwoo lets gatekeep fandom i guess if you dont consume every little piece of sw media like reading the novelisation of a film youre not a true fan huh
3179,starwars,they got their reputation from hissy fans that did not get what they wanted also their reputation is completely different nowadays so what is it worth really star wars fans are super inconsistent except that they hate star wars
3180,starwars,
3181,starwars,i always thought that obi-wan did all that except to teach anakin how to counter the attack he used as a master doesnt share all his secrets type deal but i guess that doesnt really seem like something obi-wan would do
3182,starwars,thanks
3183,starwars,more dramatic yes but it would be ridiculous for good hearted rey to suddenly be like “i need the powa of the daark syyide” then have to fight her former allies in a 2-3 hour span of the movie playing they would have had to make her a general or some ridiculous imperial rank even if she was “just” a padawan because of the imperial structure it would be weird
3184,starwars,
3185,starwars,
3186,starwars,please do a vader one
3187,starwars,yes anyone who criticizes a shitty movie are actually  hate driven fuming crazy people who dont think clearly
3188,starwars,these look amazing
3189,starwars,i disagree but i appreciate your well thought response compared to some of the others :
3190,starwars,caught in a sandstorm no escape from ol tatooine
3191,starwars,you should have started at dooku and turn it counter clockwise than its in chronological order :
3192,starwars,1 temple march with 501st legion2 dooku killing3  4 duel on mustafari cant identify the third blame on me or the viewing angle i though of vader and sidious planning lukes turn to the dark side in the throne room of ds-2 but i doubt its that one
3193,starwars,it’s outside the mt washington fire station
3194,starwars,
3195,starwars,season 1 and 2 except the final couple episodes of s2 are very bad i could never get into rebels or cw because of how childish both were but once you get into season 3 of either its greatngl i love both shows now but i wish they’d start focus on more mando-type content mando feels serious enough for adults but doesn’t have anything too bad in it to prevent kids from watching

3197,starwars,its totally that this move is bad but there are far worse things in the prequels than this
3198,starwars,lol so funny hahahaha and
3199,starwars,it’s a freeze frame lmao does your face hold the exact same expression for the entire duration of your experience of an emotion
3200,starwars,the thing that i had a hard time getting past watching the first episode of rebels was the dialogue it felt very explainey like they were concerned that their audience wouldnt be able to follow even a fairly simple storyline so they made sure that every other line is explaining whats happening thats pretty emblematic of childrens programming and its something i really just cant enjoythere is definitely a difference between childrens television programming and family feature programming like the pixar films you mentioned i think the latter goes to more lengths to keep adult viewers engaged because theyre a part of the expected audience too
3201,starwars,well they didnt get their reputation for nothing
3202,starwars,i was waiting for it 👍
3203,starwars,same explanation that jules and mia don’t know the title of the movie they’re in is pulp fiction if they called it ben would that intrigue you
3204,starwars,fear is the path to the dark side beer inhibits fear good beer is
3205,starwars,character is the story if the character is shit there is no story
3206,starwars,can i learn this power
3207,starwars,arrington hamill stick up for the fans is better than any half asses apology from hildago i’ll bet he looked like mof gideon at the end of the season when this tweet came out
3208,starwars,consistent within the trilogy yes and imo the stuff the prequels recontextualize is not as bad as the stuff the sequels do but the prequels still do it but yes the prequels and sequels have very different flaws
3209,starwars,creepio right before realizing in his altered state he built an evolution chamber
3210,starwars,they were in a desert i dont blame the guy
3211,starwars,genuine logic you mean from turning in the chancellor one minute and murdering children 5 minutes later
3212,starwars,imo rebels has the best iteration of vader in any show or movie dudes legitimately terrifying even more so than in rogue one and yet there are still those fantastic human moments like ahsokas vision and when she broke his mask that remind you that this is still anakin skywalkeranother thing i feel the series did great was connecting the pt and the ot when the two were so different in style that it was often hard to think of them as the same universe
3213,starwars,vader one is now my wallpaper
3214,starwars,loved this book  they just released the epic collection of tales of the jedi which is chronologically right after this story but the plots of either aren’t really connected specifically  i’ve done a legends deep dive into the content up until and including the bane trilogy novels and comics and it was fun as hell there’s only 11 novels from the before the republic and old republic time period and most of the lore-building is done through the comics  how you want to approach obtaining the comics is up to what you’re willing to spend i was able to put together a list of the various comics needed from wookiepedia then i’d track down which ones were in omnibus trade paper back tpb or epic collections on ebay  a lot are not collected and for those you’d have to track down individual issues most of the arcs are around 5 issues long so you can usually buy them together and if you are patient they aren’t too expensive be warned though a few story arcs or epic collection volumes do get pricey but if you are patient and are a completist it can be affordablei’m diving into the games kotor 1 and 2 and swtor  right now as they continue the lore around this period and are actually key to a lot of what happens in the comics/novelsthis period is 100% my favorite period in star wars 37000 bby - 1000 bby and while not canon most of this period doesn’t have major conflicts with the pt-ot-st saga for the legends stuff that occurs pt-era and onward there will be major conflicts starting post-rots  however the plagueis novel and all three pt movie book adaptations are great and you can brush off some of the canon/legend conflicts the marvel clone wars comic epic collections are worth reading but once again you’ll see some conflict with the cw canon series lastly shatterpoint is probably my favorite legend novel from this period but the use of one of the characters in rebels yanks this novel out of canon unfortunatelygood luck
3215,starwars,also didnt anakin battle a holoversion of maul during his early years training to be a jedi
3216,starwars,jon snow is that you
3217,starwars,real hamlet moment right there
3218,starwars,some people are just deranged it’s like elizabeth banks blaming before release the failure of charlie’s angels 2019 on men not going to see it because they can’t stand to see women in action movies despite their being plenty of successful ones before including other iterations of angels
3219,starwars,there is 0 reason for lightsaber to not have bellguards and it makes me upset people dont just slide their blades down to cut off their opponents fingers when they lock blades
3220,starwars,yeah man but even that’s not that great
3221,starwars,u/savevideo
3222,starwars,yeah screaming from my point of view the jedi are evil after a super long fight of giant flips and magic spins while surfing on lava doesnt have anywhere near the emotional weight of luke vs vader either time even though those are far more simplistic and contained to a few areas the rots one is just spectacle for spectacles sake with *horrible* lines thrown in
3223,starwars,thank you so many people fail to see this completely obvious point
3224,starwars,i know just thought it would be cool to have have two jedi friends then one turn like rots but finn vs kylo and rey
3225,starwars,
3226,starwars,
3227,starwars,its not one book like a bible its several different books that amount to the totality of the jedi knowledge you can see them all in the library scene yodas line is that library contained nothing that the girl rey does not already possess which is a cheeky double-meaning for luke it is intended to be taken that rey already has the courage conviction and ability to wield the force for good but truthfully she literally possesses the books in the library as is revealed later
3228,starwars,that would at least be interestingi just don’t like the finn as a jedi partyou don’t need to have every character use the force to be interesting
3229,starwars,id say the best movie is tfa
3230,starwars,&gt; youre speaking chineselooked like english to me
3231,starwars,yep i think it was the force awakens or last jedi cant remember which but the movie poster for the american release had finn on it right beside rey with the lightsaber like the scene towards the end where hes fighting kylo but the poster for the release in china he was 1/3 the size and in the background they really nerfed his character and made him not as great as he shouldve been
3232,starwars,no
3233,starwars,i feel like it was longer but then i remembered that kenobi has grey hair in rebels so
3234,starwars,amazing
3235,starwars,when all of your arguments are “this is bad” then yeah i will make fun of youall of the things you complain about aren’t bad at all you just don’t like them you wanted a big dumb movie that was just about lightsaber battles and nothing else your complaints suck and that’s why i don’t take people like you seriously at all
3236,starwars,thats one way to justify weird spinning and what is simply just unnatural wooden dialogue
3237,starwars,finn and that other character rebel pilot is useless bad written poor played sequels are bad as main characters bad mariesue plus 2 useless guys to fill space around her even if they all somehow was super jedi and super sith they still extremely pathetic
3238,starwars,i have less of an issue with story consistencies as i do with major physics consistencies; gravity wells hyperspace skipping hyperspace ramming etc create major plot holes that can’t really be retconned even with a low chance of success why not just hyperspace ram a million droid ships into a republic fleet it cheapens the other content
3239,starwars,using shit plot device to justify earlier shit plot device this is high level writing
3240,starwars,fuuuuuckthis is why i love star wars no matter how many times you watch any of the films theres always something new to be found in them
3241,starwars,anustart
3242,starwars,would be nice but this possibility was destroyed by introducing the inhibitor chip
3243,starwars,i know man sequels are shit
3244,starwars,oh dang my bad i actually never played the video game i only played the complete saga
3245,starwars,the bad patch is when an indie studio releases a hot fix that causes a crash at the loading screen
3246,starwars,this wouldve been better than the shit they produced
3247,starwars,not on the version i played
3248,starwars,since s3 will not be about grogu it will most likely be about din and bo trying to retake mandalore maybe din will be a connection between death watch and the rest of the mandalorian people and the armorer might even be a villain din has recognize the flaws of the creed and he might try to reunite the mandalorian people
3249,starwars,anyone looking for the original artist can find him here:  his name is danny haas and his work is incredible
3250,starwars,nihlus looks genuinely incredible
3251,starwars,this mans might just be arnold
3252,starwars,&gt;i dont whoever thinks that is an idiot  &gt;  &gt;although i would mind you dont speak for all star wars fans either did you read this fact of yours from georges mouth the creator of the whole fucking franchise that said he wanted to take the completely different path  &gt;  &gt;do you honestly feel if rey shows up on screens 40 years later people will cry outthe funny thing about tlj discourse is that a *lot* of really smart people love the last jedi like film crit hulk is not an idiot and to contrast longform well-written essays praising the last jedi to angry rants blasted across clickbaity youtube videos i have to wonder if in fact the opposite is true because for someone to walk away from the last jedi and compare it to say transformers films it really does seem that their understanding of the film is surface-level with no attempt to delve into its meaning or the creators intentions in good faith
3253,starwars,where did you stay
3254,starwars,uhh those are awesome nice work
3255,starwars,well we might as frickin well have a korey the kyber cartoon show then jfc
3256,starwars,parents who take their kids to see ted because hes an animated teddy bear
3257,starwars,i disagree about anakin i don’t think that’s explained at all “game mechanics” was one of the distinctions between levels of canon previously since they did away with that what’s leftthe contradictions from legends were fairly easily retconned once the prequels came out at least until the tcw series it’s not all that different from the current canon
3258,starwars,oh really lol
3259,starwars,that wouldve been epic but unfortunately disney really wanted the movie to do great in china and china isnt especially fond of black people
3260,starwars,i think star killer base should’ve killed everyone when it exploded
3261,starwars,its a seething rage
3262,starwars,this is just wrong a character should not be unlikable as some kind of writing device especially when they are supposed to be heroes not only did she not tell him even the most basic truth she actively mislead him and insulted him and basically pissed the crew off during an incredibly high stress situation where they are all about to diethe thing is having it be a reveal that oh she was right the whole time feels unearned because she has no redeemable qualities and the twist feels like all the characters had to act stupid to not communicate earlierits not well written its just a plot device just because it was intentional doesnt mean it was good
3263,starwars,i got the same book for christmas woth the same intentions next up is the lost tribe of the sith
3264,starwars,yeah the sequels are pretty trash would be cool to see rey and finn have a duel tho
3265,starwars,no foam and cardboard
3266,starwars,agreed people complain about some of the filler episodes in rebels but the clone wars had entire filler *arcs* then again most of your series is filler when it doesnt actually have a plotmeanwhile the rebels team almost always have a firm goal theyre trying to accomplish that the each season focuses on season 1 is ezra learning to be a jedi while fighting the empire on the side season 2 is them trying to find a new base season 3 is trying to uncover thrawns plans season 4 is the recapture of lothaladditionally the focus of rebels just makes for better stories its right in the names of the shows the clone wars is about the *wars* its the fighting the battles but rebels is about the *rebels* its about *characters* in tcw it often felt like the characters existed to setup the next action scene in rebels it feels like the action scenes exist to enhance and explore the characters
3267,starwars,i think they shouldve all stayed on starkiller base ngl
3268,starwars,thank you very much :d
3269,starwars,i love this it looks bad ass
3270,starwars,star wars episode 1 monopoly was the single greatest monopoly ever madethe board was 3d and beautiful and the “houses” were very star wars looking silver pieces that you would stack so the building got taller with each “house” and the “hotel” was a quite tall gold piece unfortunately every time i take it out to play it seems like one of the feet for the houses to lock in break off so i limit it to very special occasions now
3271,starwars,there is a huge gap between being just the good guys and literally attacking anyone who decides they want to leave the resistance without even letting them explain themselves nah terrible storytelling just like leia floating through space just like rey being no one just like snoke being pointless just like the entire casino plot just like the hacker just like luke trying to kill his sleeping nephew just like holdo not explaining her plan making everyone think they were doomed its just a crap film and an even worse star wars film you are free to disagree but the if you didnt like tlj then youre an idiot vibe people like you insist on is just the worst
3272,starwars,super sick
3273,starwars,the jump was just terrible writing it had nothing to do with actual strategy
3274,starwars,the only “bad” thing i like from this show is oded yoda
3275,starwars,another bit of advice:several buildings appear very nondescript with little or no signage outside some of the doors are not large doors easily noticed some could easily be walked past if youre not paying attention behind some of these doors are amazing little shops selling all kinds of sw things and some specialize in items exclusive to that shop theres probably a map i didnt use one -- i just wandered around in a happy daze -- but my advice is explore dont just go from one obvious site to the net obvious site -- look for the things in between too :  have fun its amazing
3276,starwars,he was misleading luke that entire time everything he said about himself should be taken with a grain of salt
3277,starwars,he was misleading luke that entire time everything he said about himself should be taken with a grain of salt
3278,starwars,i just realized i cant play that without completely uninstalling my game i have tale of two wastelands and i did it without the mod installing thing
3279,starwars,certainly two different ballparks for the shows i will admittedly say that rebels was tough to get all the way through but im glad i did the humour and gags were a lot at times which really threw off the tone but the great moments were truly worth it
3280,starwars,3d print
3281,starwars,was wondering what star wars character that was for a minute lol
3282,starwars,impressive
3283,starwars,where other than rebels have interdictors even been used  the ahsoka book is one of the few minor contradictions that exist that make any difference  the “mess” of anakin being the chosen one is fabricated he definitively brought balance to the force  and what do the mobile games have anything to do with canon  tokens and whatever are obviously just game mechanics
3284,starwars,gamers just look at the photo down on the left
3285,starwars,*imperial march intensifies*
3286,starwars,i like the grievous one
3287,starwars,ive never played kotor or anything but as i understand it in canon/eu stuff battle meditation is essentially just a massive moral booster for whichever army has the force user taking advantage of battle meditation  the forces get a second wind almost if it felt hopeless all of a sudden you and every single other person in your army feels like nothing can stop them and they continue fighting possibly with even more fervor than they had initially started with im not sure if it grants abilities to the effected targets with its aoe for lack of a better word - though i actually doubt this adding new abilities to your armed forces mid-battle actually seems much more detrimental than not
3288,starwars,those are the ones i have i looked quickly and there is another before that one as well
3289,starwars,literally he wanted nothing to do with it he was like yo bo-katan take this shit i yield no i don’t want to fight just take the damn saber no stop plz baby yoda help me
3290,starwars,i think bobas and maybe dins old one was made of durasteel
3291,starwars,i love this : 😍
3292,starwars,how embarassing
3293,starwars,the episode of rebels is three years before anh
3294,starwars,most star wars explained his wife really made the fans know what she thought of thosenwho did not
3295,starwars,i haven’t been since ge has been added but i’ve been to disney plenty i don’t know exactly which department you’d contact but i know there’s someone you can talk to specifically about trips involving people with special needs they can make a lot of accommodations that will go a long way in making your experience easier and more fun but you do have to tell them what’s up if they know ahead of time they can really go above and beyond customer service at wdw is over the top great and the more they know about your situation the more they can help
3296,starwars,we got lucky by just standing in a random line and the workers not kicking us out so i’m not sure how to actually do it properly especially with covid - but olgas cantina was a place that most felt like you were in the star wars universeit was pretty expensive so i’d say everyone order something different and share but again i went pre-covidit’s pretty hard to mess up galaxy’s edge the rides are fun and the decorations are unreal just let them go where they are interested in exploring and you’ll have fun
3297,starwars,thats cause a droid dont pull peoples arms out of their sockets when they lose
3298,starwars,i was really into his work but ngl him being on screen in the gaming chair just not a vibe a like same thing with star wars explained when they started to show their faces i just didnt like it i do like generation tech but they have shown their face since i was watching them
3299,starwars,dew it
3300,starwars,interdictor cruisers using gravity wells to prevent hyperspace in rebels but gravity wells not being an issue anywhere else the post-tcw ahsoka book contradicting s7 the whole mess with anakin as “the chosen one” the inclusion of mobile games that have stuff like “tokens” to collect it’s a lot of the same stuff from legends where there are multiple versions of the same events and they all supposedly happened at once
3301,starwars,who do you think originals and prequels were for let me give you a hint there’s a reason why sw toys are plastered all over children’s stores
3302,starwars,you dont know the power of the tighty whities
3303,starwars,dreadknotdoesnt change the fact that had he listened to leia they all would have died ¯\\\ツ\/¯
3304,starwars,plo koon is so dead lol we saw him die in an explosion despite you saying we only saw his ship
3305,starwars,deleted
3306,starwars,my biggest bit of advice that you may already know is at the beginning of your first day go to customer services and say you need a handicap pass that will give you access to the fastpass line they closed for covid we went at the beginning of december and i have a special needs cousin who got this pass and it helped her tremendously after that honestly just make sure to take time to explore batuu star wars land it’s not a very large area but it’s filled with so many cool things there’s also an app called disney play i believe and you can play games around batuu via your phone however i wasn’t able to get this to work if you’re able to get into the cantina do it it’s an amazing experienceif you have any more questions feel free to ask
3307,starwars,not only that but i think obi wan let anakin continue his secret relationship with padme because obi wan himself had experienced love satine yet was able to still remain true to the jedi ways i believe that both obi wan and yoda began to sense that anakin needed something more in his life after losing qui gon and then his mother yoda assigns anakin a padawan to train and care for obi wan let him continue his padme relationship and both of those relationship ultimately undermined anakins faith in the jedi way and directly led to his fall
3308,starwars,if their target audience was kids for the sequels then that would actually explain a lot
3309,starwars,the point is: dont take it so seriously enjoy how this ip can go everywherethere are a lot of cool details about marek; and just like sidious i believe anakin/vaders residues beyond his progeny could spawn a great show
3310,starwars,a good friend of mine who it took 3 years to convince to watch clone wars liked clone wars as a series better but thought rebels was more controlled in their storytelling
3311,starwars,is the disaster whatever happened to this screenshot
3312,starwars,i agree it’s all for kids but if adults enjoy it that’s not a problem at all but they shouldn’t expect to be the target age
3313,starwars,yolk is present in an egg even when it is fertilized
3314,starwars,its over anakin i have the high gas mileageyou underestimate my horsepower
3315,starwars,u/savevideo
3316,starwars,someone hasn’t played very much battlefront 2 lol
3317,starwars,in my opinion the darth vader episodes and obi wan episode are the only good episodes i have tried to get into this show multiple times but fail this show just doesn’t compare to clone wars
3318,starwars,they’re already paying him for the new thrawn books so maybe
3319,starwars,they meant chronologically
3320,starwars,everyones computers are easily hackable in mere seconds login / password protection / biometrics apparently doesnt existspend a fortune on training feeding and housing an army give the cheapest non-effective armor possible
3321,starwars,all too breezy
3322,starwars,the point they are making is break up the empire and the republic send all nations back to freedom no more imperialism
3323,starwars,i find your lack of pants disturbing
3324,starwars,vader is the best 👍👍
3325,starwars,her series was announced as a limited series so probably just the one season but it will conclude with a climactic crossover with mandalorian and rangers
3326,starwars,i want this on a t-shirt
3327,starwars,brings back so many memories
3328,starwars,id love to punch him in his receding hair line
3329,starwars,thanks - was too lazy to look this up myself  have a silver
3330,starwars,literally a gary stu*
3331,starwars,batch lol
3332,starwars,wow i never thought about it before but you’re right  no wonder obi-wan beat the newly christened darth vader
3333,starwars,you have brought peace justice and security to your new empire
3334,starwars,examples
3335,starwars,the best example i can think of is when kaan and hoth are on opposite sides of a space battle using battle meditation to combat the other both sides of the force using their influence on their pilots and soldiers to have a greater impact on the battle turning it effectively into a battle of will in the force
3336,starwars,the extent to which legends contradicted itself is greatly overstated and the extent to which the new canon does not is greatly understated
3337,starwars,
3338,starwars,ah i see you were mad they weren’t treated as “just the good guys”remember when the central plot of the entire prequel trilogy was that anakin couldn’t be in loveremember when the heroic moment of the original film was han deciding to come back and fight for the causethis is a very bizarre time to decide that this movie needed to have super bland “good guy” logic just because you don’t like itbut hey ignoring everything the other movies did and overanalyzing the realistic-ness of tlj is pretty much what this sub exists for so whatever
3339,starwars,i’d like to think of technology was better obi wan does his leap land and slice all at force super speed and maul can’t keep up but yes the way the scene is executed pun intended leaves a bit to be desired still a masterpiece for it’s time
3340,starwars,canon*anything before april 2014 is considered “legends” with the exception of the original six films and the clone wars film/show
3341,starwars,“you are a bold one”
3342,starwars,the entire reason ahsoka refused to train grogu was because she sensed his attachment to din ahsoka knew that it was anakins attachment to padme that led to his fall and she didnt want to risk grogu following down that path when grogu was first trained at the temple he didnt have that attachment to din yet
3343,starwars,&gt; lucas knew from the original trilogy experience thy every detail would be combed over for decadesthats a load of shit the man didnt even give enough of a shit to explain who sifo dyas was in the movie all about the clones you know why because sifo dyas was a typo it was supposed to be sido dyas you know sidious his fat fingers pressed f instead of d and he literally never bothered to change it backgeorge lucas never gave a fuck about the prequels as films they were vehicles to sell digital filmmaking
3344,starwars,well i am sure there are alternative explanations for the force in books and video games but thats a problem with mainstream star wars media as a whole not just sequels but your criticism is valid personally i like the idea of the force always having mystical and unknown parts and getting new abilities with once in a while but i understood why you dont like it
3345,starwars,you’ll have to explain that one for me what’s your point

3347,starwars,why is everyone getting downvoted anyway sick drawing man
3348,starwars,can you provide the raws i would love to have a tapestry made of some of these
3349,starwars,rebels &gt; clone wars
3350,starwars,foam for the front two on the right and cardboard for the rest
3351,starwars,looks at all the helmets ends with the ncr ranger helmet with the big iron on his hip
3352,starwars,i started dawn of the jedi at the weekend and i will be finishing tonightseen some reviews on amazon of people not liking it but i have really enjoyed it and have bought all the  dawn of the jedi comic series on comixology to continue its erahaving read and played everything of the old republic era comics books and games except tor game this was my first taste of even further backyoure braver than me in going through the entire legends in order i am doing it as a much smaller scale in doing the dawn of the jedi era book and comics then moving on do a reread of old republic era with tales of the jedi comics reread kotor comics play kotor 1 &amp; 2 and reread the old republic tie in booksi will probably then watch some youtube story playthrough videos of the old republic mmo as while i own it mmo games arent my thing enjoy your read through
3353,starwars,are you seriously trying to shame people from this fanbase after mando and the sequels 👀
3354,starwars,i really dont think the kid show designation should apply to things like avatar and rebels i would classify these as family shows being designed with cross-generational appeal contrast this with something like paw patrol or dora the explorer which are made entirely for children and make no attempt to entertain adult audiences
3355,starwars,if your dog goes missing in the near future you know who ate him
3356,starwars,i didnt say or even insinuate that only communist russia acted that way i merely used their treatment for traitors as an example the resistance/alliance is supposed to be the good guys no one was forced into joining or remaining with them it was just random terrible writing with no thought gone into it
3357,starwars,coins only
3358,starwars,too bad it looked ridiculous
3359,starwars,nooo hayden bad reeee
3360,starwars,i felt it was pretty clear just based on their interactions that they were longtime friends and i didn’t read bloodline until after seeing tlj; i think it just comes through in the acting
3361,starwars,these arent the cakes youre looking for
3362,starwars,jedi training is not character development all of the major character arc moments for both anakin amd luke are shown on screen besides ones that were added later in tcw but adding more with more screen time doesnt mean they didnt already have anakins major character arc spelled out in the movies because it was
3363,starwars,you have to realize as well that luke wouldve happily killed vader if he wasnt his father him being his father kinda fucked up how luke saw him
3364,starwars,damn mind blown i never made the connection
3365,starwars,his crown reminds me of thanos‘ infinity gauntlet
3366,starwars,those are pretty awesome what is the material
3367,starwars,i’ll do my jobi guarantee it - guy who has never fenced
3368,starwars,episodes i-vi the clone wars and blade squadron short story from star wars insider #149-150 are the only sw fiction that debuted before april 25 2014 that the lucasfilm story group still considered to be canon the rest of the sw fiction that debuted before that date was retconned and rebranded as legends
3369,starwars,this is a way
3370,starwars,this is what happens when you beat chewie at chess
3371,starwars,
3372,starwars,agreed but it wouldn’t have taken but a few simple lines of dialogue to establish that holdo and leia were life log friends i am only basing my comments on what so many other people have complained about with her character i had no issues with her and her attitudebut i think my perspective was a bit biased because i went into the movie already knowing who she was and what her motivations were
3373,starwars,cool thing about liking something divisive is that as much as there are people who despise it there’s as many who love it i liked tlj too so we just gotta take solace that we aren’t the only ones who do
3374,starwars,by those standards every character in the franchise falls under the same definition
3375,starwars,it reminds me of drugs and a healthy lifestyle maybe its time to start living like a normal human being or a jedi if you will :
3376,starwars,gotcha just wanted to make sure before you started up
3377,starwars,darth revan jealousy intensifies
3378,starwars,not a stupid question  canon is a designation for content that actually occurs in the star wars timeline  it replaces the various messy levels of canon that books/comics/games made up prior to 2014’s excellent novel a new dawn  for then on out stories and plots were monitored by the lucasfilm story group to make sure there’s consistency that legends content sorely lacked which has led to at worst minor contradictions rather than massive conflict between content
3379,starwars,*this is so wizard*
3380,starwars,i like the hello kitty one best
3381,starwars,the last jedi is my favorite star wars movie but im an idiot who lacks any sort of taste because of that
3382,starwars,make randall clark’s desert ranger armor from honest hearts
3383,starwars,oh my god finn got tasered and yes only communist russia punished deserters of war good history major we got here
3384,starwars,thanks
3385,starwars,thanks
3386,starwars,no my intentions are to read legends and canon
3387,starwars,stupid questionwhat exactly is the difference between cannon and noncannon
3388,starwars,thanks i will
3389,starwars,thanks
3390,starwars,holy shit it’s taken you six years to get that far yeah i was planning on reading the comics too are you playing the games too
3391,starwars,this might be the dumbest response i’ve ever read on here1 the didn’t ruin luke’s character and kylo killed millions of people guess luke was an idiot for seeing a mass slaughter in the future and getting scared before not doing anything and living the rest of his life in regret2 snoke wasn’t killed prematurely snoke sucked and was a weak palpatine rip off it was good to kill him off3 space combat it’s a fucking movie they didn’t fuck up anything 4 oh no not anti capitalism let me go cry about a movie saying something about capitalism being bad george would never put political themes in his movies5 oh no they misused characters based on what your guidance how were they misused do you know finn and poe personally6 oh yes all i do in my free time is watch youtube videos about total ownage why sjw tlj ruined my life her plan would have worked poe ruined it watch the movie again 7 huh8 um no they don’t but i’m sure you’re going to say because of the one call back where snoke is showing rey the fleet being destroyed that the entire movie is a copy9 kylo ren is the best part of the movie his character is perfect in this movie and the knights of ren are lame and didn’t need any further explanationyou’re the perfect example of someone who invested so much into the jj mystery box nonsense in tfa that the fact this movie wasn’t as cookie cutter as the previous one you’ve spent 3 years crying about it online
3392,starwars,and the thrawn trilogy goes without saying :p
3393,starwars,avatar is a kids show too no reason to hate on a show that has an intended audience
3394,starwars,the two on the back right and the kylo helmet were all made around the same time then the blue mando then the back left boba fett the the ncr ranger and clean boba fett were just made a few days ago
3395,starwars,episode 4  definitely - then 5 and 6 then back to 1 2 and 3
3396,starwars,i read that book twice and found it very enjoyablemy attempt to read legends chronological didnt get too far maybe 10 books i hope you succeed and enjoy legends is vast but very well curated and thats what made it so fun for me - the continuityi did read 120/133 regular novels and still going i will read and consume all of legends
3397,starwars,foam would be my favorite material for cosplays it being as light as it is
3398,starwars,i remember saving this when it was just 4 of them awesome work man
3399,starwars,plaster spackle and bondo
3400,starwars,from a game point of view he was fun he is pretty 1 dimensional though
3401,starwars,this is the recipe i used: it says to bake for 15-16 min i felt that was too long so i did 13 min
3402,starwars,i started in fall 2014 and am have just now made it past revenge of the sith im also supplimenting it with comics
3403,starwars,well the first thing was him being scared of not seeing his mother again
3404,starwars,yes and poe deliberately ruined a plan that would have saved most of the people on the ship to get them killed insteadi get all of you hate the movie but it’s as if none of you actually watched it
3405,starwars,it was a joke yeah
3406,starwars,these are all very impressive you should be proud
3407,starwars,because it was a fun video gamewith a neat concepta modifed version of starkiller would make a cool addition to canon
3408,starwars,yep i’m replaying kotor and this is exactly how bastilla’s battle meditation is described
3409,starwars,after reading bloodlines i’d love more young leia/holdo stuff political stories have rarely been made interesting in star wars but leia and her companions are good avenues fo explore telling some compelling political drama
3410,starwars,yes the part where he ruined a plan that would have got people not killed to get them killed instead was great leadership
3411,starwars,it’s like some of you didn’t watch itif finn and rose weren’t on snokes ship as apart of poe’s plan all of the ships abandoning the main ship would have done so undetected and none of them would have diepoe clearly ruined a viable plan and cost many lives just because this went over your head doesn’t mean the movie is bad
3412,starwars,yeah but the amount of calls for him to be canon is wild
3413,starwars,if you look closely you can see an at-at in the distance
3414,starwars,big iron on his hiiiip
3415,starwars,*cough*  next to darth bane ofc
3416,starwars,ncr ranger noice
3417,starwars,take your time and enjoy it theres no need to rush it in an attempt to catch up youre on your own journey and nobody elses some of the best moments in all of star wars are in rebels plus thrawn
3418,starwars,maybe down the road they’ll do more interview stuff
3419,starwars,luckily he taught his apprentice everything he knew
3420,starwars,who won the lottery i did
3421,starwars,just a quick pointer if your intentions are to read the star wars canon timeline of books then anything with that legends tag can be ignored
3422,starwars,nice ill deff do thatever since mando ended iv been trying to watch all the star wars lol
3423,starwars,*the ncr wont go quietly the empire can count on that*
3424,starwars,yes there’s a lot of irrational hate in this thread
3425,starwars,because he is a literally a video game charcter
3426,starwars,i did though season 3 altar of mortis was entertaining i am going to let them play some more do you have advice on cutting out a chunk of the episodes and only playing the absolute bare necessity for my husband not me
3427,starwars,
3428,starwars,that’s what i did skipped most of s1 and a little bit of 2
3429,starwars,apples to a car then
3430,starwars,bigger character pictures is what i was thinking too they’re way too small i’d probably triple them in size
3431,starwars,thanks
3432,starwars,i might look up a guide to see what episodes i can skip and head straight in to season 2
3433,starwars,surprisingly good i watched so many macaron videos i saw macarons in my dreams lol
3434,starwars,
3435,starwars,where at in pittsburgh
3436,starwars,i’d love to buy a print too when you start selling though the disney lawyers enter unless you’re actually have licensed ip
3437,starwars,physics have never been consistent in this work of soft fiction
3438,starwars,i like the blue mandolorian classic helm
3439,starwars,the kylo ren helmet is the only one that was paper mached the rest have a compilation of plaster spackle and bondo spotting putty
3440,starwars,the midichlorians are key far more important than the forcemissaa ja-ja binks
3441,starwars,ngl the first season is pretty bad it gets heaps during the s1 finale s2 onwards is almost as good as clone wars helps that vader maul ahsoka hondo and rex com back
3442,starwars,that’s what i used for the boba fett helmet in the back and the blue mando helmet it’s pretty handy stuff for smoothing down the domes
3443,starwars,agreed everyone says watch it it’s sooo good i just can’t get past the “kid” style art
3444,starwars,i tried watching it but it felt too much like a kids show
3445,starwars,i love all the content bridging the gap between the prequels and the ot it would certainly bum me out if we couldnt do that re: the mandalorian and the sequel trilogy  i know many people hate the sequels but even more people used to hate the prequels its fine no need to jump in on this multiverse trend because of it i wouldnt rule it out because it is indeed something all the cinematic universes suddenly want to do but i personally hate the idea for star wars i actually hate it for the mcu as well but whatever i dont care about marvel enough to be actually bothered by it emotional moments like character deaths lose all meaning if those same characters just pop up in the next timeline just look at doctor who at its worst was i supposed to care when rory died for the 84th time all stakes are gone when nothing is definite and nothing is ever final sorry for the partly off-topic rant lolas for this article they refer to reddit as source
3446,starwars,well perhaps the fact that this game aims to evolve the lego game format will be enough to persuade you  if not more game for me i suppose
3447,starwars,yeah macaroons are rough how did the texture turn out
3448,starwars,i wouldn’t mind if he didn’t get so much undeserved love and come to represent everything that star wars shouldn’t be
3449,starwars,oh i love voice acting in most games though seeing as the original two lego star wars were some of my favourite games as a kid the voice acting in the new games just really detracts from the whole experience for me makes the games feel too samey and similar to other games on the market with no interesting quirkshard to really explain it but im legitimately not at all a fan of the fact that they have voice acting now just cant enjoy the games nearly as much with it
3450,starwars,gotta love me some star souls
3451,starwars,would you ever consider making wallpapers i have a dual 4k setup and this would be amazing with the baddies on one monitor and the goodies on the other  its not a request though just a curious question - but all in all super well done
3452,starwars,woah thats  awesome i may have to take that route have to figure out how to use audible first lol i get random free credits all the time
3453,starwars,jedi academy wants to know your location
3454,starwars,hes terrible and literally a mary sue why does no one ever say this
3455,starwars,
3456,starwars,yummy they look
3457,starwars,starkiller is a stupid character there i said it
3458,starwars,voice acting ruining an entire game  seems kinda drastic dont you think
3459,starwars,&gt; i by no means meant to stir things upeh being honestyou kinda did tho didnt yah
3460,starwars,kyp durron force-canceling lizards vergere the yuuzhan vong the entirety of *children of the jedi * traviss’ highlander romance novel cliches disguised as mandalorians starkiller way op and ridiculous and joruus c’baoth with luuuuuuuuke the more u’s the more cloned
3461,starwars,
3462,starwars,link to original artist’s post on instagram
3463,starwars,poetrythat is a good trick
3464,starwars,what if after one murder the voice that distantly whispered murder more was now louder the dark side is corruptive using it makes you want to use it more
3465,starwars,i grabbed it on audible a couple months back because i found out it was read by ashley eckstein ahsoka voice actor was pretty decent not sure if i would read it but the audio book was enjoyable that said ive been really into the star wars audio books this past fall but the ahsoka one was the first i listened to and got me hooked
3466,starwars,and then flip it again when obi fights maul on tattooing  we see maul try to hit obi in the face like he did to qui gon  but obi aint having that shit
3467,starwars,that would be cool but it’s nihilus from kotor 2
3468,starwars,iirc xixor was referenced/seen in a hologram in *solo* he’s canon that does not mean any details about him from the game/books are canon it simply means he exists
3469,starwars,hmmm  it does  but that doesnt account for the chest piece which does have the heart of beskar so maybe some of the pieces are hand me downs  but they dont seem like beskar if his helmet can dent a wall but a space rhino can crush his old set maybe durasteel
3470,starwars,ha - eddie izzard is great
3471,starwars,chesko sebulba
3472,starwars,that was the thing that made her origin reveal in ix predictable in my mind  whether they had actually planned it or not they definitely teased it with her natural untrained fighting style  she repeatedly used the same jab-at-the-face move as palpy
3473,starwars,oh i thought this was still a hot topic it seems to be on youtube i by no means meant to stir things up
3474,starwars,the father is supposed to some kind of a godly being right so the father is stronger imo tho i admit my knowledge of marvel is very limitedhave you posted this in a marvel sub you might get different answers there
3475,starwars,i think by wrong youre asking why youre being down voted into oblivionits probably that the subject is just drama from a few days ago and most user/viewers of this sub are pastyou seem to be trying to keep some bullshit going frankly
3476,starwars,if im so wrong clearly there is a reason why can you tell me why im wrong
3477,starwars,now you need to animate it like this the best lego i have ever scene
3478,starwars,sure but youre not questioning the mindset of those who expressed interest youre question the rationale of fans who wish the character didnt exist the intrigue isnt there for them we have what we have in the character of holdo the rest is just a case of ifs and buts&gt;  ***i wish jar-jar never existed*** but am i going to beat that dead horse endlesslyand thats all the user above said on the matter but you insisted he elaborate
3479,starwars,seems more likely that you are tho as opposed to everyone elseright
3480,starwars,that’s the case in both the ot and pt  almost all of anakin’s training takes place between 1 and 2 the bulk of the cw takes place between 2 and 3 and there weren’t plans to show that until years later luke takes huge strides between 4 and 5 and 5 and 6 criticizing the sequels specifically because a side character was more fleshed out in side media is a bit disingenuous the franchise has always used other media to flesh out their characters and stories they do this because they usually leave a fair bit of space between each episode so the audience is always jumping back in at the middle of a conflict
3481,starwars,worthy
3482,starwars,alot of people can be wrong
3483,starwars,youre used to posting unpopular shitfair enough
3484,starwars,
3485,starwars,thanks 👍
3486,starwars,well i got the start in with the temple march tbh i couldn’t bring myself to build the younglings scene
3487,starwars,like i said im used to it
3488,starwars,i already a big picture of vader on my wall so i’m thinking maul for variety
3489,starwars,i have always been a little here and there on battle meditation the way it is depicted in kotors fleet battle makes it feel all very video gamey though i like your description that it purely keeps the jedis allied forces inspired though iirc the game kinda adds the feeling that it helps tactically organise everyone etc thats the bit i dont like
3490,starwars,where is jar jar
3491,starwars,your post is at 17% and dropping after about 10 minutesi guess you have it figured out and everyone else is wrong
3492,starwars,use to do this a lot in college made real looking helmets for fun if you want them to look smoother you can get lightweight spackling for drywall and sand them down you can get amazingly smooth curves if you want i can send some pics so you can see what i mean and if youre interested
3493,starwars,well somethings not right because now i cant see
3494,starwars,im used to my opinions being deemed wrong by biligerant people
3495,starwars,&gt; apples to orangesbut you can still compare them
3496,starwars,i know it’s a good show i just can’t get past the bad artstyle and the toothpick lightsabers same with clone wars
3497,starwars,apples to oranges but imo no
3498,starwars,is that what rage looks like huh must be rage in a galaxy far away or something maul looks bored but that might be the make up anakin i dont know contempt maybe for rage his face is way too closed its a if looks could kill face maybe but rage eh
3499,starwars,i had a hard time choosing between vader and maul it probably took me 5ish hours but that included letting my 5 year old help on some of the less intricate parts
3500,starwars,amazing 👍👍
3501,starwars,in regards to his old armour i believe it was made of scrap pieces of imperial armour his right shoulder looks alot like shore trooper armour
3502,starwars,it will be better much better they have yaddle
3503,starwars,that is really cool
3504,starwars,we already knew that story rebels and the ahsoka novel go into great detail about it still cool to actually see it tho this year
3505,starwars,so your intention with posting this video was to prove that he doesnt hate star warsand the title of the thread isi dont think this has the effect you are going for brotheri could be wrong
3506,starwars,jedi are weaklings compared to the ranger with the big iron on his hip
3507,starwars,what if delta squad are the antagonists
3508,starwars,clone wars season 7
3509,starwars,she was worried about the info getting out for good reason because when poe does learn of the plan he immediately tells finn and dj overhears dj then immediately gave that info to the first order when they got captured and the fo then began to pick them off she was not telling everyone the plan for that exact reason so she was pretty justified there
3510,starwars,no he tweeted his response this is an interview talking about his beginnings with star wars many are claiming he hates star wars this is the evidence disproving it
3511,starwars,love them i think they are a little too minimalist however i wonder if you could add a little something to make them a little more unique while also staying simple imo id make the icon of the character bigger and maybe add a picture - either a faded screenshot of a location important to the saber bottom half or some light sith / jedi markings as a background for the saber
3512,starwars,does this video address what happened
3513,starwars,on my case about the child support yaddle is
3514,starwars,
3515,starwars,*sees the new vegas one* *tunes into g-major* to the town of aro fryo rode a stranger one fine day
3516,starwars,i got one for christmas i think i’m going to work on it today i may do the maul one how long did it take you
3517,starwars,“darkest moment” it’s not the younglings slaughter scene you disappoint me op
3518,starwars,mainly just meaning the “holdo maneuver” was a clever idea
3519,starwars,i know
3520,starwars,you might want to elaborate on the “cool character” part
3521,starwars,i think so too
3522,starwars,21 year old pop machine
3523,starwars,oh now that’s some cool shit
3524,starwars,ima call the police bruh stop beheading bounty hunters
3525,starwars,obi wan and yoda wore the same clothes throughout hiding
3526,starwars,whenever a clickbaity title asks a question like this the answer is always no
3527,starwars,how would this connect from rise of skywalker i wouldnt mind a show about a canon starkiller call it something like rule of two
3528,starwars,oh  yes sorryit would have to be the part where you didnt say that  you *not saying that* confused me when you just now tried to claim that you said thatyoull have to forgive me i get easily confused like that
3529,starwars,how big is his robot peepee and did he get to choose
3530,starwars,because its the closest thing to justifying thier victim complex
3531,starwars,now this is real cola
3532,starwars,let’s talk about grogu’s blood  moff gideon states it was taken before grogu’s rescuecould this be used later say for making snoke powerful
3533,starwars,why are people still talking about this
3534,starwars,that’s starwars for you i guess 🤷‍♂️ how come quigon and obiwan managed to land on a complete backwater planet that just happens to be the home of the “chosen one”
3535,starwars,imagine the stench of the dress thoughunless she just has a huge wardrobe with 50 of the same dresses
3536,starwars,when he tried to match the mando with the green kid on his hiiiiiiiiip
3537,starwars,wait so she’s been wearing the same outfit and had the exact same haircut for decadeswhat a weirdo
3538,starwars,jedi can’t marry idiot
3539,starwars,did i miss something in the trilogy or did they really have palps jr the millennium falcon and the only map to luke skywalker all within a stones throw on jakku for no reason it was just a coincidence
3540,starwars,its a fairly common technique and from what i understand it always has been though i couldnt find any sources on that it can be used in lots of situations and makes you less predictable than if you only ever parry laterally one example i can think of is trying to parry your opponents feint and then circle-parrying when they try to disengage
3541,starwars,im kind of betting we will see more of him in rangers of the new republic
3542,starwars,i think battle meditation is another ability entirely its essentially a rallying ability that strengthens your allies and weakens your enemies from what i understood from the games and comics atleast in one tales of the jedi comics the abilitie straight up does the  fighting for you makes certain coincidences that favor you happen
3543,starwars,hi hduken thanks for contributing to /r/starwars sorry but we needed to remove your submission for the following reason -find another place to praise karate kid without insulting star wars to do itfeel free to message the mods regarding the removal of this submission by /u/hduken&amp;message=i have a question regarding the removal of this submission%28 with any questions
3544,starwars,would it blow your mind if i told you that he also inserted his dog into the movies not once but twicechewbacca and indiana jones
3545,starwars,if you every played for honor you know they were just feinting
3546,starwars,tfa is the only part of the sequel trilogy i actually like
3547,starwars,the sequels reminded me of the matrix trilogy first one was amazing then they didnt know what to do with the amazing story they created the complaints i see for the star wars sequels are very similar
3548,starwars,i enjoyed it the finn and poe getaway sequence was fantastic and i really was hoping the next film would show them having more adventures together but instead we got a mess that made both characters look like idiots
3549,starwars,“before the dark times”
3550,starwars,anakin is a good person stop taking movies too seriously
3551,starwars,one of theese things is not like the other 
3552,starwars,please i want to go back to 2014 every year since has just been getting worse and worse
3553,starwars,then your secret wife still dies of a broken heart  lose-lose
3554,starwars,the palpatine one got me like ‘imperium - fragrance for sith’
3555,starwars,real talk kyle rens cross guard lightsaber was one of the coolest things from the new trilogy
3556,starwars,hi avtarstateishydrated thanks for contributing to /r/starwars sorry but we needed to remove your submission for the following reason -**memes and macros**a meme is an image video piece of text etc that is copied often with slight variations and spread rapidly by internet users image macros are pictures superimposed with text for humorous effect mods have final say in this regard there are a few options for you to post memes and macros try /r/prequelmemes or /r/sequelmemesfeel free to message the mods regarding the removal of this submission by /u/avtarstateishydrated&amp;message=i have a question regarding the removal of this submission%28 with any questions
3557,starwars,and r/thesequels
3558,starwars,it’s a great movie the pacing is really well done the cinematography is excellent every frame could be a painting the nostalgia hits you right in the feels at least back then sure it was a movie “made by committee” but i don’t blame disney after their 4 billion investment it’s the only “sequel” movie that cracks my top 5
3559,starwars,because they’re poor movies that are occasionally rich in spectacle but poor on storybecause they break the established universeas to the examples of how they’re awful movies and break previous sw just look up any of the numerous youtube videos that have been done on the topic
3560,starwars,remember when they made suicide attacks out to be heroic and absolutely justified because the enemy must be destroyed
3561,starwars,since i scorn everything baby yoda this unseemly cartoon is right up my street :
3562,starwars,they’re irrelevant racists are gonna be racist 🤷‍♂️
3563,starwars,did you use papermache these look dope by the way i really enjoy the ncr ranger one and the clean boba fett
3564,starwars,neeja windu it looks this could go directly to canon i like it
3565,starwars,please make a tutorial this is fkng awesome
3566,starwars,that really drove home the incompetence of her character like they *told us* she was some hero but all were shown is a kamikaze attack a terrible message in and of itself after causing a mutiny with her sheer lack of leadership ability
3567,starwars,well it’s certainly a very handy and elegant explanation as to how the st is canon and at the same isntout in the real world outside the organa memorial psychiatric institution the galaxy continues on as it post rotj luke is rebuilding the order leia and han are raising their kidsblissfully unaware that an incurable schizophrenic for some reason have made them the center of her psychotic fantasies
3568,starwars,the inanimate stuff looks fine i would say but altogether to clean it is lacking imperfections to make the world feel real that paired with inconsistent light set ups at times does make it more noticeable but cg is bound to look dated over time as technology and techniques advance
3569,starwars,i really liked it toothen the last jedi was like hitting a slick patch of road and starting to lose controland finally the rise of skywalker was like trying to save the car from spinning out but over-correcting and crashing anyway
3570,starwars,thanks 👍
3571,starwars,jacen solo tried to use the dark side to do good got a little away from him but hey he achieved his goal in the endso it’s a win
3572,starwars,while i’m over here making kylo ren hold a baguette menecingly
3573,starwars,no there’s plenty r/starwarscantina is probably the best sub for that
3574,starwars,i mean sometimes you dont need things to be too new when they got on the falcon chills man
3575,starwars,force awakens was actually really good and jj abrams set up a lot of pretty interesting story lines sadly tlj completely butchered every single one and tros had to scramble to fix all of them just a mess all around
3576,starwars,i was also disappointed they likely couldn’t do the round table and more post production stuff due to covid even in a couple of the shots people were already wearing masks

3579,starwars,he didn’t jump for the high ground
3580,starwars,not really shit could have gone down really bad that pushed luke i mean we are seeing an imperial remnant that is competent and surviving pretty well in spite of the odds how they went from that to an first order with better technology but 3x the politicking infighting and backstabbing sounds like a major cockup too
3581,starwars,this is great and all but i feel like this has been covered so much already on this sub
3582,starwars,thats a problem all the sequels have; the characters get most of their development off screen
3583,starwars,theres a book dedicated to him hes the titular character good place to start
3584,starwars,haha right “intentional” it’s a trash movie that has trash characters trash characters
3585,starwars,am i seriously the only one who liked the force awakens
3586,starwars,thats so cool
3587,starwars,i think as fans people love to read into things if you watch the making of for phantom menace ewan did that before the take to get ready they liked it and left it in i think people give way more credit to things than needed now send me the downvotes
3588,starwars,i dont even think he read about them  he heard the phrase and thought thats what it wasi have no idea what a circle parry is but i *always* recognize someone full of shit on the internet
3589,starwars,if only trailers werent just condensed movies
3590,starwars,new vegas
3591,starwars,thanks
3592,starwars,thanks
3593,starwars,thanks
3594,starwars,why’s that i’ve been on a huge sw binge and just finished the novelisation of rots loved it
3595,starwars,thanks
3596,starwars,thanks
3597,starwars,i’m working on a full boba fett armor suit from the mandalorian
3598,starwars,that’s fair i didn’t get into the show until a couple years ago nostalgia always plays a big part in a lot of things one of the reasons i don’t hate episode 1 i remember the hype as a kid and it was so damn magical
3599,starwars,yes my character in the mmo star wars game i was chunky but i could wield a dual saber
3600,starwars,juggernaut trooper from the mandalorian just a repainted tank trooper helmet
3601,starwars,yes but i believe jar jar more than the rathtars i’m not saying the cgi is any better but it’s the people behind creating it that make you believe what your seeing i don’t really get that in the rathtar scene
3602,starwars,juggernaut trooper from the mandalorian just a repainted tank trooper helmet
3603,starwars,thanks
3604,starwars,yup it’s my library book bag
3605,starwars,cardboard for all but the clean boba fett and veteran ranger which are made from foam
3606,starwars,thanks
3607,starwars,thanks
3608,starwars,damn all the chips are on the table
3609,starwars,thanks don’t plan on stopping any time soon
3610,starwars,the dark side basically takes over your body as you succumb to hatred and fear theoretically you could control that or have someone else control it for you like a dr jekyll and mr hyde type situation with you hopping between the light and the darkalso what about dooku he was a very powerful dark side user and he almost never used the dark side for anything bad he was just a polite old man he didnt go around slaughtering people for looking at him funny he attended dinner parties and purchased tailored pajamas sure he used his charm for manipulating systems and royal families to join the separatists but i think we can all agree he wouldnt be much different if he wasnt doing it for those reasons
3611,starwars,thanks
3612,starwars,ugh **no more** alternate timeline shit
3613,starwars,thanks fetts is one of the most recent ones i’ve made
3614,starwars,the silver mando was my first then juggernaut trooper then blue mando then kylo ren’s both of fetts were made at the same time and then the veteran ranger helmet
3615,starwars,the dark side basically takes over your body as you succumb to hatred and fear theoretically you could control that or have someone else control it for you like a dr jekyll and mr hyde type situation with you hopping between the light and the darkalso what about dooku he was a very powerful dark side user and he almost never used the dark side for anything bad he was just a polite old man he didnt go around slaughtering people for looking at him funny he attended dinner parties and purchased tailored pajamas sure he used his charm for manipulating systems and royal families to join the separatists but i think we can all agree he wouldnt be much different if he wasnt doing it for those reasons
3616,starwars,the prequels definitely didnt go off the established eu the clone wars we got in the movie didnt feature the clones as the antagonists and we didnt see any cloned jedi or clones getting clone madness then theres obviously no order 66 and the jedi purge is portrayed as a much more drawn-out affair  they didnt stick to what they had at allyoure right that the story of 9 wasnt planned when making 7 and in hindsight that was a real mis-step 6 wasnt planned out when 5 was made either and the prequels were all written independently too with aotc being written in a mad rush because of how little things were planned out sometimes the approach works sometimes it doesnt &gt;it was so poorly written that they relied on graphics to blind people in to liking the movies it worked and people are stupid for letting it workdo you keep jumping between talking about the prequels and the sequels
3617,starwars,anakin knew obi-wan did the same move to maul thats how cocky and over confident he truly was
3618,starwars,so what disney has to walk on eggshells because of their business but its annoying to think that there are writers with great story ideas who are too scared to do something because someone might be offended
3619,starwars,thats awesome dude
3620,starwars,god after the appearance of the super battle droids in mando s1 i really want to see more modern live action cis stuff they just looked so goddamn good in modern tech
3621,starwars,thank you
3622,starwars,cardboard for every helmet but the rearmored bob fett and veteran ranger which are both made from foam
3623,starwars,damn this is too far grogu will be a padawan already
3624,starwars,nah it’s paper mache for kylo’s helmet and foam for the veteran ranger mask
3625,starwars,nerd lol jk these are amazing
3626,starwars,recasting will always look better and be less distracting the uncanny valley business needs to stop
3627,starwars,not disputing that ackbar has been a fan favorite for a long time but you know some people would have made that into a complaint
3628,starwars,lmfao facts watch us both be downvoted for saying something negative about the show i still like clone wars a tiny bit more tho it’s likely nostalgia as i grew up watching it every saturday
3629,starwars,thanks
3630,starwars,no
3631,starwars,haha love the ncr helmet
3632,starwars,i really like that plagieus is made in sw battlefront 2 such a good game wished it still got support
3633,starwars,thanks
3634,starwars,poetry etc
3635,starwars,a custom mando helmet was trying out a painting technique on it and liked how it turned out
3636,starwars,moral relativism is a flawed philosophical concept
3637,starwars,i don’t disagree but even i’m not dumb enough to say it on here lol it is a great show just waaaaaayyyy to much filler i think i might like rebels a bit more
3638,starwars,whhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
3639,starwars,thanks
3640,starwars,thanks
3641,starwars,mace windu had a son he has his purple sword
3642,starwars,i attempted one a while ago but it turned out very badit was before i started using plaster and bondo might try and make another own some time though
3643,starwars,yes the white trainers lets gooo
3644,starwars,the black one in the right corner disciples helmet from fo4
3645,starwars,yes both the x wing and the uwing were built by incom but it’s not a combination of an x wing and a y wing it was a part of the concept team when designing the ship for rogue one they took a lot of inspiration from the ships the rebellion used and that’s why it looks similar in universe i believe the u wing has the same engines in the the same configuration alongside the s foils on the wings since it makes sense to keep some commonality in your starship fleet: same spare parts and mechanical know how
3646,starwars,does it still work
3647,starwars,same could be said for clone wars imo there’s a lot of fluff and just plain bad story arks people seem to have a selective memory of it i sure did as i grew up watching it after a rewatch this year i’ve changed my opinion still a great show tho
3648,starwars,wow this is awesome
3649,starwars,thanks i am
3650,starwars,he was established long before more modern events i see your point but im frustrated that would even come up as an issue for an excellent plot idea
3651,starwars,this is the way
3652,starwars,i’ve got a youtube channel with a build video for most of those helmets 
3653,starwars,thanks
3654,starwars,vader looks like a character from the show dark
3655,starwars,plaster and bondo and a lot of sanding
3656,starwars,thanks i tried to make one out of cardboard a while back and wasn’t very pleased with the results
3657,starwars,i very strongly understand this he wants lego- i buy lego- i basically build the lego- he destroys the lego the jurassic world lego is basically just for the dinosaurs
3658,starwars,interesting theory which could allow for the sequels to remain as valid timeline for those who are big fans of them i’d be up for seeing how it works tho i’m still unsure of making time travelling a big part of star wars even tho i did enjoy how they incorporated it into rebels could work but the mandolorian is 25 years before the force awakens so there isn’t necessarily any conflict of timelines ahsoka could have died anytime up until and during the events of the sequel trilogy
3659,starwars,i think tandi is a sith
3660,starwars,rebels was also very overrated yes there were some “holy shit” moments the ashoka and i’m a huge ashoka hater moment where she says “i’m no jedi” was one of my favorite star wars moments but rebels is just so full of useless plot lines and filler it kills any momentum it would have 6/10
3661,starwars,you are pretty good
3662,starwars,amazing
3663,starwars,ikr ive seen people go out of their way trying to prove how star wars is not for kids but in reality it is always have been and always will be and theres absolutely nothing wrong or bad about that
3664,starwars,thanks
3665,starwars,that’s a good idea i’ll get making that
3666,starwars,
3667,starwars,&gt;universally hated &gt;everone thought finn time to step out of your bubble
3668,starwars,thanks
3669,starwars,even if it is its still a badass collection just because someone owns hello kitty stuff doesnt make them not cool thedooo for example plays a hello kitty guitar and shreds tf out of it
3670,starwars,i’ve got one just need to home it a bit more for larger prints
3671,starwars,no
3672,starwars,thanks
3673,starwars,2022
3674,starwars,pretty sure john boyega appearing in the trailer what is the most controversial thing since it started an entire boycott
3675,starwars,never saw it
3676,starwars,the second half of season 2 i thought had some pretty good episodes some reminded me a bit of rebels but yeah overall season 2 wasnt as good or consistent as season 1
3677,starwars,lmfao wait until they find out the entire saga is aimed towards kids
3678,starwars,that sounds terrible  how hard is it to believe she died before tfa  it’s 25 years  they can do several seasons of her series and give her an honorable retirement
3679,starwars,can you make more i love this
3680,starwars,nooo it’s impossible
3681,starwars,
3682,starwars,
3683,starwars,
3684,starwars,cant tell if sarcastic or not
3685,starwars,i dont understand why some consider being a kid show a bad thing use this term as a negative criticism and sometimes completely dismiss something just because its primarily aimed at kids being aimed at kids doesnt prevent something from having deep and meaningful stories i mean just look at pixar films for me star wars is like pixar its aimed at kids and still have deep and meaningful stories that everyone can relate to learn from and most importantly enjoy
3686,starwars,well it will go down if i dont stop after one murderand what if i have to kill someone to save 20 other people
3687,starwars,
3688,starwars,be civil
3689,starwars,this guy is right battle meditation is what bastilla uses it can influence the morale of an entire battle simultaneously inspiring allies and demoralising enemies she was particularly adept at it hence her importance within the jedi order
3690,starwars,head to big
3691,starwars,yeah i knew the movie was going to suck when they made the “can you hear me” type joke in the opening scene
3692,starwars,
3693,starwars,
3694,starwars,this lol
3695,starwars,it’s true haha
3696,starwars,i think its legit just a wholesome story i didnt expect to see
3697,starwars,thats not what a circle parry looks like at all bro
3698,starwars,
3699,starwars,rebels is a great show but it does not start this way i stopped watching after season 1 because i was tired of people fighting for the top bunked and getting fruits at the market i’m glad i came back and watched the rest of the show because of there were amazing episodes
3700,starwars,circle parrying is what vader did to luke right before slicing his hand off
3701,starwars,yeah but if you look up a circle parry it doesnt back what the video discusses
3702,starwars,lol touché
3703,starwars,/r/fencing
3704,starwars,
3705,starwars,i laughed
3706,starwars,me neither i’ve accepted its not for me and moved on i do see the younger generation enjoying it tho

3716,starwars,i accidentaly thought this was an r/moviescirclejerk post
3717,starwars,its important to note that the dark side is corruptingand makes it easier to go to further extremes
3718,starwars,malak looks straight out of 40k
3719,starwars,indeed theyre just bad movies and a huge wasted opportunity people who grew up with them love them tho
3720,starwars,space covid hit tatooine a few years before a new hope and that felt like 20 years before it was resolved so obi wan feels like he hasnt gone by obi wan for 30 years which would be since before luke was alive even though in reality its only been like 10 years since he stopped using the name

3723,starwars,ive been meaning to give them space
3724,starwars,jon’s just nuts in this
3725,starwars,the outcome of the fight is important the 20 minutes of lightsaber twirling backflips and over-choreographed dueling where neither obi wan or anakin look threatened is not important the fight should have been the most intensely personal and emotional duel of the saga with obi wan showing regret and reluctance and anakin pure hate but instead they dont even look like theyre trying to damage each other for most of it
3726,starwars,yarael poof was still alive during the high republic
3727,starwars,what is scratch and how do you turn it into helmets
3728,starwars,is this just fantasie
3729,starwars,did anakin post this
3730,starwars,nihilus looks great
3731,starwars,bad is only a perspective cannibalistic tribes see eating humans as good we see it as bad but we can’t tell them what’s good an what’s bad because they think another way there is no real good or bad even if you fuck up the planet to make humanity go extinct if you believe that is good then it is good you see where i’m going here
3732,starwars,nope luke was not saying killing is wrong killing was not against jedi rules it was the emotion behind it they cared about luke was only refusing to strike down his enemy in anger as that is what leads to the dark side the blowing up of the death star was to save lives of other planets not an attack from anger additionally we dont know lukes plan after refusing he was caught off guard by the force lightening he may have killed for justified reason he may have said its better they answer to crimes we simply dont know
3733,starwars,lol conflating gameplay mechanics with lore is pretty silly
3734,starwars,i dont think she does shes far too busy almost dying to kylo to do much more than swing and run
3735,starwars,it’s not comparable to real-life kamikaze pilots once you weaponize hyperspace it becomes pretty much the most powerful weapon in star wars now all you have to do it build a bunch of craft specifically designed for hyperspace ramming that are controlled by droids why wasn’t this done ever before
3736,starwars,
3737,starwars,good to know
3738,starwars,im placing bets that the sequels will not happen or rather theyll be made non existent there is no conceivable way where this luke we saw in the mandalorian will end up raising a light saber to kill a confused boy i refuse to believe that and nothing will change that
3739,starwars,luke was trying to convince his dad to not be a baddiehe didnt not attack the emperor because it was wrong but because it predictably ends up with luke having to fight his dad which is what palpy wanted and luke knew that
3740,starwars,now i just have to read it asap hahaha
3741,starwars,when you finally see what a pt fan looks like
3742,starwars,uh huh i too watched the movie
3743,starwars,they said nothing about the music and thats what i was hoping for
3744,starwars,thanks
3745,starwars,cheered me up love this
3746,starwars,what is parallel to oedipus both tricked by destiny they didnt want fatum to come true so much they made it truth yourself
3747,starwars,well he had a choice to kill or spare vader but none against the death star if he wanted his friends to survive
3748,starwars,amazing work man
3749,starwars,youre someone on the road to hell thats how it startsyou do good things you save people bring peace catch the bad guysthen you get scared what if someone worse comes along and fills the void you made what if another war breaks out and ruins the peace you createdyou find yourself having to push more impose yourself more for the good of everyonethen one day you look round and youre a tyrant
3750,starwars,if i had a costume that good i wouldnt need my clothes i would wear this every day
3751,starwars,
3752,starwars,youre so fucking stupid there was no case i just didnt shut you down as rudely as i felt because youd go report me to the forum moderatorsyou have no real idea about what the term sentience means and you dont seem to grasp the difference between an animal that only eats shits drinks and sleeps and a sentient and sapient being that has emotions and feelingsplease dont act like your stupidity makes any since
3753,starwars,check out the critical drinker on youtube he did a video called fixing and another called fixing luke and they were both great he improved the stories of rey and luke and the other characters 1000% without making any drastic changes to the films
3754,starwars,anakin and vader make up for one person they might be different sides of him anakin that is but they are not completely different entitiesi am your father is more effective than your father inhabited this body before i took overlucifer/anakin was the arch angel/the jedi before becoming corrupt and turning into satan/vader
3755,starwars,hello everyone this is my most recent project and i wanted to share it with you all for the past two months squadrons has been my go-to game and i suppose its rubbing off a littlehope you enjoy
3756,starwars,empire strikes back variant cover by chris sprouse karl story and neeraj menon
3757,starwars,but thats a green saber
3758,starwars,i didnt shit on anybody i shited on resistance
3759,starwars,never understood this criticism we are in poe’s pov he doesn’t know the plan considering he was just demoted she owes him no explanation  a general doesn’t have to disclose every detail of their plan clearly the crew that needs to know knows as they are on course and have planned this out
3760,starwars,thats true thats not the best example my bad
3761,starwars,we wont go quietly empire can count on that
3762,starwars,&gt; as for nihilus ive always been terrified of his designsame here i always feel something unsettling about the angular-shaped hood the mask that comes along with it and the shadow of a face beneath it
3763,starwars,obi-wan let himself die to save luke im not saying vader wouldnt have won eventually but that fight doesnt really indicate whether theres a power difference between them
3764,starwars,didnt realize that scene was mocked i just thought it was awesome and now had a explaintion to it thanks op
3765,starwars,no mans sky but with lightsabers
3766,starwars,each to own but doesnt mean you have to also shit on someone for adding something
3767,starwars,you can still do bad while thinking you’re doing good that would inherently make you the bad side
3768,starwars,see how a hypothetical situation triggered ur ass while u had no problem in seeing something like this happen with another being  point proven if just the thought of this situation makes u jump through all the hoops i placed for u  then imagine how it must have been for that mudhorn ps: since it is a hypothetical situation mando will kick ur ass try using mma jungle tricks against a fucking rifle thanx for proving my point though its funny how u find the same scenario insignificant with someone elses life while u cried ur pants out when it came to ur own case closed 
3769,starwars,if you murder a murderer the number os murderers in the world doesn’t changedoing a bad thing for good reasons doesn’t change the thing you didthe dark side isn’t force lightning or force choke the dark side is getting power from hatred and fear
3770,starwars,nice
3771,starwars,great for you im like 14 and hated it&gt;youre going to use kid show there are plenty of examples of shows being marketed for kids but liked or beloved by adultsfam i know i used clone wars as an example im just saying that resistance was more like dora the explorer where clone wars were like avatar for me
3772,starwars,deleted
3773,starwars,if he got to a point where he could use force lightning or something then he wouldve probably won the duel he was already more powerful in the force but his overconfidence as a result is what caused him to fail
3774,starwars,and so the courier who had cheated death in the cemetery outside goodsprings cheated death once again and the mojave wasteland was forever changed
3775,starwars,well i didnt want the post to be salty its just my opinion thats what reddit is here for isnt it
3776,starwars,im 25 years old i enjoyed resistance i know episode 7 is on the list i was using it as a reference point for where resistance would lay and if youre going to use kid show there are plenty of examples of shows being marketed for kids but liked or beloved by adults and clone wars is one of those marketed towards kids but beloved by both i would say even episodes 1-3 probably 4-6 too even outside star wars you got plenty more
3777,starwars,while jar jar was certainly an achievement for the time he doesnt even come close to the visuals of tfa as divisive as the sequels are its hard to say that they dont look amazing
3778,starwars,yeah it’s stupid i am honestly very concerned about the kenobi show it’s gonna be stupid when rewatching ep 4 that everyone called him obi wan and that he was going on planet hopping adventures instead of just watching luke on tattoine it’s also gonna be awkward rewatching their ep 4 fight if they fight beforehand during the show lines like “when i left you i was but the learner now i am the master” and “the circle is now complete” are gonna be stupid if they have already fought again between ep 3 and ep 4 it’s also gonna be groan inducing when we eventually hear “hello there” and “high ground” references thrown into the kenobi show to appease the members sigh i hope i’m wrong but i have a very bad feeling about this show
3779,starwars,yeah well these are my opinions and my guess what happensim not saying people wont love the new triology years later they will its just that the standards have droppedand its more then obvious prequels are at a weird place even i dont think they are good movies but the problems are at the surface rather then in the cannon the new star wars changes cannon without explaining anythingand this is the problem right here we dont know what force is why 1 line from yoda explains their whole story key if everything in star wars is so relient on use of the force why isnt it completely explained yet
3780,starwars,i am the loop
3781,starwars,- episode 7 is on the list-resistance is a kid show that can only be enjoyed by a younger audienceits not like clone wars since that can be enjoyed by kids and adults-ig you could
3782,starwars,funny cause dooku does one against obi wan in episode 2
3783,starwars,it was definitely unfertilised when the jawas ate it because it was just full of yolk so it wasnt a living child yet
3784,starwars,he was saying this to luke “from a certain point of view”  again
3785,starwars,hey hold upepisode 7resistancei know people knock sw resistance but its still star wars between episode 2 and 3 you could also add in the 2002 clone wars
3786,starwars,that’s life in the galaxy
3787,starwars,probably this
3788,starwars,yes definitely thats a good metric to judge a films quality unless its clear youre really stretching to make those adjectives work on obscure ways not with rots though no no no
3789,starwars,b-wing
3790,starwars,can you read englishwhat about i dont like this in those movies does not make sense to you
3791,starwars,
3792,starwars,mayfeld helped assist in operation: cinder an event so haunting and horrific to him that another officer mentioning it caused him to snap and shoot him in the face that added in with his nihilistic view of the galaxy paints the picture of a man who is deeply traumatized and disgusted at his own involvement in it i agree ptsd gets thrown around a lot but the shoe fits here
3793,starwars,man i cannot remember what it looked like pics
3794,starwars,some of it is good  when the vfx start going on heavy it starts looking unnecessaryeverything is good except:1:  obi force pushing vador  cape freezes and he slide like a video game2  exploding barrels and flaming vader  cool idea but flames looked fake3  force push obi and sliding lightsaber  again very video game lookingbesides that the music choreograph the tone were excellent
3795,starwars,i dont whoever thinks that is an idiotalthough i would mind you dont speak for all star wars fans either did you read this fact of yours from georges mouth the creator of the whole fucking franchise that said he wanted to take the completely different pathdo you honestly feel if rey shows up on screens 40 years later people will cry out
3796,starwars,this cover was not made 100% by me i just wanted to see if my printer was able to print covers so this was really just a test but i am planning to make some covers myself in the future
3797,starwars,patrolling the mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
3798,starwars,literally asajj ventresss backstoryi think her consclusion was that the dark side just eventually consumed you
3799,starwars,this is so sick
3800,starwars,any chance you’d upload the hi res individuals if love to use the revan as a wallpaper
3801,starwars,damn these other pics are disturb 9000
3802,starwars,i got this for christmas it’s a unique twist on monopoly but once one player has control there is no way to win so it’s eh
3803,starwars,black series
3804,starwars,mace windu
3805,starwars,luke wouldnt hold a grudge period the luke i personally want to see is the luke from the eu and that luke doesnt hold a grudge because that would push him to the dark side and invalidate everything established in the trilogyalso it doesnt make sense for luke to hold a grudge
3806,starwars,who is the one on the lower left
3807,starwars,it had to be dramatic and dangerous
3808,starwars,
3809,starwars,well if you think your opponent is about to force jump behind you would that not be a valid preparation
3810,starwars,that is talent  my only suggestion is the north face emblem  i know youre being true to the outfit but the logo keeps catching my eye
3811,starwars,unless he won the lottery
3812,starwars,there are several questions in my post which one of them did you reply no with   careful if you meant that as a blanket statement its a no-brainer that its obviously going to lead to more questions particularly on the logical basis of how you arrived at a no
3813,starwars,makes sense
3814,starwars,
3815,starwars,this is true in my head canon
3816,starwars,wheres the girl
3817,starwars,don’t short jonor make him too short
3818,starwars,i wish they had shown it
3819,starwars,no no thats a completely valid point that movie is way better than it has any right to be
3820,starwars,the star wars universe movies/series needs a live-action female sith and not one that will go away at the end of only one movie
3821,starwars,i love the bottom right one
3822,starwars,thats how anakin started down the path to the dark side he just wanted to save the people he loved from dying and wound up causing the death of his wife i guess grey jedi use dark-ish force powers for good but the craving for power is the differentiator in that situation also selfish acts vs selfless acts but then i suppose it wouldnt be dark sided if your motivation was coming from a selfless place if anakin had stuck around with the jedi he may have learned force healing and been able to keep padme from dying during childbirth or at least not force choked her which led to her death during childbirth if i understand things correctly
3823,starwars,no he didnt player 1 is always blue and player 2 is always green
3824,starwars,who is the one on the bottom left
3825,starwars,
3826,starwars,damn ripping off maul *again* with the robot legs
3827,starwars,a person who just uses the dark side like i’ve always been interested in seeing a force user channel their anger and hatred for righteous causes like this village took them in and they really like it there but this pirate gang keeps harassing them so they force choke this pirate leader to death it’s inward and selfish and can channel their anger and hate but from certain perspectives it can look like a good thing to do remember jedi and sith are religions that have their own principles and philosophies that have nothing to do with the force itself like the sith were all about bending the force to their will and amassing more and more power while the knights of ren believed in just existing and living their lives the way they wanted seemingly without the need to control the galaxy both use the dark side of the force but in completely different styles
3828,starwars,thanks mate
3829,starwars,yes
3830,starwars,no
3831,starwars,&gt; the lambdas/sentinels having doors also on the rear so they can dock without needing to actually land same way the twilight does in tcthere is a hatch on the rear of both ships the slave 1s has a clamp that allows it to board smaller shuttles
3832,starwars,&gt; the lambdas/sentinels having doors also on the rear so they can dock without needing to actually land same way the twilight does in tcthere is a hatch on the rear of both ships the slave 1s has a clamp that allows it to board smaller shuttles
3833,starwars,a bad guy once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your lifeyou can’t use the dark side and stay good
3834,starwars,you’re right i forgot ep 9-10 is right before rots sense there going to save palps but 11-12 is during order 66 and the battle on mandalore and if you’re doing a full in order watch you need to watch s7 split up for a more enjoyable and accurate event
3835,starwars,
3836,starwars,
3837,starwars,i was sitting here for a few minutes thinking that the dooku piece looks really like dracula then remembered that the guy who plays dooku also played dracula
3838,starwars,i want this in my house 😂
3839,starwars,allowed to screenshot and use as wallpaper
3840,starwars,&gt; try spinning thats a good trick
3841,starwars,but where would slave 1 attach to lambda
3842,starwars,how long did you have to knead the dough to make that boba fett helmet
3843,starwars,“sith lords are our specialty”
3844,starwars,“patrolling the mojave makes you wish there was a nuclear winter”
3845,starwars,u/reprops you should do sabines helmet next
3846,starwars,the new episode went through all season 2 episodes so i assume that was it i imagine they’re just gonna do a single episode now for each season
3847,starwars,sorry reminds me of pirates of the caribbean our destinies have been entwined elizabeth but never joined
3848,starwars,beat me to it
3849,starwars,best scene ever
3850,starwars,&gt;and this is what clickbaiters do to gaslight and manipulate people on the internet they will do and write anything to get the click ad revenue for money even if its fake made up or speculationthey might be but with what proof do you have that the specific intention of this person would be the same as opposed to a different intention altogether is this not merely a projection or better a claim on mind-reading itself&gt;secondly he doesnt even source where he got the information he doesnt credit his sources on that seven samurai/zack snyder thing so he doesnt even give proper credit to the people who previously reported that informationbut isnt that what the colloquial meaning for the word theory meant to serve this would include speculation with other supposedly relevant information and the fact that it remained as an opinion piece or a hypothesis showed that it wasnt meant to be taken as the truthsurely we have the meta-cognitive abilities to discern this regardless of whether or not it resembles a clickbait of which you instantly assumed to be lie if the admission of fact was even conceived in the first place
3851,starwars,i just 100% the game before christmas so much fun to go back to this game
3852,starwars,this was a joke right
3853,starwars,no they couldnt be from both if you know the games well enough you know that the graphics of the games/image are diffrent aswell as the facial expressions in this image these icons have less reflection and have the older facial expressions of the icon as someone who has played these games alot and in recent yeara modded it i can say with 100% certainty that this lego star wars the videogame and not the complete saga
3854,starwars,new vegas helmet got you looking like a rich man
3855,starwars,its pretty telling youve written a garbage character when the best thing they can do is literally break the in universe physics to kill themselves
3856,starwars,woah there’s a fallout miami and eyyy sorta same here though i never expected it’d actually come out lol
3857,starwars,jar jar binks was good
3858,starwars,how could i forget the mask
3859,starwars,ncr ranger helmet looks sick
3860,starwars,nah the last 4 are the revenge of the with since the attack on corosaunt starts as ahsoka gets her group of clones to attack bangalorethe rest is happening before thatand i would also like to argue that you cant just watch the last season cause unlike the mandalorian youll need to know quite a bit
3861,starwars,boba fett looking realistic
3862,starwars,no this image could be from either - they both start the same way
3863,starwars,&gt;to the point where his script went against everything george lucas assertedwhich means the movie would be very well received by the fandom
3864,starwars,that doesnt make it any less misleading and this is what clickbaiters do to gaslight and manipulate people on the internet they will do and write anything to get the click ad revenue for money even if its fake made up or speculation
3865,starwars,my main takeaway from this entire comment thread is the st blows massive ass and tlj is the worst movie in the worst trilogy ill expect to get downvoted all to hell and have some dumbass respond to me with about 3 paragraphs explaining how im wrong in about an hour
3866,starwars,
3867,starwars,&gt;miniaturized death star tech itll crack that door open like an egg - finn also calls it a battering ram cannon which implies its purpose is to bust open the doorhuh cant remember that at all must have spaced out oh well fair still feels dumb to me to state that its death star tech when it really doesnt do anything all that impressive certainly my expectations as soon as they stated it was death star tech was that it was a doomsday weapons since thats what the death star is rather than like a half-decent bunker buster&gt; the themes are in fact entirely consistent well we disagree :
3868,starwars,&gt;most reviews at the time always had to say after the horrible prequels star wars is backto be perfectly honest as someone who grew up with both and was 13 when tfa released thats exactly what it felt like at the time for not just me but all the sw fans i know irli only know one person who actually likes the pt irl and even he agreed they werent that good most of my sw fan peers gave him no shit for it some were arseholes about it idk in my experience if you were born before 2004 you just didnt like the pt not that it wasnt acceptable to or anything just most of us didnt enjoy themtlj soured many of their opinions of the st its my favourite film of the 9 but tfa had many of them excited and were happy to get away from the pt
3869,starwars,vader and darth plagueis
3870,starwars,yeah man looks like he’s choking
3871,starwars,your helmets are pretty impressive
3872,starwars,kinda so most of s7 is set during rots right before order 66 and the last 3 are set right as order 66 starts
3873,starwars,some
3874,starwars,that’s a completely different incentive and there’s conspiratorial thinking at play there
3875,starwars,well thats a pretty tall order for that hunterfirst of all in my own home my own home where i have a 10 foot tall gate and 15 foot fence surrounding my 4 acre property as well as having just under a dozen firearms 5 functioning real steel swords 3 ballistic resistant vests and a security camera system good fucking lucksecond of all kill meall 6 foot 213 pounds 6 years of formal mma training and a decade of firearms handling of me must be killed bwahahahahahaha if they do get a killing blow on me its because ive buried a sword in their chest and they wont leave my eyesightthird of all took my child as a snackmy own flesh and blood child that would be a literal hellion to try and grab for anyone but my significant other and myself and the people we gave our child to hold again more good fucking luckhypothetical scenarios are fun as fuck
3876,starwars,your helmets look amazing i bet a fatty vader helmet would be really hard to pull off
3877,starwars,malgus looks badass here my fav sith lord
3878,starwars,yeah but even if it was real its not a good defense of the scene
3879,starwars,she also fights kind of like palpatine does for a few of her moves
3880,starwars,i think some of her reluctance was her being realistic about her own inexperience in training jedi as well as or because of grogus attachments and anger
3881,starwars,&gt; you wouldnt mock a fan of your companys work and then put that as your twitter banner responding to this buddy
3882,starwars,&gt;when anakin goes to visit padme and the queen says padme isn’t there is that queen actually padme or is that kierrai know this is late but i think both are padme padme was getting ready to make the speech when anakin came and she didnt want to reveal her real identity she just said padme is away
3883,starwars,great style would love to see other characters as well
3884,starwars,amazing make as in you modeled it
3885,starwars,better than justifying killing for no reason in a completely hypothetical situation how would u feel if out of the blue a hunter imvaded ur house killed ur ass and took ur child to trade it as a snack its doesnt need to be logical  its empathy that i am talking about 
3886,starwars,ultimate circle parry
3887,starwars,middle right is malgus
3888,starwars,i thought battle meditation was what bastilla shan didand it helped her allies or something
3889,starwars,how do you make them round
3890,starwars,the slave i has always been my favourite its so unique and it sounds cooli really like the mandalorian fighter gauntlet too
3891,starwars,
3892,starwars,
3893,starwars,who is the middle left and the bottom left
3894,starwars,okay youre just gunna blabber in circles have fun getting a circle jerk going on about a completely illogical issue 👉👉
3895,starwars,did you totally missed the question mark at the end it proposes a question not an admission of fact
3896,starwars,but at the end of the day  its not going to do anything but die in some other way thats the case with everyone no  i dont eat meat
3897,starwars,i just did that with lego star wars 3
3898,starwars,i think youre over-reactingits a wild animal it has a level of intelligence and deserves to be respectedbut at the end of the day its not going to do anything but die in some other wayi have a question do you eat meat
3899,starwars,is it just me or does it look like an arm
3900,starwars,i like the idea that obi-wan having successfully attacked using a leap from below studied this move to prevent himself falling victim to it if this is true and obi-wan did indeed teach anakin everything he knew then anakin would have known that attacking obi-wan this way wouldnt work but was so angry and overconfident he decided to try it anyway
3901,starwars,so basically  a mudhorn was minding its own business in its cave with its egg  someone comes in and wants to take its child away so it gets killed and the egg gets eaten as a snack and u are justifying it dont get me wrong i love mando but that rhino didnt deserve this
3902,starwars,well we know what he can do as a fully embraced sith because of what darth vader can do he killed obi-wan
3903,starwars,and a badass mask
3904,starwars,dude it’s more than dlc it’s more like a whole ass game lol i’ve been waiting for years for it to come out
3905,starwars,what kind of scratch did you use
3906,starwars,a special nod to my fellow ncr brother
3907,starwars,what do you mean
3908,starwars,yes in tcw when boba sneaks aboard the venator to kill mace the slave 1 attaches to the escape pod boba is in
3909,starwars,
3910,starwars,sebulba is the best star wars character of all time bar none
3911,starwars,thats a weird bit of whataboutism
3912,starwars,is just a big dog
3913,starwars,cool thanks i’ll check it out
3914,starwars,mandalorians: oh i dont think so
3915,starwars,i agree on the lazy writing i think the sequel trilogy had every reason to succeed cast effects sound $$ i thought the characters were good rey looked like a jedi to me poe a star fighter fin a storm trooper turned rebel should have eventually turned jedi thought the chemistry between him and rey from the start was strong and it kind of dissolved in 8 and 9 all good characters i feel like they all got short changed and let down from the top  out of all the different possibilities/avenues you could take the story  they took it in the easiest most predictable way you could not to mention they had a chance to really set up more films if the sequel trilogy started with lucas’s idea of “when an empire crumbles chaos initially ensues  crime syndicates and terrorist factions can all arise to take some plunder meanwhile luke is training a new order kylo/rey/fin could have all been a part of that or some variation of them” bottom line to me the sequels are giant big wasted opportunity
3916,starwars,never saw a scabbard for a lightsaber
3917,starwars,damn ig i know the answer
3918,starwars,also a big metal head not really a fan of that kinda music but the man was talented as fuck
3919,starwars,never had this issue with lego reallymega bloks i did thougha lot
3920,starwars,there is no good side or bad side because everyone thinks he’s doing good from their perspective
3921,starwars,damn that looks cool looks like ill be redownloading new vegas again hopefully that will scratch the fallout itch until fallout miami releases
3922,starwars,okay being a life form doesnt equate to being able to have the ability to wake up one day and think i know im hungry but i wanna go play insteadan animal is led by instinct and is not able to shirk those boundarieswhile the life form was there them jawas eating that egg is no different than me or you eating chicken eggs
3923,starwars,fourth one asks me if this is the real life
3924,starwars,miniaturized death star tech itll crack that door open like an egg - finn also calls it a battering ram cannon which implies its purpose is to bust open the doorpoe at the beginning of the movie saved the lives that he put at risk by continuing the attack the resistance was ready to jump/escape which he disobeyed the themes are in fact entirely consistent
3925,starwars,
3926,starwars,after
3927,starwars,spot on
3928,starwars,image for sure
3929,starwars,he was looking for more than ferris
3930,starwars,anakin skywalker was weak i destroyed him
3931,starwars,thr gif or imagr
3932,starwars,order to watch:-movies 1-2-clone wars series-movie 3-rebels series optional-solo-rouge one -movies 4-6-mandalorian-movies 7-9
3933,starwars,huh i completely forgot about that part tbf he was distracted by the arrival of the clones so i stand by the fact that it wouldnt have been an effective way to end the fight earlier especially since we see him recover so eaily but thanks for calling me out there
3934,starwars,you sound like an imperial officer
3935,starwars,wow nice
3936,starwars,botched character in a botched movie
3937,starwars,instagram bad
3938,starwars,i dont get it  are u saying that the egg didnt had a lifeform inside it
3939,starwars,&gt;i have to think about what my opponent is about to do time to put my sword behind my back so that he may slice my gut open while i do that
3940,starwars,it the grievous one is the best
3941,starwars,general kenobi you are a bold one
3942,starwars,this made me laugh so much 😂😂😂
3943,starwars,rip christopher lee: count dooku count dracula frankensteins monster and saruman what a legend
3944,starwars,nah nah nah hows man bout to film in his underpants thats out of order
3945,starwars,why do i get the feeling youll be the loop of me
3946,starwars,indeed yoda speaks with osv word order
3947,starwars,didnt know that
3948,starwars,it is but many people dont accept it
3949,starwars,oh aight fair enoughweird that one egg was it took to get his ship stuff back
3950,starwars,im saying if obiwan really wanted to actually defeat grievous then he just opens with a force lift or shove grievous doesnt always have a claw full of ground youd see that every time he takes a step if you do it fast enough or before he notices then he isnt grabbing everythingand what makes you think he cant always just grab the ground when being force pushed he does it literally any time obi-wan tries it
3951,starwars,it was the egg of a wild animal that may be partially sentient with its obvious ability to feel physical painit was not the egg of a sentient and sapient beingi was saddened by grogu eating the frog lady eggs
3952,starwars,
3953,starwars,i was just grabbing a link to the new book for a friend who’s due to get a bunch of credits but the light of the jedi doesn’t even show up in my search anymore nor if i go to the page directly from google does anything show up guess i’ll find out in 3 days if i get it
3954,starwars,like others in this this post i spent a good amount of time playing these games after school when these games came outlots of good memories this is so cool
3955,starwars,that wasnt food that was someones baby
3956,starwars,i’ve seen that t-shirt before but never actually though to try to check what it said on it; that’s very cool
3957,starwars,beskar
3958,starwars,i hate it when he loops that
3959,starwars,if star wars was in a galaxy a long time ago you must be descendent of mace windu with that purple lightsaber nice
3960,starwars,where’s darth jar jar
3961,starwars,so parry against a parry
3962,starwars,idk prying them apart after theyve been damaged and grievous is disadmed is easier than attempting it at the start of the duel when hed have to focus while dealing with 4 lightsabers at onceand what makes you think he cant always just grab the ground when being force pushed he does it literally any time obi-wan tries it
3963,starwars,oh im not brave enough for politics
3964,starwars,bro i want that
3965,starwars,this whole thing has such a rambling stream of consciousness nonsense feel to it that at first i thought it was a copypasta i hadnt seen before still not 100% sure it isnt
3966,starwars, you can see more here: 
3967,starwars,i seem the same concept at play thoughan attack from either would result in a parry by the other no
3968,starwars,
3969,starwars,im the 69th upvote
3970,starwars,like father like son
3971,starwars,that line from obi-wan is still in there
3972,starwars,
3973,starwars,not selling any at the moment sorry you can download it though and put on a canvas yourself if you want to
3974,starwars,i bet my life that if lucas still had control over the franchise he would remade this and possibly some other scenes using todays technology this fan made scene would inspire him to do so
3975,starwars,fantastic now that i see it like this i have to agree it obviously must have been intentional so many great things to explore in them time for another rewatch
3976,starwars,sickkkk love the hello kitty helmet on left too
3977,starwars,okay and what im saying is adding such a story changing aspect without giving any meaningful context takes away from the story about space wizards and robots if you think its suitable thats okay lets agree to disagree then
3978,starwars,
3979,starwars,mauls return cheapened obi-wans victory in tpm palpatines return cheapened anakins victory in rotj reys resurrection cheapened anakins paranoia in rots ahsoka surviving grievous maul vader and palpatine dying and getting resurrected and a second time was saved by time travel made these villains not that scary and inevitable death became evitable etcin conclusion i dont care that much anymore if someone miraculously survived death in star wars as long as the story is good
3980,starwars,i found 8 to have very strong moments among the best i’ve ever seen in star wars but the overall arc of the slow starship chase and the as it turns out pointless chase after a code breaker dragged the movie down i felt there were too many twists that were more sensational than narratively motivatedi found 9 to be the opposite it had many questionable and brief scenes that needed more explanation and a better setup but in general the movie had a clear and focused target the interaction between rey and kylo was arguably strong but i agree with many others that the movie would have benefitted tremendously if it was longer7 is really good as well on another day i would probably ranked it higher i do like the ambiance in these sequels they really do remind me most of the ot and regardless of some of the choices they are fun to watch
3981,starwars,mauls return cheapened obi-wans victory in tpm palpatines return cheapened anakins victory in rotj reys resurrection cheapened anakins paranoia in rots ahsoka surviving grievous maul vader and palpatine dying and getting resurrected and a second time was saved by time travel made these villains not that scary and inevitable death became evitable etcin conclusion i dont care that much anymore if someone miraculously survived death in star wars as long as the story is good
3982,starwars,twas early in the morning when he rode into the town
3983,starwars,he gave it to the jawas to get his ship back this was in season 1
3984,starwars,wheres jar jar binks
3985,starwars,yeah i guess your right
3986,starwars,life can be harsh sometimes
3987,starwars,im saying that the length and ridiculous silly set pieces detract from the dramatic weight it didnt need to be a ridiculously long protracted dual anakin and obi would have surely wanted to end the fight quickly obi wan would have especially wanted to incapacitate anakin without killing himyou get no sense of that simply a utterly sterile looking special effects sequence that is only memorable for its denouement anakin and obi wan at the end of the fight is what you remember everything before hand is fan service
3988,starwars,this is the way
3989,starwars,if obiwan can pry those treated durasteel plates open with his hands he can definitely do it with the forcealso no grievous doesnt always have a claw hold of the ground
3990,starwars,
3991,starwars,we don’t see an external shot of the ships docking but i think it might be like the millennium falcon at the being of tros
3992,starwars,
3993,starwars,can i commission you to do one for me
3994,starwars,oh its canon the story is just much dumber than people here would like  obi wan really did go into hiding and change his name to the completely cryptic old man kenobi and forgot 100% of his saber training dune this story is not
3995,starwars,
3996,starwars,how i wanna learn to make such things
3997,starwars,
3998,starwars,
3999,starwars,imma try this one more time i have no desire to discuss this horrible film with you any further i thought i had made that clear several times overi think the film is trash you enjoy it imho there is nothing left to be saidonce again please move on
