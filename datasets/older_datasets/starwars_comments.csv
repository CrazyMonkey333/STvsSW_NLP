[],,sirkaracho,,,[],,,,text,t2_o329j,False,False,[],"It makes logical sense, but only with the explanations. Not showing such important things about charackter development is just bad storytelling. Also from episode 8 onward a major intent wasnt to make a good narrative, but to fuck up everything the movie before it established, especially TLJ following TFA.

If it all makes sense for you this way it is ok. I mean i myself think for example not hinting how batman came back to gotham in DKR is bad too, but i can live with that. In DKR it is just some plot point though, in the sequel triogy it is an important part of the story that has to be interpreted.

My interpretation is that lukes situation in ROTJ was much much worse, and he still came out on top and not stood on the good side himself, but also saved another one and took him back rom the dark side. In the sequel trilogy he should even be stronger in his connection to the light side, but they ignored that just for shock value or whatever, i dont know, they werent interested in making a coherent new trilogy at all.

I can accept flaws like this one if the whole thing would be a well made trilogy, but the only good things are the designs, production values, and some of the actors. So it is more me looking at the sequel trilogy as a pile of crap that is still genunely fun to look at as long as the camera isnt zoomed all the way on reys face showing the same trembling emotion every time (as much emotion as that papercraft of a character can have).

If someone has to explain something like that in a movie that isnt meant to be a thinking mans movie, it just is a flaw. Pretty much every movie has flaws. But the sequel trilogy is almost nothing but flaws only held together by the brand name and amazing adiovisuals.

Maybe i am not the right person to talk to here, because maybe it is more meant to be like ""hey i have an idea how this coud work out"" kinda thread where my response would be more fitting for a ""you all dont realize how good the sequels really are"" thread.

As I chew the food for you, what I‚Äôm saying is Favreau decided to make Baby Yoda 50 as a direct response to Kennedy‚Äòs comment. You see because Kennedy commented that only 50-year-olds care about the original trilogy, so I‚Äôm saying Jon Favreau made baby Yoda 50 for that reason. So basically Baby Yoda could‚Äôve been any age like five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, but no. Baby Yoda is 50. And, I think this is where you‚Äôre getting lost, the reason he chose that number is because Kathleen Kennedy made that comment about 50-year-olds caring about the original trilogy. You see Kathleen Kennedy didn‚Äôt think anyone under 50 would care about the original trilogy, and Jon Favreau disagreed with that. So he decided to write a show about a 50-year-old baby Yoda that gets rescued by the hero of the original trilogy. Maybe that‚Äôs too hard to you know what I‚Äôll keep going.

Your essay reads like a meninist manifesto, justifying abuses of power and acts of violence.  It‚Äôs pretty cringe that you‚Äôre using sex drive as an example for the claim ‚Äúno one is truly guilty, everyone is innocent‚Äù.  I wonder what kind of things you are willing to overlook because someone can‚Äôt overcome their desires.

It‚Äôs pretty established that our genetics and upbringing have a major impact on our behavior.  Yet, if we use these things as a justification for behavior that is predestined, why not start preventing it by labeling people as likely to commit acts?  Would the council have been justified in executing a young Anakin, if they were able to sense what he was going to do?  This steps into ideas of pre-crime prosecution.  Anyone coming from an abusive household should be locked up, because they are the most likely to continue the cycle.

In this thread, we have two kinds of people.  One kind seeks to justify actions by saying that the perpetrator had an excuse, and their horrible actions are excusable.  The other says that no matter how awful of a life someone leads, they still have the ability to be a good person.  We, the latter, learned this from the very circumstances you say we are enslaved to.  We overcame.  That is true strength and power.  The former is weakness of character and fortitude.

I know I won‚Äôt convince you otherwise.  You might never see the merits of accountability in your lifetime.  You will probably go on excusing your poor decisions as a product of your own biology and upbringing.  You‚Äôll just go through life as a slave to it, as opposed to master of your own destiny.

This sounded very strange to me, so I did some research and first of all, she never said this in regards to Luke Skywalker specifically.

It was about the original plans for Galaxy's Edge being Mos Eisley, but it was redesigned as a totally new and unique thing instead of 'Something fiftysomethings remember about Tatooine'. (Meaning: rebuilding a 50-year old set from memory)

And second of all, there's zero evidence that she actually said this.

This 'quote' comes from someone who heard a second-hand account of a meeting between Bob Iger and Kathleen Kennedy.

This is not a direct quote, it's a game of telephone with at least three degrees of separation, it was not about older fans and it was certainly not about Luke Skywalker.

It's believable to drastically change your mindset after a traumatic experience. It's not believable to change your core characteristic behavior. Instead of him being just disillusioned (which would be fine), he's also rude, messy, and uncaring. He throws the lightsaber away, he ignores Rey, tells her to go away, and spends the entire film just being a jerk. Who is this rude asshole? Where is Luke? Luke, disillusioned or not, it is very hard to believe that this is the same character. This appears to be an entirely new one.

He‚Äôs uncaring? What?

TLJ portrays a Luke that cares deeply about everything. He‚Äôs so affected by what happens, he goes into isolation. He clearly wants to help, but is paralyzed by his fear and guilt. 

These other traits (rude, disillusioned) are symptoms of that guilt. He‚Äôs trying to rationalize his errors. He‚Äôs doing what we all do. But TLJ as a movie doesn‚Äôt let him get away with that. 

&gt; Ask yourself, what character traits does TLJ share with ROTJ Luke besides the name? 

They‚Äôre both highly emotional, caring, quick to act/react, struggling with fear/darkside, and ultimately good. They‚Äôre the same character. 

What‚Äôs Luke‚Äôs defining trait in the OT? His struggle to control his fears and combat the darkside. That‚Äôs a lifelong struggle.

The only real winners in the Star Wars universe are the corporations making all the gear for the war machine.

Violence is essential in life. It is one manifestation of power. If you argue against that, you argue against the need for a police, for a military etc.

Since there is no free will, no one is truly guilty, everyone is innocent. When we punish people by law we do it under the illusion that they had a choice. This illusion happens when the causal chain of the decision these people made is not clear or perceived as not essential, although it always is essential.

Anakin, as everyone else, had no free choice. In his specific instance, his Jedi order indoctrination couldn't complete fully because he was old when coming into he order and more talented than everyone else. Then he started to develop a substantial sex drive and therefore married. Now the false visions of Sidious started, as well as the order shitting on Anakin. Now Sidious offers him saving his wife, but he has to do his bidding unconditionally. Again, since Anakin has a pretty big sex drive and also since Windu shitted on him, he agrees. He now does his bidding, including slaughtering the younglings. When Padme arrives at him he chokes her out of anger since he thinks she betrayed him and she was the one he risked everything for.

Now, how could this have went differently? Not when the boogeyman free will made Anakin do different. But when the causal chain simply was different. For example, when his genes made him less talented, less sex drivy, when he was indoctrinated earlier, when he was treated better by the Jedi order or whatever else could have influenced his brain. But he had his fate like everyone else.

This doesn't mean that we shouldn't punish people for doing things. That's fine to keep order. But when we do it we should be clear about doing it to keep an order, or better: to keep the world as we, the people in power, desire it to be. And we shouldn't invent free will, to then invent moral, to then invent guilt, to then feel like these people deserve their unlucky fate as if they could have changed it, to then feel like we deserve better, instead of just admitting that we overpower them to keep the world as we like.",,,1609607495,{},ghub68i,False,t3_kodzbd,False,True,t1_ghu6com,/r/StarWars/comments/kodzbd/anakin_skywalker_why_do_people_defend_this/ghub68i/,1609607792,1,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,,0,[],,

Yes, TPM created the Chosen One Prophecy and that's exactly my point. It retroactively made Anakin the most important character in the series when it was originally Luke. And that doesn't gel with the OT when it's clearly meant for Luke to be the important character. 

&gt;And imo Luke isnt hope. Blowing up the death star was the hope, it showed that the rebellion had a chance to fight back no matter if luke of biggs or whoever made the shot.

Well, yes, that's hope for the rebellion. But the title ""A New Hope"" is in reference, objectively, to Luke. It's said in dialogue throughout the movies. 

&gt;People tend to forget that star wars started as ONLY ANH and Only went on due to the populairity of this movie. As far as I remember there was no multiple movie deal. Thats Why ESB starts so abruptly with a time skip.

I didn't forget, but that sort of works towards my point that there isn't perfect flow between the movies like the OP suggests. George wrote on the fly. Somethings he had planned, many he didn't, and others he changed. Even in the OT he retcons quite a few of his own ideas. But then in the prequels he doubles down on the retcons. 

And that's fine. It doesn't really bother me and I enjoy all of the movies. But pretending that these movies are consistent and flow to each other is not really accurate. And that's why it bothers me that the sequels adding things, changing things, etc bothers so many people when George started doing that with his 2nd movie and never stopped through his 6th movie.

If you have problems with the actual content, that's fine. But propping up the prequels as these consistent stories that flow perfectly with the originals where the new movies don't, that's just not really that fair to say. Like, I understand that are a lot of people in the ""prequels good, sequels bad"" camp but I think some of that mentality puts blinders on and they praise aspects of one but not the other and then hate on aspects of one but not the other.

It really is an excellent show. Far better than any of the movies with the exception of rogue one and The Empire Strikes Back.  

Lucas was always saying that he views Star Wars as a kids show whenever adults would complain about how crappy the movies were. Well it‚Äôs ironic that the cartoons deal with the subject matter and story of Star Wars in a far more compelling and exciting way than the movies did.  

I never really thought Vader was that scary or tragic. (except for the end of rogue one which shows you how powerful and terrifying he could be) The Clone Wars does an excellent job of making you care about Annakin in ways the movies fail at and so when they come to an end and annakin becomes Vader you really do get a sense of how tragic it was.  And speaking of scary....the ending of Jedi Fallen Order did an even better job of showing you just how powerful, terrifying and ruthless Vader was. 

His fight with asoka in that episode was chilling and very sad. And when his mask was damaged and you hear him speak both in his normal voice and the voice of Vader....gives me the chills every time I watch it.

What I would say, I think a lot of the film is about fleshing out the Resistance beyond the characters we know. Leia is removed for a lot of the action, and though we expect command to fall to Poe because we know him, we‚Äôre taught it doesn‚Äôt actually work that way; there‚Äôs a larger story at play, with other characters that we haven‚Äôt met yet but are still important. 

Moreover, Holdo knows little about Poe besides the fact he‚Äôs just been demoted for his actions against the Dreadnought - he succeeded, but at a cost so great the Resistance struggles to survive it. Given survival is the key under Holdo, she makes it her sole focus, even at the expense of transparency. It makes us dislike her, but that‚Äôs the point. She makes a tough call, one that we don‚Äôt get to understand until Poe does so that we join his journey of character development from loveable-but-reckless hero to a true Leader of the Resistance and a protege of Leia. 

So yeah, for me anyway, Holdo was cagey but she had to be like that, so the Resistance could survive. It‚Äôs messy, it‚Äôs infuriating, we side with the character we know until we (and Poe) learned she not only had a plan but a reason for keeping it secret. 

The Last Jedi is challenging. It‚Äôs the most challenging Star Wars film because it goes against what we expect at a lot of times. I love the film for that.

First, why was Poe demoted? Literally, why? What was the plan? He talks trash, takes out some cannons and that alone is enough to give their evacuation time? Hell no. The entire point of his attack was to soften a key target. Clearly their (shit conceptualized) bombers and fighters were prepped and on standby. If the whole point was to wait for Poe to pew pew a couple turrets and flee, they would not have craft and crew ready to come on the wing commander's call. That he was demoted shows how bipolar Leia was and calls her competency into question. 

Second, the attitude Holdo showed was trash. Period. You have all command staff gathered just to walk in and say you're in charge? Nothing to even address basic ideas? Not even going to say the situation is being assessed and to stand by for further orders? Thats just plain awful. To be antagonistic toward Poe shows how vapid she is and exposes Johnson's own garbage attitude about leadership.

I‚Äôve done a Legends deep dive into the content up until and including the Bane trilogy (novels and comics) and it was fun as hell. There‚Äôs only 11 novels from the Before the Republic and Old Republic time period, and most of the lore-building is done through the comics.  

How you want to approach obtaining the comics is up to what you‚Äôre willing to spend. I was able to put together a list of the various comics needed from Wookiepedia, then I‚Äôd track down which ones were in omnibus, trade paper back (TPB) or Epic collections on eBay.  A lot are not collected, and for those you‚Äôd have to track down individual issues. Most of the arcs are around 5 issues long, so you can usually buy them together, and if you are patient they aren‚Äôt too expensive. Be warned though, a few story arcs or Epic collection volumes do get pricey, but if you are patient and are a completist it can be affordable.

I‚Äôm diving into the games KOTOR 1 and 2, and SWTOR  right now, as they continue the lore around this period and are actually key to a lot of what happens in the comics/novels.

This period is 100% my favorite period in Star Wars (37000 BBY - 1000 BBY), and while not canon, most of this period doesn‚Äôt have major conflicts with the PT-OT-ST saga. 

For the Legends stuff that occurs PT-era and onward, there will be major conflicts starting post-ROTS.  However, the Plagueis novel, and all three PT movie book adaptations are great, and you can brush off some of the canon/legend conflicts. The Marvel Clone Wars comic Epic Collections are worth reading, but once again, you‚Äôll see some conflict with the CW canon series. Lastly, Shatterpoint is probably my favorite Legend novel from this period, but the use of one of the characters in Rebels yanks this novel out of canon unfortunately.

You're braver than me in going through the entire Legends in order. I am doing it as a much smaller scale in doing the Dawn of the Jedi era book and comics. Then moving on do a reread of Old Republic era with Tales of the Jedi comics, reread KotOR comics, play KotOR 1 &amp; 2, and reread The Old Republic tie in books.

I will probably then watch some YouTube story playthrough videos of The Old Republic MMO, as while I own it, MMO games aren't my thing.
