I recognize there are a few places to indicate no/none; however, the second from the last question does not give someone an option to indicate they don't express their fandom anywhere (online or in person).

From here, I'm going to provide unsolicited advice, feel free to skip it if you're not interested. As a preface, I genuinely believe all students should engage in the research process at some point in their study. I think what you're doing is an incredible first step in learning about the data collection process. I spent three years working in a research lab and my advisors were specifically focused on creating and evaluating reliable and valid methods of assessment, so my perspective is heavily filtered through that lens.

With that said, I see that this is for an undergraduate study, and I imagine an advisor is working with you on your research. I'm curious if you are working with a co-advisor in the psych department?

Are you doing a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods study? If you're doing a mixed methods or quant study, it would be helpful to have a doc student or prof in the psych department look over the questionnaire and provide some suggestions for how to improve reliability and validity of the measure. While I understand you're an undergrad student and the expectations will be different, I think it's incredibly important at all stages of study to at least attempt to address reliability and validity of assessment measures or be aware of how reliable or valid your measures are. Too often, both in research and in life, we create data measures that are biased, and leading, that ultimately serve to validate our beliefs about the topic we're attempting to study. 

Even if you don't make changes to your survey, it would be helpful to know to what degree it is a reliable and valid measure of your questions. 

If you're running a mostly qualitative study and reflecting on individual responses, nothing would really need to change. If you're attempting to draw conclusions about fandom and run any sort of quantitative analysis of your results, I'd strongly recommend addressing the reliability and validity.",,,1609616308,{},ghusf8b,False,t3_kowsif,False,True,t3_kowsif,/r/startrek/comments/kowsif/star_trek_fandom_survey/ghusf8b/,1609617617,1,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,,0,[],,

I think a lot of us wanted this, and they are also realizing it with Season 3 where some characters get more screen time, although still not enough. I do respect what they were trying to do with having a main character which isn't a captain, but I don't think they delivered it well which is why there are many criticisms on Michael.

 2-3. I think you enjoy episodic Trek (Like TOS) than serial Trek (Disco). There are ways they could have achieved this eitherway, but because they try to push forth more action, more drama, problems that are so big that everything is urgent, all that ends up taking up most of the time and they can't do actual exploration. Exploration is one of the top things I liked about Trek, so it was a bit of a let down, but this is something they've established since Season 1, that Disco would be about action and conflict and not really.. uhh discovery.

4. Disco is progressive in the LGBTQ sense, although it is very in your face. I wish they wrote that better, but I guess it's better than nothing. I get why they have to bring up federation values, because it was a time of war. The easiest way to win the war is not the federation way, and you could see it when they had to utilize mines in Season 2 even if it was forbidden. But yes, I do wish they reduced the speeches, show more and tell less.

5. I get that Disco would have some leeway because its an exploratory vessel, but Michael did get away with a lot. This is mostly because it is written such that although she disregards orders, her actions will lead to good and success. Some plot armor that she needs because she's a non-captain main lead. Not defending it, because if they wrote things differently she wouldn't even need plot armor at all.

6. They were inclusive in casting, but yes they were not able to fully showcase all the cast. As with #1, they broke off from an ensemble setting and now they cant pull back without it being too sudden or break away from the action packed episodes.

7. Yeah, that would be tough with Disco. The seasons are just solving one big problem and they take you to an action packed ride to the end. I enjoy it as a scifi show where I just generally turn off my brain and watch. 

8. For the time jump, I think they were forced to do it because they had to follow the original series, and original series spock does not have a sister. This is easily avoided of course, if they just wrote Michael differently, even just a minor change to her background and who adopts her. For the mirror timeline, I found it fun. Certainly an interesting twist in season 1. But when they did it again on Season 3, it was still fun but it's jarring because it deviated from the Burn plot.

9.  This would be fun, but I guess because Disco is serial they can't do this. It would put a sudden stop to all he action and drama they're trying to build up every episode.

10. True. Disco not only has the spore drive but also has the sentient planet thing whatever. And truly there were no efforts to replicate the tardigrade DNA for the other star ships cause Discovery needs to be special~ Spore drive is interesting though, but it seems unlikely that there aren't any downsides to it.

I'd they also have non-dedicated warships but its unlikely they are going to be sent into combat.

Now the Federation seems to make a multipurpose design to ship building, atleast before the dominion war. They make their ships where they can fit combat, exploration, research and so on packed in one ship. Then optimize the ships systems based on what the ships primary task is going to be.

I'm sick of it being ""the Michael show"" and I miss the science. TNG was technobabble sprinkled onto real concepts, but DIS is real concepts sprinkled into technobabble, and they rarely actually have scientific discussions.

How the hell is Discovery going to inspire kids to be engineers or scientists when all we get is a random clip of them staring at a screen waiting for analysis? It's like the writers think that's the boring part that needs to be quiet part.

I've never seen a show squander the few things that could have been really great. Captain Pike was amazing but oh... he needs his own show.

Saru's arc was great but they keep undercutting him with Michael, Tilly, their history of replacing captains every season.

Tilly could have had an excellent arc over the series. Lacking confidence and bumbling when nervous, feeling like the Barclay character, deciding to work on herself and focusing on training, taking command training against everyone's judgement (kinda like Troi), really suffering through it but constantly working on herself, then by the end she's surprisingly capable.

Going to the future opened so many new possibilities. The Burn is lame plot writing crutch IMO, but what's worse is that somehow Michael does a bit of digging and she finds info? A whole galaxy of scientists couldn't get some of this?

For example, go to the [season finale discussion thread and sort by controversial](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/7wxkla/postepisode_discussion_season_finale_s1e15_will/?sort=controversial):

&gt; I have so many questions

&gt; Why did the writers make our characters go to a sex club and then have Tilly do some drugs? Was that really necessary? Are we supposed to take that Mirror Georgiou is bisexual? Why would the show do that? Who wanted that? In fact, who even wanted nudity in Star Trek? Like, who asked for that? I certically didn’t!

&gt; Are we supposed to seriously believe that General Cornwell (and co) decided to destroy a planet. And then changed their mind after some brief words from Burnham? Also: what is it with New Trek and destroying planets?

&gt; Why did Starfleet hand L’Rell a nuclear bomb? Why did Tyler go with her? Why does nobody ever have to answer for any of their crimes in this show?

&gt; An absurd and moronic first season - the worst first season of any Trek show, utterly and generically average, with not a single original or interesting episode - comes to an end. The writing here was painfully on-the-nose, every emotion and meaning telegraphed bluntly. The contrivances were ridiculous, and the attempts at ""idealism"" delivered poorly by a show whose droll realism simply cannot handle more abstract philosophizing.

&gt; Like most soap operas, Discovery makes you feel obligated to watch, and manipulates and steers conversation with its gimmicks. This is writing by committee, advertising executives, and corporate PR experts. Totally cynical.

&gt; Well that was just terrible. At least I can finally stop hate watching this show. They took what was beautiful and fun about Star Trek and turned it into whatever this was. Dark, angry war imagery all season long, awful tie up loose ends writing, and the slap in the face ending with the Enterprise showing up. And they use Alexander Courage's is original beautiful theme music over the credits. No way Gene Roddenberry would have okayed any of this season. I've now seen it once, and unlike every other iteration of Star Trek, I do not want to see it again.

&gt; So Michael Burnham saves the entire galaxy. yay..

&gt; good job writers

&gt; Why so much BS ""feels"" and long speeches ? 

&gt; Stupid ending. Stupid Burnham. Principles are all we have?? Really! What about the billions of lives on earth whose fate you put in the hands of l'rell.

&gt; I have been thinking about the episode all day and how I felt about it. I worked, came home, watched some reviews on the ""YouTube"". I find that I do not care. This coming from a guy who cares a lot for the franchise. If this is an attempt to get a new audience by pissing off over half of the people who like the franchise, I think they have succeeded. It's like fanboy fiction for narcissists. They keep banging me over the head with bad writing and unbelievable plot direction and then change direction because they got tired. I like all the star trek franchises but this one grates on me. Were there some good story lines? Yes, but then they went into a different direction. I feel empty, much like the show.

Rom may be the most obvious example, but aside from the Grand Nagus Zek, *all* of the main Ferengi characters are, in some way, screw-ups by Ferengi standards. And therein lies the critique.

Rom doesn't have the lobes for business, but as his son notes, he's a mechanical genius. Nog is a tenacious and disciplined worker, but he's got poor social skills, and he's got a chip on his shoulder. Moogie is a financial wizard, but she's female in a society that officially discriminates against them. Even Quark, who is the best adapted of the bunch, nevertheless won't cross certain ethical lines that the Rules of Acquisition say you should cross without compunction. All of them, in their own way, poorly realize the Ferengi ideal, and all of them are cast to the margins of Ferengi society as a result. Only Quark is able to eke out an existence, and that's usually portrayed as pretty meager and small-time.

Which actually makes for a far more compelling critique of Ferengi society than TNG was able to offer. TNG, hamstrung by Roddenberry's writing, presented the Ferengi as the worst aspects of colonialism, capitalism, and imperialism. Then they presented a race that visibly did none of the three very well, two not at all, and had them jump around like hamsters on angel dust for good measure. It wasn't an effective critique, because the Ferengi were so obviously presented as to be worthy of contempt, for reasons that had little to nothing to do with ideology. 

But showing a functioning society that nevertheless casts really valuable people to the curbside, simply because they lack business acumen (or in Moogie's case, the ability to show her face in public)?

Capitalism is a method for distributing limited resources. Technology in a post scarcity world mean there are no limited resources anymore, or at least few enough that it doesn't cause quality of life issues.  You don't need a system to apportion resources when you don't need to apportion resources anymore.

Capitalism doesn't have to mean inequality though...you're assuming some kind of zero sum system where every winner has to have a corresponding loser too, but that's not the case, especially with post scarcity.  Even before that, increases in general wealth and economic vitality raise everyone's effective wealth - a rising tide can raise all boats in capitalism.

Another way to examine it is to look at ""purchasing power""...ie how much you can get with the capital you have.  You can probably roughly define middle class as ""able to get everything you need"" and wealthy as ""able to get everything you want"".  Because replicators and holograms effectively reduce the cost of goods and services, respectively, to zero, everyone has extreme purchasing power and, thus, is functionally rich and can stop thinking about money and focus on higher Maslovian goals.

Again, that's not a repudiation of capitalism.  That's just it becoming somewhat obsolete.

Starfleet does believe in at least a similar concept. Remember what Riker told Troi in her command test?

&gt; Also be mindful that the prime directive wasn’t originally designed for Star Trek for the purpose of being a foil against Captain Kirk. It stands for the purpose of showing that Kirk is moral and would do the right thing even if it’s against the rules. See TOS, “The Apple”.

Yeah, Kirk did the moral thing like Janeway did. Remember The City on the Edge of Forever? Kirk chose the needs of the many there too.

&gt; But also note that, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one, is a moral quandary. It’s an ethically horrible rule that is basically stating the desires of the mob can be used to run rough shod over the smallest human minority, the individual. It’s communistic in nature and reflects the worst aspect of democracy. It’s why the US was formed as a republic in the first place. 

It says ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" not ""The needs of the many let you run rough shod over the smallest human minority"" lol.

&gt; I would say that Tuvix death is analogous to the train which is on a track running toward five people. Janeway chose to switch the track so that the train would kill only one allowing two to survive. But ethically this is murder. Whereby leaving the situation as it stands it’s just a by product of random chance or the unfolding of circumstances over time. To take no direct action is equally undesirable, but it is more ethical as it doesn’t initiate the act of murder in the first place. 

To deliberately take no action is making a choice to kill multiple people. Kirk and Janeway got that :)

The fallacy of this argument is that the first couple seasons of TNG, DS9 and Voy are objectively terrible.

Fans' criticisms of those shows when they first launched were accurate and honest.  Once those shows improved and only once those shows improved did they win the hearts of the fans.

It's certainly possible for DISC and PIC to become as cherished as older trek.  Those older shows made huge improvements in quality and the fans rewarded them with their love.  However there is little evidence to date that the flaws in the new shows will be corrected and to simply dismiss criticisms as fans being fickle is insulting.

The other scenes I can think of with comparable tension and focus on acting would be in In the Pale Moonlight, and if just focused on acting, there would be additional Garak scenes that would qualify. Although, Garak feels a bit overacted compared to Vance, perhaps because of how poor screen quality was then vs now and how much you would need to emote to sell a performance on a blurry CRT vs crisp 4k.

I think the closest thing I can come up with seriously would be the Wounded scenes with Maxwell or the final scene with Gul Macet. Which aren’t really negotiation per se, but carry some of the same weight.

Also be mindful that the prime directive wasn’t originally designed for Star Trek for the purpose of being a foil against Captain Kirk. It stands for the purpose of showing that Kirk is moral and would do the right thing even if it’s against the rules. See TOS, “The Apple”.

But also note that, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one, is a moral quandary. It’s an ethically horrible rule that is basically stating the desires of the mob can be used to run rough shod over the smallest human minority, the individual. It’s communistic in nature and reflects the worst aspect of democracy. It’s why the US was formed as a republic in the first place. 

I would say that Tuvix death is analogous to the train which is on a track running toward five people. Janeway chose to switch the track so that the train would kill only one allowing two to survive. But ethically this is murder. Whereby leaving the situation as it stands it’s just a by product of random chance or the unfolding of circumstances over time.

For example, while it was a highly unstable and imperfect solution, a nuclear arsenal on both sides during the cold war prevented each side from engaging in an all-out conflict as it would have meant mutual destruction. This same power dynamic may be what enabled the creation of a treaty between the Romulan Empire and the Federation of Planets, as I can't see any other reason for why the Romulans would agree to such a treaty. 

However, on a smaller scale it is different. Whenever it is not a clash between the Empire and the Federation but instead between individual spaceships, the enemies of the Federation regularly seem to have the upper hand. Would it not be wise of the Federation to match the firepower of their enemies? 

At second thought, it might also be a different issue entirely. The Panzerkampfwagen VI was considered one of the most powerful tanks in WW2. However, less than 700 were ever produced. Thus, having superior firepower in individual units wasn't enough to defeat the over 30k tanks that the Soviet Union had in T-34s alone.

We even get to know Garak's father, and we come to understand how he is as a person. It spreads out. All of this depth was present in classic Trek because they made sure to give us layers upon layers from the very beginning. Discovery has no layers. It's all superficial. 

And they keep presenting us with big climactic emotional moments all the time, as if it's going to move us, somehow (and make up for lacking depth). But this just loses its effect. Michael Burnham's massive Messiah-pathos just comes across as tiresome and overdone. Is there nothing more to it than this? Somehow I am more interested in Paul Stamets than Michael Burnham.

 I think, your example of Picard is telling. It a modern story, from the same franchise, made almost simultaneously, and focusing on one character. But one focuses on a beloved (especially to this sub) character and Disco does not. So, one gets a pass, and the other is wistfully and critically compared to television from the 90s. The point I was trying to make!Indeed the ‘valid criticism,’ of the OP post has the masthead of a picture of the TNG crew. You continue to explain to me how it is not like Star Trek from 30 years ago. Ya, it is not. And that is a good thing, for a franchise and philosophy that is forward looking...”infinite diversity in infinite combinations,” as Star Trek doesn’t have to fit a mold, because it is bigger than that. But, sure, the mould is fine with Picard though. I wonder why? Two more comments:

1) where was this show promoted as an ensemble show? I knew I was getting the Michael Burn show from the first trailer, as it focuses on her, go back and watch. And if it didn’t get if from then, I would definitely after the first few shows. Where you think it was pitched as an ensemble show, because it wasn’t, from the very first trailer. Why watch and complain 3 seasons in. It is like not liking Indian food, after walking into an Indian restaurant, and complaining about how it is not McDonalds. So weird. As shout from the roof-tops as, pc master race, or vegans, you just love a thing, we get it TNG loving sub, but you can like other things too. Try some curry, it is good. 

2) I feel that I know a considerable amount about the characters. Perhaps more about their personal lives, wants, quirks and background than I did I the first 3 seasons of (definitely) TNG, and (mostly) DS9 with fewer episodes. I think this show goes a long way towards character development of its main cast. But perhaps that is just me. 

Lastly, you are wrong about ‘Conscience of the King,’ it is not another member of the crew that get obsessed, but Kirk. The show opens with another survivor who is convinced the actor is it is Kodos, (Simpsons), but is murdered. This happens in the first few minutes. This Obsession is then transferred to Kirk. O’Riley is unaware of Kodos. McCoy actually yells at Kirk about his brooding on revenge, in the scene where Spock and McCoy confront Kirk. Like the original trailer of Disco, you should look those up, to make sure I am correct. The Menagerie is a clip show, cannibalizing the original pilot, so the focus is away from Kirk and Spock, but I would argue the emotional weight of the show is still Kirk, the puzzle, sure, Spock, but as much time if not more is on Kirk and what to do about his friend that he has to put to death. Spock works the slide projector.  Kirk is still swaggering about in that show too.

DS9 had 46 episodes for its first 2 seasons (I liked S3 but Worf doesn't show up til 4x01 and I know people who consider this to be when DS9 picked up). Voyager had 42 episodes for its first 2 seasons. When do people say Voyager picked up? 7 Of 9? Again, that's basically S4.

The scene with the Sheliak was great but it was resolved with a quick gimmick: Picard finishing a loophole in the rules and relying on the Sheliak to honour it despite their best interest. Yes, it was establish earlier in the episode that the Sheliaks were extreme sticklers for rules, but it still feels forced to me and requires slightly to much suspension of disbelief.

I also love the kidnapped Lwaxana scene, but it's a comedy negotiation, it works only if you accept that the Ferengi is a moron.

What both those two scenes have in common is that they don't play like both parties are equally capable and smart and coherently follow their objective.  Also, in both scenes both parties objectives are explicit and very simple.

In the Vance/Osyraa scene both are credible actors, smart, and true to their interests. Their objectives are complex and not necessarily explicit .
Osyraa, for example, wants at least three things:
* To better the economic prosperity of the Chain, threatened by the shortage of dilythium
* To enter the partnership with the Federation being the stronger/dominant of the two parties
* To maintain her personal power and ensure her legacy

I don't actually hate the episode but it's also not one of my favorites anymore. It used to be. It's just a little too long for my liking. I'm a bit, let's say, satisfied with episodes of good folks held hostage by bad folks, trying to find their way out of their hopeless situation while not attracting attention of the bad folks' gorillas. That's why I also don't really like the latest two episodes of DIS. It's too obvious. Too much ""good always prevails, no matter the price"" and ""well, who's gonna be killed off next?"" as in the extremely annoying Negan seasons of The Walking Dead. In the TNG episode where Yar died it was very much unpredictable because killing main characters wasn't really a thing back then. Especially not as part of the main plot. That got only acceptable for the broader audience with Game Of Thrones and The Walking Dead. And it kind of makes the shows arbitrary. If it happens too often, you avoid building a relationship with the main characters to avoid negative emotions when they are killed. And especially in a situation like that of Rick and his friends and family who got terrorized by Negan multiple seasons, it really gets annoying after a while. Good thing they didn't do that with The Most Toys. But what I feel about it has changed drastically since I saw it first, particularly because of the hostage-taking plot which had been reused a hundred times in so many different shows, not only star trek. It's boring and annoying. I hope they'll end it soon in DIS and will never play this plot again. It's the second time now if I remember correctly (first time was Harry Mudd).

I understand there are some truly die-hard fans of the DS9 relaunch novels but I don't know where to start you off on those.

All the artifacts of Trek are more so just background for what is otherwise a typical 90’s Mexican Soap Opera, but in space.

Nearly 80% of the show is padded by characters rattling off repetitive over-the-top emotional speeches with characters “meaningfully staring” into each other’s eyes for no reason as one of them is “in distress” and the other is giving them a pep talk. Either it’s Michael and Phillipa. Or Michael and Saru. Or Michael and the Trill Non-Binary Girl. Or Trill Non-Binary Girl and her ghost Non-Binary boyfriend. Or Michael and Tilly. Or Tilly and Stamets. Or Stamets and Hugh. Or Hugh and Detmer. Etc etc. It’s the exact same scene, the exact same dynamic, replayed with different characters over, *and over,* ***and over again.***

Meanwhile I'm struggling to recall episodes but I don't think Geordi ever had an existential problem with his VISOR, if anything I think he was probably grateful to have it.

The problem with modifying the environment, is that you can't modify the whole world (or in Star Treks case, the universe). If I recall correctly, part of Meloras problem was that the DS9 being a Cardassian space station, was simply not easy to retrofit for her needs. Not only that, but she didn't want to be limited to working in a low-G environment. She *wanted* to go work outside of low G environments and that was much of the focus of the episode.

They just couldn’t do that to the entire station because everybody else on board would struggle with that from essential crewman to the large civilian population.

They could have tried other adjustments though instead of just plonking her in a chair. In real life we can make artificial arms that react to pressure and the electrical impulses in nerves endings to open/close/rotate the hand as the wearer wants no reason why in Star Trek they couldn’t make some kind of exoskeletal suit type thing that did the same allowing her to just walk around. Her movements would be a little slow/jerky but otherwise nothing to stop her doing what anyone else does in normal gravity.

I’m pretty sure there was a tos episode with a woman who turned out to be completely blind but wore a sensory net that allowed her to know the proximity to things and therefore move about normally.

Just imagine how hard her death episode would have hit if we'd known her like Tasha Yar or Jadzia Dax.

Worf adopts an orphan who promptly stops existing next episode.

Episode 6 - The Booby Trap

LaForge Isn't gay he's just awkward and creepy and lots of other old stereotypes about gay people.

Episode 7 - The enemy.
Almost the same plot as Masterpiece Society, which was the better version of the two.

Episode 9 - The Vengeance Factor

I honestly don't even remember this one that well in spite of seeing it multiple times, which I think says a lot. I do remember it being fairly cringey and feeling slow and like old timey tv.

Episode 14 - A Matter of Perspective

A remake of the 1950's Japanese movie Rashomon. Rashomon was sexist and rape apologia even for it's time. TNG decides to one up Rashomon by changing it so that it's about a woman making up a rape accusation in order to bring down a good man.

Episode 18 - Allegiance. 

I almost filed this away under mediocre, not bad. It has some of the hammiest acting not just in Star Trek but in TNG specifically. Not the hammiest, but it's up there. I feel bad for mentioning it, because if we include bad acting as a reason to dump on an episode then there isn't much Trek left. But, seeing as everyone is dumping on Discovery's acting I feel like it's important to remind people really quickly about some of the acting in previous series.

Episode 21 - Hollow Pursuits

There is some good stuff in here. It's nice to see a member of Star Trek that is neurodivergent and not perfect. Honestly, all of the characters should have more issues and mental health problems, or they should have to take large amounts of time off periodically in order to receive therapy and or meditate or whatever.
All of that aside, what Barclay was doing in the holodeck has to be some kind of sexual harassment / assault. I get it was supposed to be funny. Barclay makes Riker short, Riker doesn't like it and wants to shut it down. Troi stops him. They come across a fuck doll version of Troi and Crusher. Then Riker, who is their boss, tries to laugh it off throwing Troi's words about not being sensitive back at her. Was Barclay's representation of Riker and other male crew members disrespectful and inappropriate? Absolutely. Is that the same as what he Did to Troi? No way in hell.

Episode 24 - Ménage à Troi

The Ferengi are established to be raping, abducting, sex-slavers. This is referenced throughout various series, including DS9, where Ferengi's are routinely apologized for because they are supposed to be endearing or something.

Episode 25 - Transfigurations

Some alien needs help. He has magic powers. He's evolving into a being of pure energy and his government is trying to stop because they're scared of change. Also, Worf dies and is resurrected almost immediately.

We followed you hu followed you.” And you could tell how painful it was for Michael to eject him from discovery. But and big but here, Michaels character has been the worst this season.

You have Data (operations/science), Worf (security), Geordi (engineering), Crusher (medical), and Troi (counseling), and Riker (XO), and maybe someone directly related to the problem, with Picard (diplomacy). Usually they are solving a problem for one planet or the ship.

When has that *ever* happened on Discovery?

You’ll get Saru (communication?) and Michael (Science), sometimes Tilly (More science), and sometimes Stamets (spore science), maybe Vance (diplomacy), maybe Georgiou (oppression and murder), or someone directly related to the problem. Hugh mostly hangs out in Medbay and ends up cleaning up their mess. Often the overarching problem involves the whole multiverse, universe, or galaxy with the immediate problem being planet/ship related.

Yes, the crew is demographically speaking more diverse. But the perspectives they show them bringing onscreen are less diverse. Half of them don’t even show up when they’re figuring out what to do. It really cuts at Discovery’s message of there being value in diversity due to differing perspectives when Michael can singlehandedly solve the problems of the galaxy better than it can, no matter what time period she’s in.

Picard does a pretty good job in *Die Hard in Space* but that was just as much wit as actual fighting skills. Most of the time he isn’t shown having much knowledge of specifics about a subject area, and his impact is fairly limited if he is acting purely on his own.

Ditto for Sisko, who has more combat/engineering experience but less diplomatic experience. But he simply cannot work at O’Brien’s level.

Janeway can help fix the warp core and has science knowledge, and is perhaps more well-rounded. But bear in mind, people have a similar complaint about Voyager centering too much around Janeway, Seven, and the Doctor. It’s not a complaint exclusive to Discovery.

TNG-My first Trek, will always have a special place in my symbiote pouch.

ST-If every episode was Calyspo or Q&amp;A this would be higher. Now I ship Number One and Spock and I’m still not sure if it’s ok. 

LDS-Its funny and it’s nice to see the TNG aesthetic, though I wish they would take more advantage of the animated medium. I want to see some more crazy stuff. 

PIC- I really liked, even loved, the Romulan stuff and most of the characters. A lot of other stuff left me feeling kinda meh. Really dislike how Jurati was handled, and I’m disappointed that Narek apparently won’t be back next season. He’s off to plot with the parasitesfrom Conspiracy I guess. 

TAS- If more episodes had the Skorr, their Jihad and their ability to field 200 billion bird warriors in just two years, this would be #1.  I love how batshit crazy some of the episodes are. 

VOY-Yeah I’m not sure it deserves the last spot, but something has to go here. I do like it the least out of all the treks, but that doesn’t mean there’s not still a lot to enjoy.

Personally no 1 to 4 are amazing and very little in between them. I ranked dsn higher the tng cause the characters were so well done from quark to garack and so many others the added so much more to the show the tng. Also dsn was more darker which i enjoyed a bit and think it showed a much more realistic captain in sisko rather than tng unealistic perception of a perfect captain in picard. Aswell as this i believe some of captain picards philosphies were flawed.  Enterprise is very underated and stands very well by itself but comparing to the other top 3 lacks the eloquency they had.

With TNG, on the other hand, Picard was not only the main character but the captain of the ship. It makes sense for him to be involved in most episodes given that he's the one running the ship and the ultimate source of authority.

Discovery doesn't do that. It's all Michael, all the time...

To me, Star Trek is an ensemble of people but into difficult situations, that need to be solved with respect, intellect, and ethics.

Discovery has none of that. The cast is essentially Burnham, Phillipa (who is just there to show Burnham how to be a bad person to get things done), Saru (who is just there to be a stickler, almost an opposite to her to show her horrible behaviour might be better than star fleet regulations), and Tilly (who is just there to try make Burnham look fun, when she’s not, like at all). Now we have book I suppose, but he’s an odd character, he can talk to animals and it’s just been totally forgotten.

The rest of the cast is literally completely replaceable. As we have seen, given the stupid deaths and removal of cool captains like Lorca and Pike.

We have watched all Star Trek series and movies (sometimes several times) and we also miss that sense of Star Trek. Sure, Enterprise before that had also lost a bit of that sense, but then the show was meant to be a bit rough, since there was no Federation yet.

From a European perspective: I get that there is a culture war going on in the US and so they needed to put a lot of stuff in, be it a female black lead, an openly gay couple, at least one trans actor (depending on whether you count her vision or not), and that would all be perfectly fine if those guys at least did something and were developed.

Michael is supposed to be a human child that grew up in Vulcan. When it suits the story she is vulcan, and when it doesn't she is human. Other people here have written enough about her as a flawed character who would have lost her job long ago, so I won't focus on that. But what exactly is the point of the Chief Engineer now, and what is his job exactly? Sure, Geordi was always the go to guy for everything and the distinction between Science Officer and Chief Engineer has always been rather hazy, but damn. He is basically reduced to being a father figure, a husband and the guy who does things downstairs. And there is this other Engineer who is also kind of there to annoy Stamets, and other than that she does what exactly?

And Adira? It seems like they decided to put her in at the last moment, so she is always kind of there and gets to have some ideas, but what is going on with her exactly? I want character development, I want to know how she plans to live on, what she wants from life etc etc.

Nilsson: she is kind of there and apparently has an important job, but I could not for the life of me tell you what she does and why an Ensign was chosen over her. Sure, I get it from the writers/producers perspective, because the actress playing Tilly checks of another box in the political correctness field, but making her First Officer and pretending that she is even close to being officer material (or starship material) just exposes the glaring weakness of structuring a show not around the ""science"" part of science fiction, but around the ""fiction"" part",,,1609582886,{},ghte9wu,False,t3_kobpfv,False,True,t3_kobpfv,/r/startrek/comments/kobpfv/lifelong_star_trek_fan_with_valid_criticisms_of/ghte9wu/,1609582897,1,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,,0,[],,

There are two main situations where you can store a person's pattern:

1. In the pattern buffer. This is where you're supposed to do it. The pattern buffer is designed to store patterns. But only briefly. It has some prepostrous amount of storage space, but can't hold that information for very long before the pattern degrades. Scotty somehow manages to keep the pattern stable longer.
2. In the ship's computer. This is only done in weird emergencies. The ship's computer is designed for longer-term storage, so it can potentially keep a pattern stable for longer, but the computer isn't designed for it, and doesn't have the storage space to comfortably accommodate it. It can work in a pinch, but you may have to dump a shitton of data and software to fit the patterns in.

If you want to store that insane amount of data you'll have to fill up the entire ship's/station's computer, which causes all sorts of problems. When I said ""computer-intensive"" I was being rather vague, but I was referring to the computer's storage capacity rather than its computational capacity. If you have to dump important data and software to keep a person alive in there, well maybe that's necessary to save a life in an emergency but I wouldn't want to be doing it every time the away team beams down.

The biggest refutation to what I'm saying is probably when Voyager just straight up stores people in the pattern buffers to hide from some space nazis who kill psychics. If you can just keep people in *the pattern buffer*, which is only used for transporting people and wouldn't cause ship-wide problems, well then you're onto something. The pattern buffer is suggested to have plenty of space to store many patterns, but its limitation is that it can't store people for long. Perhaps Voyager has tweaked their transporters with nanoprobes or some shit, they always seem to be tinkering away at something or other.

Point is, it's trek tech, if you're looking for rigid consistency read an Arthur C Clarke novel or something.

You have a point, and I like the comparison, but people really need to stop saying ""X is just a remake/rip-off/copy of Y"" when the two things *are nothing alike except in one-sentence high concept synopsis*.

*It's A Wonderful Life* and the short story *The Greatest Gift* is a Christmas story about the importance of life, every single life, and valuing the impact you have on those around you and is preaching against committing suicide.

""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is a time travel story about the impact of doing the right thing, even in martyrdom, and is ultimately about being willing to risk your life to do what is right because even if you may lose in the moment, you may help set things in motion that will bring about a better future for the next generation (pun intended).

Saying these two are the same story except with minor tweaks is like saying ""Cause and Effect"" is just a rewrite of *Groundhog Day* with Bill Murray because they're both time loop stories.

First of all, TOS lacks modern storylines that focus on relationships and character development. So you don’t have a primary focus on Kirk’s family/relationships, his emotions or dialogue between other characters focusing mainly on him. He has no permanent relations outside the crew on screen that influences the show. Even in for example, The Conscience of the King there is very little talk about Kirk’s actual reactions to the massacre on Tarsus IV or what it was like. Kirk isn’t the one who wants revenge or wrestles with that, it’s another member of the crew. In the Menagerie, Kirk has to make decisions but the story is obviously not about him emotionally. In Balance of Terror, he’s the strategist but it’s Spock who wrestles with suspicion from other crewmen and eventually saves the ship by firing the phasers. 

Any other of the more modern Treks prove my point. In none of them is one character continually written in as the center of everything because they are ensemble type series. Picard is different and that’s obviously because it’s supposed to be about him. 

Discovery is pitched and cast as an ensemble type show and written like a show centered around a single character.

I'd add on all of the interpersonal relationships. Odo and Kira. Odo and Quark. Jadzia and Quark. Quark and Rom. Rom and Chief O'Brian. Chief O'Brian and Julian Bashir. Bashir and Garak. So on, and so forth. You have these little relationships with their own mini stories. Garak and Bashir have lunch together. Odo loves Kira. Both Rom and Nog want to work with the Chief and learn from him, but in very different ways.

[],,LeftLiner,,,[],,,,text,t2_2x70w76x,False,False,[],"&gt;So you're saying it would be okay if there was no Kirk, no Picard, Sisko, Janeway, Archer... I can't see how that would make sense with all the storylines that we've had over the years.

Well... no, obviously I'm not saying that if you were to just delete those characters from the show and leave it at that, the shows would still work. There wouldn't be a captain of the Enterprise - the should would become a joke with an empty chair in the middle of the bridge.

What I'm saying is that let's pretend we're creating TNG back in 1986. We're writing our characters and we're starting with the captain, but instead of creating Jean-luc Picard, we create Vladimir Koskova, a russian. And he's not just Picard with a different name and accent, he's a different character alltogether: Unlike Picard he's a family man with a wife and a young child, both posted on the Enterprise. And unlike Picard he's not quite at the prime of his career but rather a rising star - he's cocky, full of drive - intelligent and diplomatic like Picard, yes, but perhaps with something left to prove, and more to lose. He still drinks tea.

If we did that, the show would get a very different dynamic than it did in real life. Koskova would interact with Riker and Worf and Data in different ways to Picard, so we would have to approach those relationships anew.

But how much of the show itself would actually change? Would some stuff? Of course! Samaritan Snare, Family, Tapestry are all episodes written \*about\*, rather than simply featuring Picard, and those episodes would make no sense with Koskova. Just like Wrath of Khan is written \*about\* Kirk rather than simply featuring him.

Best of Both Worlds would get a different dynamic (what with Koskova's wife and child being on board as he gets abducted) but apart from that nothing would really change. BoBW is not a Picard-focused episode, it's all about Riker, and the Borg didn't kidnap Picard because there was anything special to him but because he was the captain of the flagship. Koskova would still be that.

There is nothing inherent to Picard's character that is needed for TNG to work. He's well-written, and the cast is well-balanced (once they iron out the kinks after a season or two), but the show is not \*about\* Picard. A handful of episodes would either need drastic re-writes (all would obviously require \*some\* degree of re-writing) or get thrown out completely if we replaced him with Koskova. But that's all.

I maintain the same is true of Voyager, and DS9. With Archer I would consider the argument that his backstory with his dad and his subsequent prejudice against vulcans is important to the show, so poooossibly Archer is actually integral to Enterprise. Sisko is a grey area to me, his character is very much one which informs his approach to the station and Bajor, but again, there's nothing in the show that \*requires\* that the commander of DS9 be a widower, or have a son. Yes Jake does get a bit of a storyline that makes... a little less sense if he's not the son of the commander... maybe. Not sure, again I'd listen to arguments on this.

But if you did the same to Discovery, it falls apart \*immedeately\*. You can't change who Burnham is because the show is \*about\* her in a very distinct way. If you replace her with someone who isn't Spock's adopted sister, you have no season two arc. If she doesn't come in as an outsider half-vulcan, most of season one doesn't work. If her mother wasn't the one with the time-travelling suit, again season two falls apart. Discovery is written \*about\* Burnham, in a way no other Star Trek show was written \*about\* the captain. The captain was just an important character. Some episodes were written about them, just like some episodes were written about every character on every show, and most movies focused heavily on Picard especially, but the shows didn't orbit around them.",,,1609574370,{},ght66ox,False,t3_kohk9f,False,True,t1_ghrflxt,/r/startrek/comments/kohk9f/all_this_talk_about_burnham_being_the_center_of/ght66ox/,1609574380,1,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,,0,[],,

That’s the point that I’m getting at; Trek writers love to position powerful women in a negative way when, really, they’re just doing their jobs and/or dealing with male subordinates who are being shitty to them. The “angry woman” trope extends far beyond Trek lore and takes on other dimensions like the “angry black woman” trope (misogynoir). 

Clearly you’re continuing with bad faith interpretations. One can offer commentary about the overwhelmingly male writers writing scripts for women characters and offer different commentary about specific character’s behavior in a given moment.

A big case-in-point is the Season 3 sub-plot with Georgiou. She starts having health issues relatively early in the season, that develops as the season progresses until we get a two-parter where she ""returns"" to the Mirror Universe some months before she originally left. We get to see a contrast in her character in that she's changed since coming to the Prime Universe (despite her protestations to the contrary). It also sets up her return to the Prime Universe's past (probably 22nd Century that she left from, but we have to wait and see). 

DS9 had a number of episodes that could have benefitted from this kind of story telling. Like Chief O'Brien getting a 40 year prison sentence carried out virtually in 5 minutes.

So i skipped S3 because i feared what you describe. That the show would focus on Burnham to me she is an inherently unlikable character. Quick to emotional outbursts (despite being raised by vulcans), violent and emotionally highly unstable.

The Creators of the show are talented, no question about it. The actors are amazing, makeup is amazing and the CGI is well and truly top notch for a TV show. So the writing has to be completely terrible to sink this one and whoopdy doo. It is. The writers and showrunners give the extremely strong impression that they would actually like to do something else. That startrek isnt their thing. They know its about ""Federationy and sciency thingies"" and while having all the information about it. They lack the soul and passion and go out of their way to not be Startrek.

Their Trip to the year 3000 is proof of that. They dont really want to do startrek. If they did they would focus on the Neutral Zone, the Romulans and so forth. Its that timeperiod and there is a whole lot of startrek waiting to be told. From a lack of Passion, carelessness is Born and thus weak scripts. Season 2's villain (control) alone is an example of how utterly inept the writers are. It displays a level of willful ignorance to the Topic (A super advanced AI) that can just be explained with ""Season2? Meh whatever, timetravel and Evil robot sound good. So we can get away from lore and tell the stories we actually want to tell.""

So thats why i avoided S3. I had no indication that it would get better. So get this, in 2020, the year of no Entertainment and general dreadfulness, me as a SciFi hound skips freaking Startrek! Thats not nothing! At least not to me.

Time to make your day :)

There are 55 weeks in a year. CBS currently has these series in production: Discovery, Picard, Lower Decks, Prodigy, Strange New World, and (untitled) Section 31 (show).

Even if every season has 10 episodes (and Discovery has always had more so far) that's 60 weeks. For a streaming service one Trek after another makes sense to keep people subscribed. And while I don't think it was ever confirmed it appears that was the plan starting with Discovery S3 after Picard, but then Covid happened and Discovery got delayed while Lower Decks got bumped up.

FWIW I remember similar critiques of DS9, especially in seasons 6 and 7, but also complaining when we spent time in S7 exploring Ezri. 

DS9 S7 is an interesting study. The final arc was 10 episodes long. That’s basically a Discovery season by itself. Add to that the setup in the first three episodes and that’s it. There were a lot of standout stories in s7 (Take Me Out to the Holosuite, Siege of AR-558,It’s only a Paper Moon, Inter Arma) and some fun ones like Bada Bing... There isn’t really room for those kinds of stories AND serialized storytelling which seems to be necessary now. Ironically, Su’Kals story which is pretty traditionally Trek feels out of place in Discovery because of the slower pacing. 

The issue of the bridge crew I can forgive to some extent - Sulu, Uhura, Chekov et al really didn’t get much development before the movies. Mayweather was tragically underused. Troi and Crusher together always very failed Bechdel. 

I’m not sure how much of this is Discovery versus Star Trek clashing with what TV demands now. A good comparison is Voyager. TNG rode on Roddenberrys coattails and DS9 was syndicated so the producers got left alone. Voyager has always bothered me because it felt like a wasted opportunity.

Okay, I get it. More than in past series, Micheal is the main character of Discovery (**get over it, people**), but even still the number of ""events"" centered on her is still fewer than Picard had. It's a *extremely* weak argument against the show, especially when Discovery *does* elevate its other characters quite a lot! It is an ensemble show, it really is.

For the record, I'm totally fine with all those old storylines for Worf and Picard, even though they strain credulity (especially with Worf over the years, yeesh). My point was that if you take the OP's criticism at face value, *no* other Star Trek series passes that test, and ""but it's not an ensemble show"" doesn't make it any more logical a position, even if I accepted that for the sake of argument.

It's fine to not like the show. Some people like oranges but don't like tangerines, even though they're pretty similar. Those feelings are valid.

Each of these were clearly the points made there, all of which underscored the mental, intellectual, and physical degradation of a man at the end of his life with a defective parietal lobe. You also should have expected more from Picard as it pertained to how he addressed a senior Flag Officer, the goddamned Commander in Chief of Starfleet I’ll remind again, not chide the woman who used a bad word you didn’t like. Therein lies the implicit misogyny of your argument. The implication here is clearly reminiscent of the “Bitch Admiral” derision so commonly used by Trek fans to describe women admirals who say mean things to main characters :(

Second, your first and second counterassertions belie your own implicit biases about language coding. “Mild” and “severe” cursing? What kind of heuristic is this? What are its generic boundaries? What is the metric by which you make this decision? Can this be applied elsewhere? Why is “goddamn” not considered a major curse? Similarly, why not “shit?” Neither of which are welcome on broadcast TV, I’d add. The point is, the heuristic you’re using to qualify what kind of curses are welcome in Trek breaks down into meaninglessness with the slightest amount of scrutiny. (More broadly, and not to the specific point of this comment thread, this is why I push back so strongly on the “genre-fication” of Star Trek as this stable thing. It’s clearly not.)

I never did any such thing. I told you my experience as an RN in a military organization, directly responding to your previous comment. Please do not put words in my mouth.  Indeed my experiences are anecdotal, but quite fitting to the situation you presented, which is why I chimed in. My point being: those youtube videos you've seen are, in my professional opinion, the exception, not the rule.

I was stationed in South Korean from the end of 2019 to last month.  I didn't see my wife and son for 370 days due to COVID. During that time I was an inpatient nurse for the only bedded Air Force facility on the Korean Peninsula.  I saw people try to commit suicide by drinking bleach. I saw people shot in the face. Horrible motocycle accidents. All that while managing our response to COVID. 

My peers, subordinates, and commanders were like a family because we were all separated from ours. So I take issue with you implying I discount stories of medical professionals breaking down during this pandemic.  I lived it, but we remained professional at work. That was my experience as it related to your comment. Again, I know you've seen youtube videos of RNs or MDs breaking down, but I gave my real world account of it, so don't put words in my mouth, please.

The rest of what you posted is whatever, you're free to have your opinions about a TV show.

It's crap like this why I rarely engage in online discussions.  To think that I'd give a real world perspective, and then be accused of discounting ""all the stories from doctors and nurses... that have been completely overwhelmed.""  It's just ridiculous.

I became good friends with a writer, and at some point started doing notes for him as a favour, and it went from there. If you're friends with any writers, ask them if you can read their scripts or drafts. There's often a lot they can gain from an extra pair of eyes even if you're not an experienced editor or copy editor. It's a good way to find out whether you have an eye for it or not. If you aren't friends with any writers, start hanging out in writer twitter threads and see if it leads to any acquaintances. If you're into writing (or editing) already yourself, you can also find some suitable facebook groups and subreddits for your preferred genre or writing style and meet people on there.

I spent most of my childhood and youth reading and have a vivid imagination, so for me it's relatively easy to read a script and see a scene play out in my mind and remark on possible timing issues. I'd recommend getting into reading plays instead of novels, it's somewhat more demanding of the reader and most people find it less fun, but it will help a lot to train your brain to pay attention to the right things.

For another example... I've made graphic design my full-time work for now, and I kind of randomly ended up in a writing-related fb group (but more marketing-leaning copywriting), offered a random desperate person some help and advice and that led to my first book cover, and probably band t-shirts for the same guy this year.

Also let's take into consideration that Star Fleet is a military body, yet the crew in Discovery does not behave like in military, it's more like a trade ship that happens to have some star fleet personnel.

Also ST Discovery is forcing itself to be controversial like ""in your face"" with having a Gay engineer and medical staff, instead of treating that with a ""normal in the future"", the same with Tal and Gray characters, to much in your face that they are transgender and non-binary, that relationship is so forced, there is no chemistry between the characters. They can use the same circumstances (gay, non-binary and transgender) with no issue and not forcing it, making it more fluid into the story, I love the fact that they show this diversity!, because it's real and NORMAL not need to ""in your face because it's not normal""

Way to much drama the dr and the engineer ""I love you but I need my space, but want to be with you, but no so much, but may be try again, but it's too much"" it's annoying. Also the relationships of Michael (with the Klingon-human and with Book) are useless fillers, not adding anything to the story, just drama for the sake of drama.

No consistency in the story:

\- The ship is sentient and is protecting us - yet it does nothing against the Emerald Chain

\- The red angel suit has auto-pilot and self destruct - yet I refuse to use that and pilot it myself

\- The ship computer can be locked to avoid being controlled by other people (like when they return from the mirror universe and the Admiral took control of Discovery) - yet they didn't use it

\- The ship can jump anywhere in the galaxy in a blink of an eye - yet we decide to stay next to the nebula and confront the emerald chain (this is the more annoying for me, they use that ship at war because of that feature, they could jump back to Federation HQ, wait a little and then jump inside the nebula and rescue all the team, then jump back to HQ, and prepare to fight the Emerald Chain)",,,1609559072,{},ghskqt4,False,t3_jyugah,False,True,t3_jyugah,/r/startrek/comments/jyugah/why_people_hate_startrek_discovery/ghskqt4/,1609562022,1,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,,0,[],,

And yes other characters have some stories I apologize for my hyperbole, but he is the main character, by most measures. Even leaving aside the backstage machinations by Shatner, well documented, that kept it his show,  he was always the primary focus and star. Sure, for instance “for the world is hollow and I have touched the sky,” has a McCoy emphasis, but even in this show Kirk is the mover and shaker, the one who, like Burnham, saves the day. I would think this was obvious. Find me a show that does not have Kirk swaggering all about it, and I will concede. 

But the rest of your comments are about taste, what this whole thread is about, and what seems to have upset everybody.

Along those same lines, the bond between Georgiou and Michael (and the rest of the crew, honestly) didn't feel earned from a viewers perspective. And that had a lot more time invested in it, with more than enough opportunity. In fact, most of the actual 'connection' came out in the episode where she... left the series... 🤔

So I get that. :P

But here's why I can give a pass to Stamets, Culber, and Adira despite only having a handful of episodes devoted to it. They established the bones of it, narratively. It was pretty clear that Stamets had taken her under his wing and took a near-parental shine to her. 

They also established that a lot of time has passed in-between, off screen with the refit and stuff. Not a good excuse, since that kind of thing also held true for Georgiou and Michael, but it's part of my calculus. ;P

Finally, I kind of feel like this was a new ""thing"" for him. Like, we're seeing the climax of it all. Maybe even he didn't realize how much this would affect him. I mean, check the sequence of events in the episode:

- He was already in a panic over Culber being left behind, but he's doing his duty

- With the boarding of the ship, the clock was ticking (the nature of the questions given to Emerald Chain scientist show where his head is at)

- Michael swoops in and saves the day

- Stamets finds out Adira is ALSO down there with Culber

- Worse, Michael is putting Discovery and his spore driver *over* the lives of people he's grown attached to -- now MICHAEL is the bad guy (for him)

- Suddenly feeling alone, finding out BOTH of the people he's emotionally invested himself in are in danger, and this asshole -- this cause of ALL THEIR PROBLEMS IN THE FIRST PLACE -- is going to *let them die*. Oh god, it's all happening AGAIN.

- Yeah, he's gonna lose his absolute shit and unload on her... and she's gonna neck pinch him.

This worked for me. It requires a little bit of filling in the blanks in-between episodes, and there's even an argument to be made that maybe he got attached too quickly.  But it's an extremely human reaction. It surprised me, but it didn't exactly come out of left field.
