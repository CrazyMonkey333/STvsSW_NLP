0,and it is so damn touching each time   without having to beat us over the head with the emotions  a  harrumph   from odo is all we need 
0,that s a good angle too  if the premise that he was put on the station as a punishment  is false itself  then yes  this could all be really fully lies  excited to see how his story arc develops 
0,i m glad that show got a long enough run to get the cast shakedown out of the way so they could dig deeper into the characters remaining   improved scripts helped the whole show of course  but particularly helped characters like riker and worf 
0,i like how jonathan frakes just  is  riker 
0,hahaha  i m leaving it now  it s too funny
0,and change weapons panels that you tactical officers is used to so in a fire situation might not know where things are
0, gt  specials 8427   a message to you  borg y          i agree  though overall i felt  after watching voyager  that the borg were  less  scary overall 
0,that was my favourite   he was so good in that episode  a matter of honour  and that was pre beard 
0,as a direct person  i ve always taken him as just being direct  but i guess that could just mean i m a dick too haha 
0,he is so devastated that he has to deliver it  heart rending  and also so  so good 
0,disco bones is the hero we need but don t deserve  i so wish he had more screentime  shoulda kept the beard for the whole film   
0,i thought it was a half life reference  dr  eli vance 
0,relevant  ds9 version 
0,i always liked barclay and data as a young child  turns out i m intp   
0,just the way that man sits in a chair is great 
0,not just riker  but jonathan frakes is the man   saw him a few years ago at a chicago comic con with the rest of the tng cast and he was so personable  he saw my  four lights  shirt and yelled it at me ala picard  easily my favorite interaction with any celebrity 
0,one of my favourite star trek moments  tell me about your ship  riker  it s the enterprise  isn t it   no  the name of my ship is the lollipop   i have no knowledge of that ship   it s just been commissioned  it s a good ship  
0,the only other time i felt a chill from star trek other than that scene was probably when specials 8427 one shot borg cubes in the first 5 seconds of a voyager episode at the time you didn t know who fired the shots  just that the borg tried to assimilate someone and boom  they get blasted by something out of screen after all  what s more scary than something that makes the borge look like nothing 
0,he knows how to bring the smolder i liked his interaction with troi at the end of  man of the people   you could just see they were comfortable with each other and had each others backs  it was the best part of a pretty mediocre episode 
0,i watched the whole series recently  on average it s not bad  the only real problem is that when it s bad it s really bad  archer letting porthos  water  a sacred tree with a race they already know have a hair trigger   it has very few really great episodes compared to the other shows i enjoyed it  i even don t really mind the theme song  i ll never hold it up as the best of trek  but i can definitely see a rewatch in a year or two 
0, gt  even though it sent them in a time loop and it turned out his suggestion would have worked  oh the details  they could have done both people s suggestions not like it takes any extra time with all the time they talked  lol
0,true enough   i suppose i just don t trust the writers to competently explore the chain unless they are central to next seasons plot 
0,i always liked riker too   it takes a special kind of man to casually step over the back of every chair that he sits down in also  he made the goatee mustache combo look good  which is what inspired me to grow one over quarantine   
0,awesome op   enjoy 
0,lol pandemic beard  i thought the same thing during my apocalypse rewatch of tng 
0,but in fairness  you are on the star trek subreddit and it s rare to find anyone who will be impartial about tng here
0,i agree  riker was sexy with his flirtations  paris just seemed like a riker wanna be  he didn t have the same presence or charisma  though eventually his character did evolve into a more likeable one 
0,i would watch anything with garak  now that i think about it
0,president is an ai   cronenberg is its avatar 
0,potential title   oh  that kai  
0,there s room for both don t get me wrong  cough  ds9   but there can t be an absence of authority  discipline or competence 
0,i m rewatching tng for a second time  which episode is that 
0,i have tried to watch it several times  and     i just can t   i keep getting stuck on  broken bow  and i just can t keep going   i ve done a rewatch of ds9  voyager  tng  and tos  and then some   watched picard and     i just can t get into enterprise i said this elsewhere  but the show  with the softcore porn moments  archer saying  ass  as if he is looking for an excuse to say it  and the pewpewpew phaser battles   i m not 12 anymore  so it doesn t land with me i m sure it might get better  and i ve read that the fourth season is really good   i think i may just try starting there

0,true  but my dad looked like riker  spitting image 
0,fire at will      
0,i read that riker commented that he wished that they had cast soren with a male actor for that episode 
0,yes thank you   i m pretty sure this is the episode   i can t believe it didn t show up when i was searching for it   
0,the amount of times he s put the ship snd crew in danger trying to get laid   he s just a funny 
0,a lot of that positive traits you posted were traits all tng crew characters had  it s what made the show great 
0,personal opinion  i really didn t like ent   	seasons 1 2 were decent but nothing special imo   	s3 tries to be edgy and serious but it didn t really land with me   	s4 slows waaaay down and gets real boring  thought the vulcan thing would never end  lol   	the terra prime episodes just went ahead and  gt  kill trip and tpol s baby  lt  as an afterthought during the d√©nouement which felt lazy and disturbing   	the finale episode was actually not bad  best one in a long while imojust my opinions  we re all trekkies here  don t kill me pls 
0,he can only talk in flirt or yells 
0,i seem to be in a minority  i never liked riker much at all  he seemed to go from  one catalog pose to another   always entered the room shoulder first and was  smug beyond measure   
0,t baggin just one chair after another     
0,i remember watching it on air with family and my parents were both not interested in the time travel story and felt that it had been overdone  they sometimes would say that about voyager just a few years back so i m not sure where they initially started feeling like that with trek but they didn t like it  i didn t mind  time travel stuff was usually some of the best episodes  but then yes the end of the series is super strong
0,yes should be that one
0,he s my second favorite  right next to odo   
0,i don t want to hear excuses  get it done 
0,he was awesome there  one of my favorite riker episodes
0,to be fair tom hardy is too buff these days to play picard lol 
0,episode is shuttlepod 1 i believe
0,i remember being really disturbed and sad at that  frakes really sold it in just a few moments 
0,  
0,i really couldn t stand riker at first   the klingon episode you mention turned that around for me 
0,i think anyone in that circumstance would feel the same way especially when he has to worry about the lives of almost 2 000 people on his ship 
0,agreed 
0,i think enterprise has the most interesting scenario in star trek  the first crew on the first big boy starship for humanity  the ship is small and the uniforms are almost nasa like  functional  its more relatable to us 
0,i dislike enterprise in general  so i don t hate you     
0,personal opinion  i don t know why people say season four was good  in my opinion it was the worst of the show  don t hate me 
0,tracy 
0,not to mention let s change everyone s sleep and work schedule right as you re expecting a war to open up 
0,absolutely  yes  people immediately go to emotional places  and shut down  it s like you re attacking their identity  or implicitly calling them stupid if you criticize a thing they like  but that s what taste politics demand of us   you can only like things that are good  simply leads to people trying to justify and rationalize their totally irrational and deeply personal connections  those connections are valid and real and important  but they don t make something good i find it interesting that we can accept exactly this conversation when it s food  i d be hard pressed to find someone to claim that mcdonald s makes gourmet food  but plenty of people to say they like eating it 
0,paris comes off much more this way imo 
0,i love riker  he s great  my mom got into watching this show and she keeps complaining that he sleeps with everyone on the show and she rolls her eyes every time a new female character appears on screen  i guess its the era lol
0,it still is chilling when you are a grown adult  it s like if the wolfenstein series was real and the nazis did win 
0,its reputation seems better now than ever  but just about everyone concedes that the temporal cold war  while the germ of a good idea  suffered for the fact that nobody had any clear ideas about it 
0,in star trek it would either be moriarty or badgey
0,oh yeah i should definitely re watch it as well 
0,yea but what if ur in a program within a program 
0,given that starfleet was able to communicate with the cindi back in archer s day  why would they forget how to talk to them in star trek iv 
0,how about when he says  mr worf    fire  at the end of best of both worlds ep1  i think he had an amazing role in that  at the time i thought patrick stewart might not come back 
0, i suppose it was too much to think that that would work  
0,kai winn s acolytes are the redshirts of bajor 
0,the always flirting part ist why i still find him creepy  the overly confident body language doesn t help much 
0,agreed i won t re watch discovery again  even this season  except maybe an episode like  new eden  
0,thought the  s was implied here
0,patrick stewart is an executive producer  i m sure he has enough influence to get her a cameo at the very least 
0,absolutely  i agree  i genuinely don t know if i ll ever watch disco season 1  amp  2 or picard again  i disliked them that much  but i think your assessment is totally spot on  in some regards  discovery is a far superior show  taste politics   you should only like good things   tells us evening we watch should be prestige tv  the best films  etc  but that s a load of crap  there s nothing wrong with enjoying some schlock  but doing so thinking that  what i like is good  is where the problem is 
0,holy shit
0,well he is number one
0,i would love  love to see a crossover episode with garak and scorpius somehow 
0,these are the people who made picard a cyborg but made his new body as old as his original human one these fucking writers 
0,i subjectively believe the misconception that the goodness of a thing is always subjective has objectively diminished the quality of critical discussions about art in general  including books  tv  etc   i don t know where this misconception came from but it would be lovely if it went away and people were clearer in their own minds about which of their assertions are about their own subjective appreciation of a thing and which have to do with its objective quality e g   i subjectively really like malcom just because he s british even though as a character he is objectively flat  
0,ok i can accept this  i m game for it i think 
0,i know  right  literally resigning his friend to death
0,this is now canon    amp  x200b you nailed the dialogue and q s line of reasoning  sorry not sorry but i dislike  de aging  it never looks good 
0,yeah  i wish the relationship with troi came off a bit more natural  oftnetimes it was a bit unclear to me if they were together or not that being said  really would love to see a polyamorous group of crewmembers on screen  phlox was nice but except for an episode where it mostly served to fluster trip  we never had such a thing in the maincast 
0,you ain t seen nothin yet
0,you are not authorized to give commands from your present location 
0,i always liked ent despite its many flaws  i liked that the characters weren t very far  from contemporary humans  so they seemed pretty relatable   i wasn t all that into the temporal cold war stuff or the xindi arc  but the basic premise was as  boldly go  as any of the other series but then again i also like dsc and pic even though i have some major criticisms of each 
0,measure of a man 
0,it s still resurrecting someone with a double mind meld  gaslighting doesn t work on me  try someone else 
0,i think he walks it very realistically 
0,agreed  i just got into star trek this year  starting with star trek  picard  i didn t know who riker was when we saw him on nepenthe but he immediately became my favorite character and is what made me want to watch tng 
0,i hope it s named after crazy horse the person  i m worried that it might turn out that it is part of the  disgruntled pack animal  class alongside the  uss furious pony   the  uss stubborn mule  and the  uss camel that has had it with you  
0,i would have agreed with you  right up until 21 sept 19 
0,sounds pretty official to me 
0,okay  that is very likely correct  because i ve read the first two typhon pact books  and beverly is still pregnant in those  i guess i ll find the answer to my second question when i finish reading those books 
0,i agree  i was just pointing out there was at least one exception  and kind of a surprising one given it was the midst of the cold war
0,as a kid i didn t get riker  he was my least relatable  least liked tng character  he liked jazz and was always flirting  as an adult close to his age now i really like him more and more 
0,you said it objectively better than i did 
0,check out the episode of  the ready room corresponding to s3e11   su kal    they go into the makeup in quite some detail 
0,fair enough  there are some errors in discovery  but i think the pros out weigh them  for instance pike getting a chance to be a real character was great  and adds to the experience of watching original series 
0,  will admitting his father hurt him with his abandonment etc and dr  pulaski being like oh well i think he s hot he had good reasons  it took him a lot to admit that  sealed the deal will is cool and pulaski is not 
0,ok i mean i prefer ent over discovery any day the latter is better produced but the former has better stories and characters 
0,there are other parts that weren t part of that   in tos  the federation didn t know about practical cloaking technology until the balance of terror and the klingons certainly didn t have it until the movies if iirc   so everything that happens in the klingon war doesn t jive with tos   of course  ent also had cloaks  except the suliban designs and those of the romulan minefield were masked by particles and not light bending and they could be countered  so the tech encountered later could be a completely distinct tech   regardless  why could the federation be surprised about the romulan bird of prey when then had encountered the sarcophagus and the cleave ship and all the other klingon ships that were equipped with cloaks 
0,i don t think it has  it s still exactly what it always has been 
0,imagine a  year of hell  style episode about that particular riker and his enterprise  man  that woulda been cool 
0,it looked like he knew he d never truly be able to forgive himself for it 
0,there are some things that are objectively better than other things  regardless of subjective opinions  it s popular to say all value judgements are merely subjective  but not correct  taste is generally subjective  whereas things can have a varying degree of objective quality there s nothing wrong with having a taste for things that are objectively bad  but saying  good  is always subjective is incorrect because there are some values which are held universally  a thing can be of good or bad quality despite subjective perceptions of it 
0,i disagree  and i think treating media as wholly subjective is how we get things like taste politics  we may also disagree on how to indicate or measure  goodness   but that doesn t make it subjective  it s still based on a systematic analysis that doesn t include subjective enjoyment we need to be able to talk about media and creative endeavors in ways that enable us to explore them and their themes without getting tangled up in the emotional attachment to things when we decouple subjective enjoyment from assessment of quality  we remove the power of people that say things like  if you like  x  then you are dumb   that may sound like an extreme example  but it is how western society  broadly  talks about media or art  no one has the authority to tell you or anyone else what is good to enjoy  so long as we aren t talking about things that hurt other people  
0,that s not the same thing as a holographic drone 
0, gt  competence porni see this mentioned as a criticism sometimes  but yeah  that s exactly what i want   real life has plenty of tragically flawed characters making bad decisions  thank you very much 
0,  
0,apart from some basic issues  such as a really bland cast of characters and an arc that was really not thought out when it needed to  for me the  problem  with ent is that it was the first time star trek started worshipping itself  the whole idea behind enterprise is to explore the creation of the federation  the pre kirk era  how it all started  which is a fun idea but it can lead to shows turning inwards  becoming self referential and leaving behind what made the show great to start with  now i don t think enterprise really did this itself  certainly when it changed gear in season 3 it went to new and kinda interesting places  but i do think it started something that lead to the jj abrams movies and later disco and picard that said  i never hated enterprise  it s just weaker than everything that came before it  it still is  a little poorly thought out  a little bland  a  horrendous  finale  obviously  better than disco and picard though 
0,been watching it for the first time and i like it a lot  i agree that taste doesn t necessarily indicate quality ent doesn t have a great deal of philosophical depth  which seems to be an objective marker for a lack of quality  especially for star trek  it also has a limited set of characters some of whom are really quite mundane  but i d argue it does have some strength in plot and a couple of strong characters  namely archer  t pol  tucker and phlox  oh and porthos  of course the thing i like most about ent is that it does a good job of depicting starfleet in its adolescence  the combination of exploration and flailing about in uncertainty strikes a chord with the way humans behave in new situations i think  taste aside  it is arguable that ent hits on some objective aspect of human experience  dressing it up in reasonable plots  that doesn t appeal to all trek fans 
0,ent has always been good 
0,enterprise as a ship name has a long history before being used on the aircraft carrier u s s  enterprise  cv 6 and cvn 65 
0,he always seems like a dick when interacting with the non bridge crew  there s being an authority  and there s being a dick  and i don t think he walks that line well
0,yeah  the previous hosts seem to be able to assert themselves over the symbiont to some degree when the want to  this is evinced by both jadzia and ezri allowing their memories of former loved ones to cloud their own feelings  the dude who was studying the symbiont mud on trill said one of the hosts wasn t playing fair in regards to the problem with joran  so it seems like previous hosts can conceal things or bring things to the forefront if they want to 
0,she might be the head of the fenris rangers
0, pinocchio is broken  its strings have been cut    he delivers this line in such a devastating way 
0,instead of people loving it for what it is  not for what they want it to be  it seems like you want people to form opinions about it based on what  you  think it is   good  is subjective 
0,interesting points how has ent been  worsened  by new trek 
0,that s how i see it  dax itself is the organizer of the memories  maybe dax was like   yeeeeaaaah  she doesn t need to know that  that s weird  
0,aren t the androids human  i mean it would be easy to tell they aren t human and be easy to find 
0,this post is now making me rethink the episode haha  i m gonna have to go back and watch it now  i just remember being annoyed  i felt like they were just shoving in familiar characters out of nowhere  but i ll give it a second chance   
0,she will probably be an alcoholic
0, gt  but if the enterprise had been better armed and immediately destroyed the romulan ship there would have been no federation casualties cold comfort for the population of outpost 4 seriously  you have such a superficial understanding of that story  i m honestly shocked how much you have completely missed the point  the entire plot is arguing  against  your interpretation  it s saying in pretty stark terms that your thinking is wrong  you don t have to agree with it  of course  but the episode does not support your view 
0,tasha would like to have a word with you 
0, gt  there are no  hologram borg  as they re completely pointless they do use hologram technology though   we see it specifically in unimatrix zero where an assimilated janeway is recreated as her pre borg appearance to have a conversation with the queen  amp  to project a hologram of herself to voyagers sickbay 
0,has whining and telling people to shut up ever resulted in the outcome you expected   just curious 
0,nx class  not even close  it s a fantastic starfleet design that also looks compatible with real world space technology   enterprise  had the best aesthetic of all the star trek series  imo runner up would probably be the  intrepid   class  which looks sexy and functional at the same time  after that is the connie refit  because it looks like a tall ship 
0, shippy mc ship face  was taken
0,i respectfully disagree with you and am not alone in feeling this way  i still want to know where these numbers come from  is it certain critics or is it just user submitted 
0,  
0,as long as we also get a series set in 1960 s las vegas starring nog and vic fontaine 
0,ds9 was by no means a bad show  it was great and i enjoyed watching it but somehow   i wished there had been a little more sci fi stuff  it was mostly only about the characters   which were great  don t cancel me   but it didn t offer that much more   still  it s a funny as hell idea          gt because of how compelling their characters were on ds9  i would watch a sitcom where garak foils kai winn s plans each episode  maybe a dark miniseries as well 
0,his look of utter disdain and resignation when he turns off data   
0,that and in lower decks when  gt  he shows up with the titan  lt   i literally jumped up and shouted with joy 
0,like you i returned to std after giving up on that mess just to find almost every episode revolving around a crying burnham   if people like this  that s fine  i just can t get into it    amp  x200b also couldn t get into picard  i don t recognize who picard is in the show anymore  it didn t feel like a the natural progression of that character  the federation or anything in general   to each their own though 
0,personally  i feel like it gets just about the right amount of appreciation  they do a better job at character development and just having better actors than voyager  but overall i wish they did more with characters like t pol or travis  in my mind  this doesnt stand up when compared to tng or ds9 where so many minor characters were so fleshed out  barkley  quark  etc  just like all trek there are some pretty cringe but entertaining episodes  overall  i think enterprise and voyager suffer from amazing premise and not quite nailing the execution  that being said  i m rewatching ent right now for the first time in a long time  so maybe it will change my mind on rewatch 
0,how about star trek  mundane worlds   captain gordon ramsey  first officer tammy duckworth  chief science officer neil de grasse tyson  chief of security bruce schneier  chief medical officer doctor elvis  chief engineer jamie hyneman
0,hopefully they will hire some good writers for an episode or two this season   
0,i agree the first couple of seasons it spent too much time being  the prequel  if you get what i mean  by mid season 3 season 4 they had a clear purpose and i think that helped the show a lot  i can only imagine it getting better if they d been allowed to continue  mid season 5  the first  federation  issue involving them all  humans  vulcans  andorians  telerites    there were a good couple of seasons left in that show i think
0,that might be part of it  part according to this  interview     he did because nobody was going to stop him  and then i thought  this is really a hotdog     hole thing to do  nobody s going to let me do this  and then nobody stopped me  it s such a cocky  unattractive  kind of bad cowboy move  
0,about half of those are just words with an appropriate meaning regardless  particularly intrepid or defiant 
0,i think they d have to ditch more than the focus on burnham s personal life for me to find it enjoyable   the special effects are fantastic  i ll give it that 
0,dis ive found really enjoyable  if they ditched the focus on michaels personal life it would be better tho lol
0,i know that it s already  the episode where it gets good   but god damn everything about riker s character in the measure of a man is amazing  especially in that end scene where data visits him in his room 
0,the fact that creating a new navigator seems extremely hard  perhaps impossible without a live tardigrade   and the crew discovered dilithium planet   and  they made a good impression with the ni varans whilst proving sb 19 didn t cause the burn  all leads me to suspect the spore drive won t ever be replicated  my theory at the moment is that we ll see a rebirth of the federation with rationed  but not scarce  dilithium for short range travel and gateways for long distance  discovery can remain unique this would avoid a real headache for the writers of trying to come up with good story lines that work when everyone has instant travel anywhere 
0,i had mixed feelings about ent when it originally aired  but over time i grew to truly love it   it isn t perfect at all  and there are some truly bad episodes  but i think it s aging far better than std or pic ever will   who knows though  maybe i m wrong 
0,agreed  i think joachim would have been the best choice and they would have to change the whole kirk in the reactor spock yelling khaaaan thing  that really is the most painful part of the film 
0,which is actually because frakes has back issues but let s pretend we don t know that 
0,indiana song 
0,yeah  and that was bullshit to but at least kirk was actually kinda good at his job  lack of experience non withstanding 
0,yeah and she had recently said on the david tennant podcast that she wished she d been invited
0,that s one of the best videos ever   this one   at half speed however  made me cry i was laughing so much  dooo youuuuu belieeeeve in the poooooowerrrrr of a currrrrrrrrsse 
0,i disagree burnham does shit but she isn t the center  she didn t find the source of the burn stamets and adira do  she didn t cause the burn  that was a kelpian child  she didn t negotiate with the chain that was admiral vance  she didn t free discoveries bridge crew  that was the crew themselves  she also probably won t save the kelpian  child  because saru will do that  the only major thing she has done this season is negotiate with the vulcans and romulans for data they had related to the burn  she is also a fitting person to do that since she is spock s sister  i understand being frustrated with burnham but just because she does stuff doesn t mean that she is the center of the universe this season

0,i know star trek picard is controversial around here  but  gt  fleet admiral riker leading the federation armada to save the day at the end  lt  is one of my favorite moments in all of star trek  i m a 38 year old man and it made me cry 
0,i actually don t like it  although it looks  futuristic  it gives me a sense of lazy writing  that ship can never fit between the debris   nah  we will just change its shape if we have to  
0,rewatching tng as an adult really cemented how great riker is  i didn t really gravitate to him as a kid  but as i got older i really appreciated how he always seems to be having a great time and so much credit goes to jonathan frakes  riker s character doesn t have the immediate hook as word or data  but he still has personality  i also appreciate that the writers didn t try to wring too much drama out of riker and troi  they were fine with each other having other romantic partners  there was no jealousy  i always thought that was a smart choice coming out of rodenberry s secular humanistic utopian ideals 
0,  
0,actually no  strategically it was the worst  if you can jump a ship controlled by the enemy away  do it  otherwise there might not be a starfleet hq there for long 
0,i think he s a really fun character  i like how he s a real alpha male  leading man type in the mould of kirk  but also really open minded in surprising ways 
0,that was so chilling when i was a kid  the statement itself  and the desperation behind it 
0,but also damn you  enterprise was one of my favourites haha  mainly for dr phlox 
0,i just wondered why they needed a face to face meeting if they apparently can holo communicate everywhere 
0, computer  run barclay calisthenics program 3  
0,same  although i technically started with one of the abrams movies  then went back and religiously watched all of it  it s all great  a vibrant lively universe full of adventure  what s not to love
0,zulu was shown to have a boyfriend or husband in star trek beyond 
0,haha i don t know about that  i started with tos and love all of them  except enterprise lol 
0,burnham has learned that she can t control everything and that sometimes sacrificing what is important to her in order to help the federation is important  stamets has learned how to relate to others better  how to surrender control  his relationship with hugh   and now he is having paternal feelings towards adira which is something the old stamets wouldn t do 
0,because star trek fans hate any sort of trek that isn t the first one they watched
0,seemed like a bit of both to me   sisko wanted to believe nog  but based on past experience  and the fact that nog wasn t being completely honest  it seemed like some elaborate trick   rejecting the application forced nog to be truthful  instead of saying what he thought sisko wanted to hear 
0,how annoying would it be if every time you said  computer  arch   an arch appeared for you to walk out of  and you turned out to simple be in an endless nest of holodeck programs 
0, the north star  is the episode in s3  shows how little ppl watched the ent series that it s got episodes totally forgotten by fans 
0,i had a thought a few days ago regarding this what if the reason why there was no mirror episodes of tng was because q kept them from it  kind of like how admiral cornwell kept pike and the enterprise away during the klingon war  because they were the best of starfleet humanity and q had other motives for them  specifically the events of all good things   if the crew were introduced to the mirror universe they might have changed their perspectives and become darker and q didn t want that to happen to his pet project just a thought  obviously that is not the reason  it it s fun 
0,there is a ship controlled by enemy forces within the defence perimeter of starfleet hq  if they have a chance to jump away  not doing it is the worst decision   
0,my favorite series  so much untapped potential  seasons 5 7 would have been great 
0,i will always love hims for  admiral face kick  they should use this to test against alien infiltration  just have admirals line up every so often  have riker kick them in the face and then see if they drop 
0,ya i agree  tho classifying it kind of makes sense for how dis adventures are irrelevant to tos  and dis  interaction between spock and the telosians for me makes the spock court martial episode make even more sense bc it shows he was in contact with the telosians between the events of the cage and him attempting to return pike to telos iv  but the size of the battle at the end of s2 makes it seem impossible that star fleet crews wouldn t know of what happened  also the klingons helping seems odd because within ten years they re bitter enemies again and not friendly until the khitomer accords 
0,it was announced last year after the second season of discovery  the idea is that the same cast that played captain pike s crew in discovery would be taking on the reboot  the announcement made it seem like it was a ways away  though edit  i misspoke  it s not a tos reboot  but a series that takes place aboard the enterprise a  decade prior to tos 
0,we re not in a simulation  moriarty told me so 
0,there s actually a rational explanation for why he sits that way its to keep his legs limber incase he needs to  kick an admiral in the face  you never know when the need will arise 
0,neelix is the best chef bartender out of all the series
0,the hero we deserve    
0, get nothing   gets everything  is 100  bs maybe you can rewatch the episode and pay more attention to the dialogues federation cannot replicate spore drive  chain can  and discovery is under chain s control  everyone is running out of dilithium  not only chainand the rest is just your imagination playing discovery also has nothing to do with gene s vision since the beginning
0, gt  just look at star trek 2009 and kirk s rise from a nobody to captain of the federations flag ship which also felt forced  however as it was kirk  on the enterprise  it was much easier to get away with  their kirk also showed leadership star trek has also equally shown that command rank is a long path to get to  which requires dedication and hard work  such as in thine own self where troy had to take the bridge officer s test star trek has also shown that being second in command comes with a long list of management which an ensign will have no experience in  crew evaluations  organising shift rotations  disciplining crew memebers  training crew members  running training exercises  all things riker did in tng  kira did similar stuff in ds9  making stamets or hugh second in command would make more sense  because at least they ve done management tilly is an ensign  it s just a dumb plotline 
0,i m just going to start randomly doing that at work lol  my luck i would mess up and look stupid lol
0,that was the height of star trek 
0,which is fair  i just wonder if there s a bit much trek to go around atm 
0,where do you see  meaning  in there hugh died to prove that some lesser antagonist bitch is a bitch  that s it  as if we hadn t known before and i say  lesser  because you know  given the price we as viewers paid for her  hugh s death   narissa could have become a villain we love to hate  she was ruthless  badass  and had    interesting    chemistry with her brother  they could at least let her survive the season to return another day  instead  they kill  her  off just  a few episodes later  what a fucking waste 
0,don t forget  he gave us the greatest  maneuver   ever seen in star trek lore 
0,the federation has the spore drive and with that they can start to rebuild society  they literally get nothing from siding with the chain and osyraa gets everything she needs to hold onto power  the federation knows the chain is running out of dilithium  once it runs out of dilithium it will fall apart and the people the chain oppresses will be free  the federation siding with the chain just keeps them in power longer the chain may be willing to give up slavery but you know they won t give their free slaves any rights  it would be like the united states where we abolished slavery and then many of the former slaves just continued to work for their masters because they had no other choice  hell even none slaves have a shitty time in the emerald chain  just look at the emerald chain scientist who would have been left to die had he not been useful you also have the out of universe explanation for why this couldn t work  the federation accepting capitalism would spit on rodenberry s vision and legacy  a capitalist federation is not the federation 
0,also record was right  it does take time to staff 4 shitfs versus 3  more time than they had
0,it s definitely underrated   personally  i think that ds9 and ent do more to establish a cohesive trek universe than tos  tas  tng  voy  disco  and pic combined   this is mostly because those two shows were forced to show the consequences of the actions of their respective crews while the other shows kinda flit around   disco is an exception to this  as you do see the consequences of the crew s actions  but the first and second season never felt like anything mattered  hey guess what  tos takes place in less than a decade and none of this is referenced  why should i care 
0,picard   great  lower decks   good  discovery   good
0,i respectfully disagree  i find the third season of discovery to be excruciatingly painful to watch due to the writing  i m not alone in feeling this way 
0,tbh i d take it instead of discovery
0,probably yeah  in that it really was a good series and a solid change of pace   it made some mistakes  but it feels like the forgotten series to me sort of   especially around non fansi liked the minimalist style of the ship
0,aren t they already running like three st shows at once rn   
0,the federation is gone  the borg are everywhere
0,definitely 
0,i agree  my point is a lot of the  not my star trek  crowd look at trek through very rose colored glasses and are remembering more nostalgia than the mistakes that old trek actually made 
0,i feel old
0,she probably wouldn t be an ensign had she stayed in the correct time and was promoted for all the shit she does in season 1 and 2  also trek has promoted ensigns all the way up to captain  just look at star trek 2009 and kirk s rise from a nobody to captain of the federations flag ship 
0,that intro sold me man  just perfect
0,nog took a greater risk than any ferengi entrepreneur  in my opinion 
0,the point is that they are interesting episodes that build the universe and characters  one thing i hate about modern tv is that everything has to always move the main plot forward  it s tv not a movie so they can go on side tangents  also people s main complaint with discovery is that they don t develope characters so detmer s ptsd was to provide her character more development  in addition her ptsd helped address a common star trek issue  the character go through hell and back in some episodes and then they are perfectly fine the next  just look at how much shit picard is put through in tng but he is always fine the next episode 
0,the handful of tas episodes i ve watched have been pretty good  though the animation style is rough   like a jr intern at hanna barbera did it alone
0, parallels  riker is my favorite with his pandemic beard and crazed look screaming he doesn t want to go back to his dimension because it s overrun by the borg 
0,me too  its unique  and as soon as it starts i get chills in my spine in anticipation  i rewatch it on netflix
0,which is also the point i was trying to make earlier  picard gave raffi  jurati  soji  seven  elnor their own plot lines and it was a muddy mess 
0,yes  its been a long road  getting from there  jan 2020  to here  jan 2021     prophetic
0,got a source for that 
0,the crew probably loves him because he stood up against jellico s four shift rotation
0,what would that entail  restoring the damage to his parietal lobe  his artificial heart  old scars  and any leftover borg implants seems like the only difference between the two bodies  jurati and soong told him he didn t have any superpowers  and that he had a normal lifespan i think the story will leverage this in a  what s  the difference   kind if way  what would be excellent in my opinion is a scenario where q tells picard that he still is human  that he and others like him are hardly different from  normal  humans  spock got inserted into a body which was produced through man made means too after all edit  if that sounded confrontational  that s my failure to communicate  i bet you have really cool ideas for how this interaction would work  and what it would entail 
0,yeah but that was a different time  things have progressed 
0,cbs  fuck around and find out
0,  
0,they could  garak  rom  nog  dukat  even morn were all supporting actors and got their own stories 
0,i ll agree  but also that it s not out of character for star trek  kirk always saves the day but also sometimes with a little help from spock 
0,    kay edit  i mean clearly a lot of people would since picard got ac second season  but    i don t get it 
0,ah i missed that thank you 
0,yeah i really miss  nothing has happened  parts   just all the in between stuff imagining what day to day life would be like living on a starship exploring the future in space  sometimes it s mundane  but it was always better than the here and now 
0, gt retardedabsolutely not allowed here  only warning 
0,the fact that we see three instances of whale call in the show  earth whales  probe whales  xindi  is interesting  it suggests that this kind of communication is relatively common among moderately intelligent aquatic marine species throughout the galaxy  i don t think the xindi sent the probe but it is an interesting thing to think about 
0,i honestly think the only way that may have made sense would be a mind meld between prime spock and not only pike but the c in c of starfleet  to fill them in on kirk s potential 
0,  
0,i like the stories  plot  and characters of season 3  it s nice that trek is actually exploring something new instead of doing shit in the same old time periods  rebuilding the federation and the state of the galaxy post burn is extremely interesting 
0,  
0,nailed it 
0,yes  but the vast majority of ships in tos were named after british and american warships   excalibur  was named after a british submarine   exeter  was named after a british warship sunk in battle in 1942  the  hood  was named after a british battle cruiser sunk by the german battleship  bismarck   the  defiant  was named after a film about a mutiny on a british ship  the starships  intrepid    yorktown    lexington    constellation   and  enterprise  were all named after american aircraft carriers meanwhile  in the later tos movies  as well as all star trek shows that came along  there is a diversity of names  from the native american names like the  lakota  we discussed to the names of writers and composers like  prokofiev  and  tolstoy  
0,i always got excited when he a bashir were on screen together  never a bad scene imo 
0,i think season 3 is much better than the red angel arc  michael is still the main character  that s just the nature of the show  but she isn t the center of the universe like the red angel arc makes her 
0,what meaning does any of it have though  detmer s apparent ptsd and overcoming it  adira s invisible friend and all that trill knowledge  the presence of georgiou and the guardian of forever  all of these elements could be  and nothing would change  it s like a repeated violation of the chekhov s gun principle i m not sure if they re going for a kind of best of both worlds approach combining season long plots with episodic stories  but to me it seems like empty filler  they ve added these side quests but don t have the time to linger on any of their consequences  which paradoxically leads to it feeling like the side quests were a waste of time and completely inconsequential  in which case don t bother with them 
0, gt since for some reason they don t seem to have any interest in replicating the spore drive they explained this last episode  the federation  as is  is unable to replicate the spore drive  this is part of osyraa s pitch to get vance to ally the federation and the chain  since the chain has the most well funded scientific institutions in the galaxy right now no one has found another tardigrade  and the tardigrade dna that fused with stamets  dna is unable to be duplicated via normal means for insertion into other people 
0,well  no  michael chabon is an executive producer on the second season instead of showrunner  it s a bit of a shame since he has written good stuff before picard  i just think he hadn t figured out how to write and act as showrunner for a tv show yet 
0, evil alternate universe is just cliche   south park s evil alternate universe was funny because cartman was so nice  and the stargate atlantis evil alternate universe was ok  but to develope an entire series around it  no thank you 
0,how do they come up with these ratings  season 3 of discovery is the best one by far and is the best thing trek has put out since deep space nine  is it as good as ds9  no but it is better than voyager or enterprise 
0,even though i like the kelvin films for the most part   into darkness  shit the bed in using khan  before it came out that the villain was whitewashed khan  i had the theory that he was gary mitchell  if they were going to bring back a tos big bad  mitchell would ve been less obvious  more interesting  and would ve eliminated the pointless wok references  his powers could also have made possible a lot of plot movement without going so far off the rail with technological continuity 
0,the course the prophets choose for us may not always be comfortable  but we must follow it 
0,yeah  was fun for a little bit but i skip the mirror universe episodes on a re watch  i kinda feel it s more for the actors than for the rest of us 
0,well that image is a trip down memory lanehow the hell was that 25 years ago
0,i thought so too  but it really grew on me 
0,tbh  at first i was very annoyed as i was accustomed to the usual intros but it really grew on me and now i really vibe with the song whenever i hear it 
0,todd haberkorn  because he did his best to be true to nimoy s spock in a fantastic fan creation 
0,i would 100  watch that
0,she is an ensign frankly i m surprised a third of the crew isn t pissed off that an ensign who was below them in rank  has been promoted to become their superior 
0,hmm  ok  that must have escaped me    
0,i m watching it as i m writing this and i do not see what s so good about it  however i think it s better than voyager
0,i think this season set vance up as a badmiral so to speak  by making him suspicious about the crew and initially deny the discovery its autonomy but that was a red herring  he s a reasonable person and tries to make the right choices  of course we trust these characters  as we know them  he has no reason to however 
0,agreed
0,it s a great series it s nice seeing this universe in one of it s earlier stages and all this stuff is new to these characters it gives them all fresh eyes to look through
0,yes  ds9 just had one banger after another  duet still makes me teary eyed  whenever i re watch it 
0,she was literally put in the command training program last season  they were building up to this 
0,oh dear god
0,riker is my favorite tng character 
0,so like kirk in the 2009 star trek movie 
0,she is more than just a name she is also one of the better developed discovery characters although that isn t saying much  she was on the command track last season so they literally were building towards this  i agree it doesn t make a lot of sense at least when it comes to rank but it s hard to say the character didn t earn it 
0,that s a good point  hopefully it s brought up in the finale  could be a seed planted so that once they prove the burn wasn t caused by the experiment  they can use that form of travel going forward  since for some reason they don t seem to have any interest in replicating the spore drive 
0,you re thinking of doctor who you sfs 
0, gt  unashamedly lying it s the real  prime timeline star trekdiscovery and picard are prime timeline 
0,don t forget the hissing 
0,the worst part is that they are not even rushed for time   it isn t like each episode is a solidly built story with strong character development   so much of picard  and discovery  is just pointless mcguffin finding   you gotta go to location a to get a mcguffin so that you can go to location b and do a thing   that would be fine id the mcguffin chasing was interesting or character building  but it isn t   discovery is the worst offender of this   if you cut out all of the mcguffin finding techno babble  the monologues  the endless goodbye and funeral scenes  and swelling music scenes where they are looking at each other and reaffirming that they are both starfleet and family  you d have 50  more show time to work with they are not running out of time  they are just telling a bad   the story in discovery and picard were both awful   it s really unfortunate  because you can see places where they  could  tell an interesting story in the settings they have chosen   but no  both picard and discovery have to save the fucking galaxy   q forbid they have a plot that doesn t revolve around the fate of the galaxy    again 
0,  
0,when the previous daxes were  from the symbiont  jadzia didn t have their memories  so  it s logical to assume that she wouldn t remember those particular details about curzon anyway  since she didn t have his memories at the time 
0,side plot  rumors will start to fly about how unlucky her acolytes are  and new recruits pray they get assigned to different vedeks  and not her 
0,headcanon accepted  awesome idea 
0,well  by the time you get to the first episode of season 2  they d already made 26 episodes   and i disagree  i don t think we knew that much about the bridge crew yet   we knew picard hated kids  that will and deanna had a thing  that troi can sense things and that she had ample cleavage  worf is angry  and data is an android with a patrick bateman brother 
0,i d love that  but it s also possible he only meant he d show up again on lower decks  i m not ruling anything out  i just don t want to get myself too hyped for a live action appearance from him until we know more
0,yeah   i really don t want to make this point because it makes me sound salty  but there s an obvious difference between a one episode cameo every couple of years and  say  as a totally random example  adding two   members of the original series to your cast for an entire season 
0,hardly fairhaven though is it    why is someone running this dystopian mess 
0,they didn t develop his character   stp had no almost no character development   they briefly gave a vague sketch of what huge might have been doing  and then killed him   they gave seven a freaking borg cube  used it to get the location they needed her at  and then trashed it   they briefly introduced us to riker again and showed us that he was boring  and then had him be the deus ex machina to show up with the a massive copy and paste fleet to take on then almost equally massive copy and paste fleet from the romulan super secret organization i m totally cool with killing off named characters  just make it worthwhile   introducing a character to just pointlessly kill them is boring and stupid anti fan service stp would have been so much better if they had completely trashed the android plot  and simply built the story around seven and what she was doing   imagine if stp has been about the when seven and picard stealing that borg cube for  insert reason here   becoming fugitives across all known space  and then the story was about them doing stuff in and around the shattered romulan empire but nah  kill hugh  trash a borg cube  make picard an old man android that will die  introduce some robot cthulhu who is beaten back by the androids promising not to summon it again   copy and paste riker s ship to save the damn 
0,i mean  as far as i know  the only  official  deck plans are for the  enterprise d   so anything you get is going to be a fan version   at least for  intrepid  class  isn t  this   basically what you re looking for    seconding u poirotoro for the blueprints database  
0,certain sections of the fanbase have a very hard time accepting that star trek may not always be presented in the exact way that they prefer  it s often the same people that shit on dsc  pic  and lds  to be fair  the continuity left a lot to be desired  and  into darkness  could ve been much better without much extra effort  unfortunately  that s also the most successful of the new trilogy   beyond  may have hewed the most closely to the original concept of trek  but it was also a financial failure 
0,i may have missed something but 1  why are any of the crew alive 2  is the best we can do in the future opening airlocks to put out fires 3  why did she grab michael by her shoes   how does that ever go well 4  why did michael do some crazy martial arts rather than use her phaser 5  why did discovery have to be hijacked if all they wanted was to talk about peaceful negotiations  it feels the chain want about this the absolutely worst way possible  in fact why are they even negotiating  isn t the federation basically over 6  why is michael so desperate to get stamets off the ship  i mean he was right  why don t they just teleport to the nebula and get their friends back  it would take literally 20 seconds 7  how does the technology work  was there a line i missed about turning off site to site transport and all communication  as they knew where michael was in the jeffries tubes why didnt they just transport her to whether ever they wanted  why didn t michael try and warn the federation that the chain were going to blown them all up like book said they had done before  8  why can t the discovery teleporting be replicated  how did stamets know the tartagrade was extinct  they have literally just arrived in the future  and it seems no one has even mentioned trying to copy it  which apparently can be done as its the entire point of this negotiation  so does the chain have the technology to replicate it or not 
0,hopefully she will repeat her act from yesterdays enterprise telling them this is wrong and its not supposed to be this way 
0, gt  star trek moved beyond the names of american and british warships long ago  and we re better for ittos did have the uss potemkin
0,i have watched it just now because of your comment  i think i ve always skipped it based on the blurb   intense dreams  yeah yeah  but it was indeed pretty   good   powerful 
0,their page for the  ent d   are scans of a set of actual blueprints from a book that was sold  they cover the entire interior of the galaxy class  and i don t think it s a stretch to say other ships of that era look pretty much the same  just with different overall exterior shapes 
0,i was going to argue  because yesterday s enterprise did not resemble the mirror uni we are used to seeing   but it was indeed an alternate universe   so while technically correct  yes  the best kind   it was not a true mirror uni where good is bad and up is down and right is wrong 
0,honestly  into darkness would have been a lot better if the big twist was that harrison was joachim or one of the other augments  and he was bargaining for khan s life  maybe show a cgi montalban face in the one of the cryogenic tubes  
0,this    thank you 
0,til  i had no idea that phrase was used outside of star trek  that s badass 
0,noooooooo   leave guinean alone 
0,this is the best idea for a new show i ve ever seen 
0,they were the ones almost wiped out by their former subjects and left in cryo stasis  that name sounds right
0,have you seen discovery season 3  it s not as episodic as older shows but the episodes definitely stand on their own more than last seasons  honestly you won t see a show like tng again because television is a different beast now  there are already lots of people complaining that discovery spends too much time on side episodes and not enough on the  main plot  
0,no  voyager is  temporal war never went anywhere and the xindi war was a hackneyed 9 11 allegory  it got better in season 4 but it should have been that from day 1 
0,my child  i know you still hold me responsible for the deplorable attempt on vedek bareil s life  but i can only pray that someday you will be cured of this unfortunate misconception 
0,well  in universe  so to speak   the empire had fallen and terran were a conquered  despised slave race of course  this hadn t been established yet  but i think it s a more interesting turn of events than a straightforward mirror universe tng episode might have been 
0,i really hope not   i really have never liked her or her episodes 
0,worf doesn t actually embody the atypically klingon  he doesn t believe that  but that phrase has been uttered by other klingons  dax makes it clear  klingon honor is bullshit  and is really more of an idea 
0,having both would have made even more sense  tng had a bad habit of having admirals command their own ships  when most likely they d keep it like in the real world    the captain commands  while the admiral focuses on the overall fleet ignoring the unrealistic part of riker being reactivated just because he asked and giving him command of the lead ship of that fleet  it would have made sense if riker showed up with the admiral standing behind him  and both got to have a say 
0,a sitcom where garak foils the kai s plans each time  but she thinks she s surrounded by incompetent acolytes  not realizing it s him 
0,cats starring the image of tasha yarr  ran by data 
0,i ll through my missus under the bus  she thought it was named after the osmonds song  i wondered why she chuckled when it was mentioned 
0,i love the slower pace of discovery season 3  the burn is a background plot and not the main plot  it s important but it s also important for discovery to find her place in the galaxy  the latest episodes of discovery have in particular been really good  i also liked the weird trill shit with adira  it felt like classic trek 
0,even if not technically    the    mirror universe   yesterday s enterprise  and voy s  living witness  essentially function as each series respective mirror episode 
0,yeah unfortunately  didn t have what i was looking for
0,they would be the actors who would elevate the tropes  make them their own 
0,have you tried the  star trek blueprints database   it s the most complete collection i know of online  keep in mind the majority are fan creations  the shows have no need to make any for production purposes  although some plans are  officially licensed   also keep in mind that  because  they are mostly fan creations  some are only shown at sample size  you have to pay the creator for the full size versions 
0,the prime directive evolved in the later on series because the time periods the shows were produced in  the 60 s was a time of rebellion so of course the prime directive was treated as an authority to that could be subverted  in the late 80 s when they were writing tng the prime directive had evolved into a constitution type of work were it was the legal framework that the starfleet officers followed in there duties to achieve there missions  but kirk never violated the prime directive because he did what he wanted  only as a last resort because the alternative was far worse  or in some situations because there was an unforeseen accident 
0,heres the  video  
0,garak is the best ds9 episode  there is not a single bad garak episode and the ones he is in are among the best in the show  both the writers and the actor really nailed the character 
0,what we think is irrelevant  it wasn t shown the way you described  but what happened   she said that she is there on behalf of the chain and that chain has it s own governance  the method of enforcement is exactly the same as with any other treaties  if other party is not following the agreed terms  treaty is over and what is the alternative for federation  it s not like they are prospering or have any positive future for them
0,haha  thank you   i think the major difference for me is that my understanding of trek is quite limited compared to everyone else  i might honestly be so invested in discovery because of how new it is to me  not everything has been a hit with me  like the explanation of the burn  but it has been enjoyable to me personally as a whole  i understand my views might be quite unique and uncommon  but hey  at least i m enjoying it  unlike voyager      i do remember that when i told my two friends who recommended ds9 to me about my opinion both of them practically shouted  what    in unison xd
0,i ll get you next time garek  go go garek sewing machine 
0,the chain is on the brink of collapse  the fact that they are even considering joining the federation is proof of that  i think it s wiser for the federation to let the chain collapse and then if able provide humanitarian relief  if slavery is abolished it won t change their economy over night  just look at what happened when the united states abolished slavery 
0,fanbase  where is saru  is he all right disco writers  it seems  for no reason  we killed him fanbase    mass unsubscribe   cbs  resubscribe for picard  or we ll write off your favorite characters one by one fanbase    goes insane

0,you might be right 
0,and in voyager they found tashs catapult the power core of the catapult generated a massive graviton surge that locked onto a ship through an array of projectors  the surge sent the ship hurtling into null space for some hours  upon emerging back to normal space  the vessel had jumped many hundreds or even thousands of light years  the distance was determined by the graviton field strength their crew had built such a device as a means of getting home in a shorter period of time than by warp drive  the first test had destabilized the tetryon reactions of the tetryon reactor used as the power core  causing it to leak bursts of epsilon radiation  voyager used graviton pulses fired from the deflector dish to stabilize the reactions they got 30 sectors   3 years journey time out out of 1 jump 
0,more than likely  if q shows up in picard  he s just gonna announce the threat macguffin of the season 
0,almost certainly the final episode of picard  and it can be easily explain by q making fun of picards age

0,you d want to see them in a formula style series  like inspector gadget 
0,the way i see it is that while the trill do get the memories of their hosts  they don t get every single memory the host ever had  i don t remember what i had for dinner a week ago  let alone the thousands of hours of my life that are just straight up gone  but we ve all had that moment where a memory we ve not experienced in years comes out of the blue  or is jogged by something i assume the symbionts are like this  they do store all the memories but when you bond those memories are only as accessible as they were for the host  if there s some half forgotten memory tucked away somewhere from a previous life it s no more accessible than something half remembered from your own life 
0,i loved it  not quite sure why  that red goo especially  so many scenes from the superman movies that were amazing  how they got his costume so blue i will never know 
0,i ve seen some of the concept work by discovery s fx3x team for the stargate reboot  it is very much going to do exactly what you claim has  ruined  one of your favourite franchises  as if sgu didn t do that already   
0,what would be the federation a method of enforcing this treaty  osyraa is the leader of her people she isn t a proxy and she wasn t being truthful  i think she was lying the whole time and had trained herself to pass eli  that s why she said she wanted to try again when eli caught her lie about stepping down  she wasn t expecting that question so she hadn t trained her body to look like she wasn t lying 
0, stuffy authority figure wags the directive at kirk and he and his crew boldly defy it to prove how badass they are um     are you entirely sure about this 
0,bryce and rhys are both hot a f   yeah  not a character trait  but i def enjoy their characteristics   rhys enjoys sparring a la mixed martial arts style  your turn 
0,hello  we disagree  that s ok  i understand the kelvin timeline is an alternate reality  it s not one i like  you do  that s ok  we should be able to talk about it and accept one another s point of view i haven t seen the other abrams films because i didn t particularly like the first one  i might watch them one day if i feel like it  i might not  that s also ok 
0,yeah  lower decks is a 45 minute episode jammed into a 22 minute slot certainly wouldn t complain if it was allowed to have longer episodes    glances at the screen  
0,i thought the ds9 episodes were dragged out and dead horse beating levels of bad 
0,the new trek movies aren t really my thing but they are pretty fun  out of the three beyond is my favorite 
0,i d have to concur  i mean  how many of us have seen  any  of tas for that matter  there are folks who genuinely love enterprise  it s final season especially deserves more lover than it does  but i can t recall seeing anyone sing tas s praises 
0,awww you re no fun
0,this episode is a real treat  savor it 
0,that sounds terrible to me 
0,they seem weirdly slow and rushed at the same time  then really rushed when it gets to the finale 
0,oh no    i hadn t even considered that  oh no   thank you   
0,it s a snaake 
0,that was powerful  had mcfadden shook  is there more to that blooper 
0, gt if you think the values aren t applicable then why did you bring them up  lolwhat are you talking about dude  you brought up their conversation in defense of tuvix being murdered  i m saying it isn t applicable lol gt of course they re still alive  that s why i mentioned denying them sleep lol which doesn t work as an analogy  try a different one lol gt i don t think you understand because that s the scenario we have in the episode lol it literally isn t lol gt tuvok and neelix were still dead until janeway brought them back  so until then the emergency was still in full swing lol  plus  that s not a different scenario  that s the same scenario because it s the same emergency as before lol wrong again lol there is no emergency except in your mind  you re making this argument based on the troi riker conversation  that was about choosing between two living people  not choosing to actively murder someone in order to resurrect someone else  lol gt you forgot the other part  whether to murder two innocent people to keep one person alive lol but they weren t being murdered  they were already dead  do you know what the word  murder  means  i don t think you do lol gt nope  it s kill one person or two people  only one philosophy needed because it s one scenario lol  unless you think it s a different scenario because like i said before you seem to think that sleeping people deserve consciousness but you seem to think dead people don t deserve life lol  like i said before lol  why the difference man i don t even know where to start with this  the difference is because sleeping people aren t dead  why do you keep using an analogy that doesn t work lol  and no  it s not actively killing two people  they died in an accident and it s not tuvix s fault   gt you think star trek has always been about killing two people to save one  i don t think you understand star trek lol at this point i think you re just being willfully ignorant or pretending to be retarded to misinterpret what i said this much kek gt two people were dead and would continue to stay dead unless someone did something about it  if that s not an emergency i don t know what is lol  life was about as far from normal as you could get for tuvok and neelix lol  kes and janeway missing their friends is also a symptom of life not being back to normal  even you admit that so you re contradicting yourself on life being normal lol because being dead isn t an emergency  it s what happens after the emergency   gt  you yourself said that  death changes things  again without giving proof lol  where s your proof  you want proof that being dead is different to being asleep  man  gt  i guess you think lyndsay ballard shouldn t have been resurrected because according to you the dead don t deserve life lol  if i had to murder an innocent man to do it  then no she shouldn t be resurrected   gt  i d like to see what you say about resurrecting your friend tuvix after the episode  what excuse you make for going against your argument that the dead should stay dead lol while i wouldn t want tuvix to be murdered in the first place  going ahead and murdering tuvok and neelix in some hypothetical situation to bring tuvix back to life would also be wrong  how are you not understanding this  gt it s not an analogy lol  most people get that stealing is immoral lol  the federation gets it too lol so what s that got to do with the current discussion  lol gt the values are the same about this  the federation thinks stealing is wrong too lol  it s not my opinion  it s a value that lots of people get  including the federation lol okay  whats your point lol gt if it has noting to do with janeway then why did you bring it up lol  you said you would follow a person  picard  rather than what s right  i m showing you why that s a bad philosophy lol i literally didn t say that lol you re running out of arguments again so you re reducing yourself to strawman arguments   gt nope  the core of the debate is whether it s right or not lol  you do get my comment about  the most federation way ever  was a joke and meant that it was the right thing to do  right  because that should have been obvious lol no  it was about it being the most federation way ever  which is why i disputed that it was in line with federation values  come on man  at least stay on topic lol gt you also argue  without proof lol  that federation values are against killing tuvix  an assertion i ve already disproven with the stuff about riker and troi lol lmao you are brain damaged  the riker troi conversation is a situation that is not applicable  so no  you haven t proven anything  but if you want a quote that suits protecting tuvix as  proof   then how about   starfleet was founded to seek out new life  well  there it sits     picard  when defending data s right to exist  that is a more similar comparison to tuvix than the riker troi thing gt wrong on at least two counts lol  i already disproved this idea about my  words   so see above lol  also  a  way  is referring to actions not values lol shifting the goal posts i see  let s face it  you know that what janeway did goes against federation values completely  so now you re trying to say the  federation way  and  federation values  are different  even though your argument with the riker troi convo was to try to state what their values are  but you even got that wrong   i m gonna have to assume at this point you re just trolling or trying to poison the well because you can t admit what janeway did went against everything the federation and starfleet stand for 
0,awesome 
0,this is a bit off topic  but so far i love her depiction of mother abigail in the new stand series 
0,i m a star trek fan since toddlerhood  i love the kelvin movies  they are just behind wrath of khan and voyage home in my book  especially the 1st and 3rd  by the way i m enjoying the new stark trek tv which just confirmed kelvin universe as canon see this  video    notice a few notes from abrams series music in the background  some spoilers for star trek discovery 
0,yes  that s the one 
0,ill agree with that  dis is pretty amazing
0,was until disco 
0,hey google  end program
0,vance made the right decision for the federations ideals  but not for the the millions who will continue to live in slavery because he refused peace 
0,that scene scared the shit out of me as a kid 
0,if the federation let osyra get away with war crimes and also accepted capitalism then they wouldn t be the federation anymore  it would fix things in the short term but i believe the chain would eat the federation from the inside destroying any chance of a true restoration  which would be of a greater benefit to the galaxy  vance made the right decision and has secured himself as one of the best star fleet admirals 
0,sg1  it s good to be king
0,i assume they got to 350 gradually over time  and that the drop to 38 was relatively quick after the burn  but no  nothing official 
0,sorry  i got nerdy and looked at several maps and  the delphic expanse is located well within federation territory  while the probe was first encountered near the neutral zone  while i m sure  near  is a  very  relative term in stellar cartography  it seems unlikely that the probe would have come from xindi space  traveled  away  from earth to be nearer the neutral zone  and then turned around again 
0,i imagine the federation recognizes universal crimes against sentient life  it s like saying the nazis couldn t be tried after world war ii because they did everything under german law and not under the allies jurisdiction  i really liked vance in this episode  he could have accepted peace but if he did so he would be giving up on the federations ideals  what actually makes them the federation and not a collection of starships  if he would have accepted the chain into the fold it would have resulted in the destruction of everything the federation stood for 
0,it s been a long time
0,yaaas
0,except if he were publicly elected then it shouldn t be a secret to osyraa that he s the president
0,true  teleporting from earth to mars in one shot is unbelievable enough  since most treks limited beaming to roughly  orbit   but teleporting from earth to qonos   112 light years away 
0,she confirmed after the producers had already approached her about appearing in the show  patrick asking her was more of a publicity stunt but still a lovely way of making it official 
0,this mirrors the us military naming scheme where every helicopter is named after a native tribe 
0,they are only practicing capitalism because of the burn and the resulting isolation  star trek has always been anti capitalist 
0,being able to teleport between planets
0,no
0,they were able to suppress the memory of an entire host  so hiding that curzon had a crush on jadzia would be easy 
0,ok  now tell me a character trait of bruce  rhys  or nilisson
0,the new movies are a thrill and a great introduction to the show
0,this is going nowhere  blocked 
0,i think the poster is talking about crew development for main cast characters  like    owo  detmer  lt  commander aerium actress  bryce  or    rhys       by s2 of tng  or ds9  or voyager  we had a pretty good idea what the characters were like and their personalities   the most colour we have gotten in bryce and rhys so far are the moments at earths academy and the tapping in the last ep   don t even know their first names   don t get me wrong  everyone is acting their asses off  but my issue with disco has always been pacing and letting things breathe   i don t get the feeling that star trek is a place  though i feel that the most recent episode of disco was the strongest in a while  
0,the chain trades good and services for money and they own lots of capital  she is a capitalist  star trek has always painted capitalists in a bad light  that s why the federation is luxury space communism 
0,your opinions are terrible and you express them in an unpleasant way
0,yeah the whole xindi weapon story in season 3 is basically their war on terror arc 
0,i always found it interesting that betazed was invaded and occupied and we never saw it or really any consequences of that 
0,in what scenario is cheating on a test  within the rules   while it does demonstrate creative thinking  which is a good thing for a cadet  ultimately kirk didn t take the test as intended 
0,i am also not a huge fan of the gods and space magic   but did you hear about that spec script for picard where q transports picard back to 1940s france and he helps the resistance crack a code while dodging nazis   wouldn t that have been a cool episode  while simultaneously being a callback to all the great hokey nazi stuff trek has done in the past i can dream
0,damn  that is the trope they went with in the series  isnt it  during a watch thru of tng  i am always reminded of how psychologically scrambled the bridge crew is from all the anomalies and encounters  makes me feel more for troi and all the batshit crazy things that come her way  how many chocolate sundaes does it take to erase all that baggage dumped on her by her crew 
0,the episodes where pike and georgiou had the a plot were backdoor pilots this just reinforces the idea that secret hideout has a protocol where everything plotwise has to centre on the character at the tip of the call sheet    it s just that pike and georgiou will be at the top of those call sheets for snw and s31 
0,there was a another mission with daniels that went over the fate of it s prime timeline crew  and tasha yar  but its been a while i don t really remember what happened there
0,yes thankfully bigots don t matter 
0,how aggregation of 30 useless opinions is relevant here 
0,doesn t guinan not age  like she looked the same when they were in the 1800 s and on the ship  i guess they can use cgi to de age her but honestly does that ever look good  i didn t think it worked for samual jackson in captian marvel  i guess they can just ignored it all together i hope that this means we do get a scene with him talking to her about now being an android 
0,they go back in time and it really strongly parallels 9 11 and there are nazis winning with the help of aliens  i can never get past that part 
0,i think odo and quark tell each other they love each other by telling each other they hate each other
0,of course not  i wouldn t even know nilsson exists if i wasn t reading reddit discussions all the time but also you seem to argue that characters like dettmer and owo are akin to ensign gates and lt  jae  both of whose main function it was to fill seats so the set doesn t look empty   which is a bit disingenuous  for a start  gates and jae were never part of promotional crew photos such as this one  i agree about o brien  though  who was definitely technically treated as a main character but didn t get much love from the writers in tng  that was partially a sign of the times  of course  both o brien and worf really shone on ds9  and i can only dream of what could have been if other characters such as beverly crusher  deanna troi or geordi la forge had been introduced to ds9 and been given some better quality character development as for discover s bridge crew  they kind of all blend into one generic personality for me  with the exception of dettmer s fleeting moments of  look i have ptsd   in most scenes  you could switch the lines around between owo  nilsson  dettmer  airiam  rip  and the guy whose name i can t remember 
0,yeah before you said it  i was thinking columbo  which had nimoy in it at one point  or like   the star trek equivalent of picket fences
0,yup i think if they were to retcon in why he looks older  that would be it  he did look older in voyager  i took it as hes going through his dad phase of being a q and he wants to look more adult as long as he can still rock a sombrero  im going to be happy 
0,the federation and xindi are on pretty good terms by that point   i d think that they would have had access to databases  etc needed to identify it if that were the case 
0,definitely was picking him up
0,what are you talking about  that never happened on enterprise  the only thing remotely close to that when they went to an alternate world war ii where aliens from the 29th century helped the nazis all of europe  parts of the soviet union  and the eastern united states 
0,and scotty was brought back in relics
0,there s a new tos series reboot   
0,hey man jeffrey colmes is entertaining and i would love to watch the end of enterprise sometime if they ever release the version without scott bakula 
0,love that one  nog is one of the best characters in star trek  period 
0,there s a star trek opera  look up  abduction from the seraglio  
0,many of the character centric moments for the rest of the ensemble have been in service of michael burnham s story   this is the problem up to this season  stamets and culber s story was shown in how it impacted michael    her lover tyler was revealed as klingon after killing culber   burnham rescued tilly and culber from the mycellial space    saru s vaha rai had to be a bonding  sibling  moment with burnham   we re seeing more moments for the ensemble this season that are genuinely independent of michael  but as it stands now i can t imagine any number of the regular a plot starring turns for other players as was the norm in the 90s series taking place in discovery   these episodes really enriched those series and are deeply missed   we got a taste of a bit of this with the short treks  runaway  and  the brightest star   but we need more either within discovery or as shorts 
0,i figured that after the talk show visit and she s on the all access the stand show so they probably have plans for her for trek in some way 
0,i don t think it s an unpopular opinion that the mirror universe is a gimmick from tos that should be left to die  ds9 did it right calling it back with hammy over the top plots that were a fun break from the main story but even they went back probably one too many times  the only reason disco goes there so much is to distract from their lacking a plot 
0,i kinda liked the cheesy episodes  like the one with the cowboys  reminds me of the original series  but i get you 
0,star trek fan since the first  1966  season on tv  star trek 2009 is my favorite movie  not just st movies  all movies 
0,b elanna is my favorite engineer in all of trek  i think she got great character development over the course of the series  sure  she deserved to be center of attention more  but i disagree that she was just tough klingon and engineer we saw her grapple with her insecurities and discomfort with her klingon background   the episode where she considered genetically removing klingon features from her daughter in the womb was particularly good  the episodes where we saw her emotions regarding the maquis as others mentioned  and i thought her relationship with tom was well developed over the course of the series 
0,do you understand what the word aggregate means 
0,some folks really love the show after s02 but i can t ever get past s03 intro where they go back in time to kill hitler or something
0,who wants this  seems very trash  the first season was already a waste of time 
0,disco writers  please yes 
0,i stand by what i said  spoiled children acting like spoiled children and all  and as for my hissy fits  give me one good example 
0,the trial never stops   i m reminded of the episode where picard is shot in the heart    q provides a really interesting bounce off of the questions of humanity i think 
0,no their not   by the late 24th century even civilian ships had holo emitters on every deck 
0, gt  proof of what  riker telling troi that is federation values  what i m saying is that you re misuing their conversation  their values aren t applicable to the tuvix situationif you think the values aren t applicable then why did you bring them up  lol gt  but your analogy doesn t work for the very fact that sleeping people are still alive  of course they re still alive  that s why i mentioned denying them sleep lol  gt  yes  because i don t think you re understanding the difference between these two scenarios  in one there is an emergency where some people have to be sacrificed to save others i don t think you understand because that s the scenario we have in the episode lol  gt  in the other the emergency has ended and two people died  tuvok and neelix were still dead until janeway brought them back  so until then the emergency was still in full swing lol  plus  that s not a different scenario  that s the same scenario because it s the same emergency as before lol  gt  the question is whether to murder one innocent person to resurrect two others you forgot the other part  whether to murder two innocent people to keep one person alive lol  gt  i know why you want to compare them  but surely you can see why they are different scenarios that require different philosophies nope  it s kill one person or two people  only one philosophy needed because it s one scenario lol  unless you think it s a different scenario because like i said before you seem to think that sleeping people deserve consciousness but you seem to think dead people don t deserve life lol  like i said before lol  why the difference  gt  after all  that s what st has always been about you think star trek has always been about killing two people to save one  i don t think you understand star trek lol  gt  wrong  go back and rewatch the episode  the emergency had ended  people being dead doesn t constitute an emergency  life on voyager got back to normal  it s just that kes and janeway decided they miss their friends  two people were dead and would continue to stay dead unless someone did something about it  if that s not an emergency i don t know what is lol  life was about as far from normal as you could get for tuvok and neelix lol  kes and janeway missing their friends is also a symptom of life not being back to normal  even you admit that so you re contradicting yourself on life being normal lol  gt  holy cow man  you re really missing the point  not to mention trying salvage this analogy   no  they re not comparable  because death changes things  being dead isn t the same as being asleep  and it s different enough to make this analogy fall down  of course being dead is different than being asleep lol  the point of the analogy is why do you think the asleep deserve consciousness but the dead don t deserve life  you yourself said that  death changes things  again without giving proof lol  where s your proof  i guess you think lyndsay ballard shouldn t have been resurrected because according to you the dead don t deserve life lol  i d like to see what you say about resurrecting your friend tuvix after the episode  what excuse you make for going against your argument that the dead should stay dead lol  gt  see above  different scenario  not applicable  see above  same scenario lol  if you think it s the different scenarios then why did you bring up federation values  lol gt  what  mate  if you want your analogies to make sense you have to think them through  stealing under what conditions it s not an analogy lol  most people get that stealing is immoral lol  the federation gets it too lol  gt  what s that got to do with tuvix if you don t think it has anything to do with tuvix then why did you bring it up  lol gt  either way  absolute morality and federation values aren t the same  federation values are made by fallible people  so whether or not stealing       is right or wrong in your opinion is irrelevantthe values are the same about this  the federation thinks stealing is wrong too lol  it s not my opinion  it s a value that lots of people get  including the federation lol  gt  i m starting to think you re either a troll for misrepresenting my views  or you re just really bad at debating because i never said that  i think picard was right to shoot lynch  that has nothing to do with janeway  if it has noting to do with janeway then why did you bring it up lol  you said you would follow a person  picard  rather than what s right  i m showing you why that s a bad philosophy lol  gt  no  the core of the debate  which you said yourself  is whether janeway dealt with it in  the most federation way ever   that s separate to whether you personally believe it was the right thing  nope  the core of the debate is whether it s right or not lol  you do get my comment about  the most federation way ever  was a joke and meant that it was the right thing to do  right  because that should have been obvious lol  gt  again  you re just trolling at this point  or failing at comprehension of what i m saying  picard embodies federation values almost to the point of personification  which is why he wouldn t have murdered tuvix  that s all i m saying  again  you re saying these things without proof lol  you say picard embodies federation values  without proof i might add  and i assume the idea that the federation values are the right values is implied  again without proof lol   you also argue  without proof lol  that federation values are against killing tuvix  an assertion i ve already disproven with the stuff about riker and troi lol  any proof you want to bring up to defend your assertions  because otherwise you d by default have to concede they re not true lol  gt  literally wrong  again   tuvix was dealt with the most federation way ever      in your words  unless you think the federation  way  is different to federation values wrong on at least two counts lol  i already disproved this idea about my  words   so see above lol  also  a  way  is referring to actions not values lol  gt  proof of what  exactly  what they re saying  go and watch the episodes again lol  it ll take you 80 mins max  less if you cut out the tng ep and just watch the scene with riker and troi proof of your assertions obviously lol  see above if you want more details lol 
0,complaining that audience score is limited to rt users  and saying that 30 reviews is somehow better is kinda dumb  and what we see in reality   discovery   picard hovering around 45  and enterprise at 75 80   which also is in line with any opinion poll or majority of preference lists published  making critic s opinion not representative of anything
0,yes
0,tas probably beats it 
0,happy birthday  u mattandallthat   and deep space nine 
0,the short treks are good  i like thosehe isn t listed as having credits for lower decks on his wikipedia  but maybe that s just out of date i m excited for snw  but i m in the camp that a s31 show just shouldn t be made  they just want to make things dark for some reasonre  discovery and picard  i did not like sn 1 of discovery and i really did not like picard  both seem to really divide the trek fanbase  same with the movies he was involved with  they were watchable  but i don t particularly like them  give me the weird  save the whales  shit any day  if i want generic sci fi action i can watch damn near any other franchisewhat s worse is they all rely heavily imo on rehashing stuff instead of coming up with new ideas  it s kirk and spock  again  but with lens flare  it s another prequel and she s spock s secret sister  etc etc  again  in the sense of fairness  that all might just be shitty executives meddling with the production  there s no way for us to knowand again in the sense of fairness to discovery  it s gotten better every season  but in 2020 it shouldn t take 3 seasons for a show to become watchable  if this was any other franchise it would have been cancelledanyway  to not be a total downer  again i really liked ld and disco sn 3 has me hooked  so here s hoping that going forward things are good  but who knows
0,one of the things that s very noticeable in this season is that saru only takes in information and seeks input one on one lorca mostly just gave direction pike did a round table for options and input around the bridge or conference table which was good in principle    anson mount describes  it as using his officers as a  tiger brain    unfortunately  the way the writers did it  michael was always asked for her input proposal last and her solution was always the one taken   so  it just set michael up as the smartest voice in the room that pike always listened to rather than showing her to be a contributing member of a team with specific expertise   it would be as if in tng picard always asked data for input last and data was always right instead of having laforge and riker challenge and propose improvements 
0,my fav series 
0,holograms and robots are just as hard to come by as any other resources you would need
0,and that s the problem 
0,it seems like the point of that ritual was to get a greater insight into the hosts than the symbiont would usually allow   so perhaps like other things she learned in that episode from the other hosts jadzia wouldn t normally have access to that memory of curzon s 
0,i had not before now  and that is excellent 
0, you are now entering   the scary door  
0,i watched it for the first time recently i think it was trying too hard to be 2001  a space odyssey  the style was obviously heavily influenced  too many slow  panning shots of the ship and such  that being said i liked the story   it was very interesting and the twist at the end was cool 
0,well no  sisko dismissed him  he thought he wasn t being serious  he wasn t testing him  he was being dismissive based on preconceived notions of what ferengi are supposed to be  he was being totally biased and had to eat his words in the end 
0,honestly  i am not a fan of shoe horning in all the tng trek people instead of just telling the story   i really want to like  picard   but with the exception of hugh s character  and maybe seven of nine  the other cameos feel forced to me   and seven wasn t tng anyway 
0,sto isn t cannon 
0,i think either kurzon hid it from dax  or dax hid it from jadzia knowing it would complicate things for her in her mind
0,first film   this is fun  second film   this is actually really  really bad  third film   ok  it s an improvement  but still not good enough 
0,or phasers set to stun
0,no no that s the joke  sisko tests him by saying that
0,st dis also included the  uss hiawatha  as a significant part of s2e1  star trek moved beyond the names of american and british warships long ago  and we re better for it 
0,lol kirk as a badmiral
0,i think that one big part for picard being so high for me is that after the disappoinment of first 2 seasons of discovery  there was something familiar in terms of the main character of the show  it is possible that as time passes it will drop in rank  but at the moment it is high because of me enjoying it on the first watch through  enterprise was higher than voyager for me up until last summer when i rewatched it  i still enjoyed enterprise but much less than i on the previous watch throughs  but anyways  i also liked that on picard they did a slower story that took it s time and let people to get to know the world and changes that have happened after nemesis  and i really like soji as a character  picard did have some things that i disliked as well  like most parts of the final episode  not all of the characters were intresting  but yeah  overall it was a positive viewing experience that  for the time being at least  i am ranking high 
0,did you not see riker with the con standing on the enterprise bridge at wolf 359 saying  fire    that entire 2 parter was as much about riker s journey as picard s 
0,i doubt worf would agree with that   so massacring people is honorable by klingon standards   then they have no honor   there is no honor in a victory over someone who can t defend themselves 
0,absolutely  just aces from the writers 
0,i don t think that many of us have thought of the captain role as the  main character  in tng  deep space 9 or voyager   yes  the captains were the leaders of the ship and top of the call sheet so they got more lines  but they were often not the main character of the a plot in any given episode 
0,me too  wouldn t have started the older shows if it hadn t been for these movies  into darkness is definitely my favorite 
0,though  chief low dog   is the earliest known quote  both crazy horse and others did use it and i love phrase 
0,they could if they used holograms and robots for mining and ship construction 
0,i stand corrected  looks like i m the one eating shit   deleted 
0,there s no contradiction the critic score is aggregated from multiple sources the audience score is an average of only rotten tomatoes members it s only a contradiction if you don t understand the difference between those two things 
0,ya honestly  combs does great as shran  and the andorrans always seemed underused to me  nice to have them be in the forefront
0,if you don t know anything about nilsen  is she a main character 
0,pretty sure that was like bait to reel people in  then keep them hooked with new tng  
0,did you see that pretty neat kitbash someone made of the crazy horse i can only find this pintrest link right now
0,if they want to spend some budget  it could even be fun to have him show up de aged first  see picard  and then age himself up in mockery 
0,i m not sure i d say terrible  but it s definitely a one trick pony that should be used sparingly  much  much more sparingly than it s been used in recent years the two part  in a mirror darkly  from season 4 of ent  for example  was awesome 
0,wouldn t surprise me  there are plenty of khitomer references in there 
0,yeah  i don t care one way or the other  but stewart is indeed the kind of person who could just go on and surprise her with it in order to create a good  moment  for the show it also really doesn t take much to guess whoopi would love to be on the show she got herself onto tng via burton  iirc  and she s said many times how much she loves the franchise  afaik most of the tng cast still talk from time to time  so stewart would know whoopi was still interested i personally was more referring to that scheduling conflicts can happen  they might find they d rather have her in season 3  just a bunch of reasons why it s at least noteworthy to hear her repeat again that she hopes to be in season 2 
0,i remember watching yesterday s enterprise when it first aired and wondering briefly if it was a mirror episode  since they didn t explain what was happening right away 
0,i think it might be the best as well  it s my favorite  that s for sure i love the overarching plot  it s less vague than the others  even voyager s run often seemed like more of a mold to fit episodes into than the episodes themselves advancing the plot  that s not a bad thing  necessarily  it s just one reason why i like enterprise more and i love jeffery combs in it  i mean  he s great in everything  but i think his character in enterprise is his best in any star trek and archer is right up there with picard in my book
0,iirc nimoy only agreed to do the part as a tie in to undiscovered country to promote the film 
0,it would be tough to reconcile either data or worf in their current roles in the mirror universe  i don t see the terrans showing compassion in adopting an orphaned klingon or allowing him to serve as an equal among them  and yeah  data would either have been seen as a threat and destroyed or used his physical and cognitive superiority to advance himself beyond second officer of a starship 
0,is there some kind of graphic or write up that shows what caused such drastic changes in the number of worlds making up the federation    or was it actually gradual 
0,and mccoy was in tng premiere  was he not 
0,the point of a mirror universe episode is to show the good guys acting evil  tng never leaned very hard into that  but when they did  it was always data  and sometimes troi   data s programming goes wrong  or an energy orb takes him over  or a dying old genius pervert puts his soul into data  or data s evil twin shows up again  and  no disrespect to brent  but evil data was pretty much the same every time   by the time we got to descent part 2 and there were  two  evil datas on screen  i was pretty tired of him  and there was still masks yet to come i read  this book   back in the 90s  which answers the question of what a mirror universe tng episode may have looked like  it does  not  have an evil data  which i guess is a relief voy didn t do the mirror universe either  but episodes like living witness and worst case scenario accomplished the same aim discovery didn t seem to understand how or why to do a mirror universe episode when they decided to spend half the first season there  but they figured it out for season 3 
0,yeah  they had a blanket ruling of  no sequels  no comebacks   although this might have come into effect after bones  cameo in encounter at farpoint and the naked now being a sequel to the naked time  supposedly  gene roddenberry wanted the show to stand on its own two feet  which is the best way for them to work the first time we ever get any sense of continuity is sarek in the third season 
0, gt  one of their aims was ways to build tng on its own success  not just copy reference tos all the time  i m not sure that s entirely true  given the naked now was like the second episode 
0,i think they went with enough to follow the spirit of the original  but to be fair out 160  episodes  only 3 were written around returning cast members  not including mccoy in farpoint   and unification was made as a 25th anniversary  special  
0,at least george lucas had the good sense to kill anakin 
0,because the mirror universe is a terrible gimmick 
0,universe class uss enterprise j miranda class ships are a close second 
0,interesting theories 
0,i always thought that was a funny reason they gave us  they had a ship called enterprise and a lot of tos cast making cameos  even a 2 parter with spock  strange decision indeed 
0,i m with you 100  there  it doesn t even have to be 24 episodes a season  2 or 3 extra episodes that are more character focused than plot focused would go a long way  like the two mirror episodes there were this season  give the bridge crew those two episodes next season where they can have a break from saving the universe and show them interacting in a more casual setting  i absolutely loved the scene a few episodes back where the bridge crew were just sitting in the mess hall chatting  bring back the poker games i say
0,i haven t seen  lower decks   but i m not against it on principle   people seem to think it has been faithful  which is all that s really important to me   i plan to catch up eventually  picard  was a mess   i absolutely loved some episodes  and there were a couple i loathed   they definitely tried to do too much   the romulan stuff was great  the borg stuff was interesting but wasn t given enough time  and the android stuff was kind of awful   the show doesn t have the kind of budget that the studio inexplicably reserves for  discovery   but they write the episodes as if it did  and it shows   i really want to like it  but i m probably less fond of it now than i was when it ended 
0,   and happily exploring the universe furthering our knowledge of humanity   connections along the way 
0,is ds9 still canon after dis 
0,here s a star trek factory default show  focus on captain and bridge crew  self contained episodes  utopian future  explorer ship   captain s log   intro in space with memorable triumphant theme and lots and lots of resolving plots through discussion and inquiry   watching  the chase  with my brother  18 minutes in and he goes  nothing has happened  and i realised that this will always be the cost of making star trek properly  a lot of people will find it boring  better it be boring and treat the audience with respect than give us an explosion every 5 s to keep us watching 
0,one might conclude it was sarcasm  given how easily it fits the entire plot of deep space nine 
0,yeah  i just do not see the idea of a armada  using examples from andromeda  which is not even a trek show  does not help
0,it would help if in real life the navy  or management levels in any company or government  didn t have bad or politicking admirals    but my husband assures me that is not the case and they absolutely exist with x files you have the higher bureaucracy of the fbi and other government agencies  with the office  well   nuff said  stories told are engaging as they are relatable 
0,i repeat to myself   it s just a show  i should really just relax    but in all seriousness  i d ask myself if it s truly a contradiction or if there s something i m missing  if i can t reconcile it  i chalk it up to a writing error and leave it at that 
0,the romulan star empire is giant  the new federation that you are talking about is not  there is no way they could make a big enough fleet of heavily armed warships  or heavily armed warships at all
0,also  why would such a small organization care about the prime directive  i would wait a decade or 2 before fully becoming the idea of a better version of the federation  besides  since they would have no influence in peace treaties  attacks would have to be protected with a limited amount of tech  summary  would probably get killed by klingons  might make a good novel  on the real life side  and the klingon side
0,again  first part is being contradicted by the second i would prefer to call out the stupidity of your post thought  thanks
0,  
0,geezus  can you be any more sexist  how is she been pulled around by spock s will   if anything gives spock motivation  in the film it is  nero and the death of vulcan  uhura s was just a shoulder for spock to cry on in some cases   spock was wrong to put her on the wrong ship when she was qualified  to be ion the enterprise  its okay to have love for tos  but that is why kelvin is called an alternate reality the one film where uhura because spock s primary motivation is star trek beyond not star trek 2009 and beyond is seen as the best film of the jj movies 
0,fair enough the thing that really hurts the nuance of nu trek is the short season lengths  previous shows had twice as many episodes to tell their stories  which left a lot more room for fleshing out minor characters 
0,i have a suspicion that there is no data in the mu  i feel like terrans find the idea of synthetic life  or even synthetic life saving tech  repulsive  ariam was shown to have no augmentations  and to me that s a big giveaway  i also feel like  as a child born blind  geordi wouldn t have been allowed to live  if you are born weak or defective  you re not a real terran  i also feel like  without any mention of khan or the soong family in the mu  that the study of eugenics is contrary to terran ideals  arik soong wouldn t have been permitted any study of genetic augmentation  and the development of an artificial life form that s superior in so many ways  that would be a major threat 
0,critical reviews are a standard metric and a trusted source  you may not respect or appreciate what critical reviews represent  but it doesn t alter the fact that they do represent a neutral  professional review  critics  by the way  are in fact human beings the  audience review  isn t what it says it is   it s just rotten tomatoes users  there s as much value in that data as there is a twitter poll or a reddit poll    i e  next to none if you have a problem with it  feel free to create your own post to discuss the rt audience scores 
0,well  they made seven a murderer  ripped out icheb s eye  made picard a quitter  and starfleet such a lousy organisation their chief of security was a tal shiar agent  damned right i m aggressive 
0,im in the middle of the last episode so i will when im done 
0,hm  good point  what do you do when there s a contradiction 
0,there are mirror universe comic book which is decent 
0,i will concede that i may be wrong on that point  i only watched it once and it was some time ago  either way she is being pulled around according to spock s will and her sole role in the film was to give spock motivation  i didn t care for the film  but i will admit that i am very attached to the tos crew and that makes me biased away from reboots  lots of people liked it  for lots of people it is  their  trek  like how for a lot of people tng is holy grail trek  i m just happy for people to enjoy trek    the question invited us to talk about what was bad about the film  i scrolled down to see if anyone else had mentioned uhura and they hadn t  it s significant to me so i mentioned it lots of films have dismal representations of women  put women in the same tired positions  use women to create motivations for their male characters  etc  etc  it is far from unique to star trek 2009  or tng or tos or ent or      ultimately there is an absurd amount of content in the star trek universe  and more being made  hurrah   and no one is going to love all of it  that s okay 
0,british tv shows get 6 episodes per series  mini series sometimes 4 in total  movies get 90ish minutes  and not knowing who the characters are is not a common theme among those state of play had at least as many characters  i watched the six episodes total once 15  years ago  and i vividly remember the characters  personalities  i don t remember their names or every single story beat  but i d definitely be able to describe the people and their relationships to each other accurately and vividly clearly  it can be done so i wouldn t say that that s discovery s main problem in that regard 
0,green odos  lol
0, we are not friends  q   oh captain  yet again  your mouth fires daggers through where my human heart would be  
0, gt fingers crossed she doesn t murder anyoneyour passive aggressive comment isn t necessary 
0,at first i thought it was terrible cgi but now i see it s a whole face s worth of prosthetics   the eyes look dead and the chins and mouths are so weird  in the latest episode all i could do was stare at osyraa s mouth bc i def saw an  inner  cheek lip mouth  i think they did try to make the mouth a tad bigger but the real tragedy is that horrendous wig  i mean  it looks like a cheap cosplay halloween town wig  surely they could have afforded something better looking 
0,i feel like they should just use older jon de lancie  don t even bother to address the aging   same for whoopi  it would be  cool  from a special effect perspective  but i think as an audience  we get it  and having to do the sfx every time they would be in a scene would be costing more    and time  give that money to writing staff so that they can keep momentum and stories smooth through the mid point to finale  haha
0,one of their aims was ways to build tng on its own success  not just copy reference tos all the time  although there were a few call backs over the years  i guess the mu would have been one two many 
0,every  damned  day let s hope lifesimulation v2021ce is better 
0,i expect q to make picard human again

0, what  it s been 30 years since we ve seen each other  isn t this how i would look to you if i aged 30 years  mon capitan  i m just trying to make you feel comfortable  like you re hanging out with an old friend  
0,it s the same showrunners  guys  there s very little chance that this happens 
0,do we though i know i m in the minority but    personally  i m just not a fan of wizards and gods in star trek  and it depends a little bit  like  i d find high fantasy aspects a little more palatable in something like lower decks but picard is aiming to be all  grown up  and about action  politics and philosophy and i just don t think that characters that are essentially magic are a tonal fit  there s a reason most q episodes are comedy leaning  but that s just me i know that this has been a classic aspect of star trek since all the way back to charlie x and the likes  but it s never been my favourite  the guardian of forever in discovery felt like i was watching doctor who   and when i m in the mood for doctor who  i go watch doctor who    i m a big nostalgic myself  but i wish we d be a little more organized when it comes to where we let the reanimated skeletons of our childhood dreams dance  we certainly have enough star trek shows to choose from right now 
0,it was the previous comment that brought him up  not me  but i do take your point
0,basically me every time i read the news 
0,i can t wait until q makes picard a q 
0, gt reputationno i this is not  true  its quite the opposite  uhura got on board because she was qualified  spock did not put her on board first because he scared that it will be favouritism but he changes his mind when uhura states her record and achievement  i amp  x200b jj films have their flaws but the least we can do isnot to just lie about some factual things about them amp  x200b that just makes us    haters   amp  x200b also uhura was not a sex object in the movies  i think kirk is more sexualised than uhura 
0,so  i think the mandalorian is so effective because the creators realized they needed to get back to the basics of what made the original star wars work  it s an uncomplicated show inspired by the same western  samurai and flash gordon esque sources that inspired george lucas in his day  similarly  the original star trek was basically inspired by the golden era of sci fi short stories and novels  and many scripts were written by authors of that era   and twilight zone style story of the week storytelling where the plot is basically   something weird happens  and at the end of the episode we can reflect back on what lessons we take away from this experience   sometimes simpler is better  they need to pull the stakes back  the entire universe doesn t need to be at stake every season  that works for marvel tentpole films and doctor who  which are both more space wizardry than sci fi  something like  charlie x  is so quaint and lovable in comparison to all the new stuff  i sometimes think a low budget would help the franchise by forcing writers to focus on writing simpler  more engaging stories you can film on your starship set and your alien planet soundstage made of foam rubber rocks and a green sky  that s really what made star trek so good from the beginning  the stories overcame the fact that the starship is made of plywood  and the alien critter is a dog in a fur coat with rubber horn on his head   barely a special effect to be seen in the enemy within beyond the transporter effect  and it s one of the classics of the whole franchise  i think i read that discovery s budget is something like  8 million dollars per episode  everything from the production to the melodrama to the stakes in the stories just feels so far overblown  dial it back 
0,your second paragraph gave me chills about the stamets that might have been there  well written 
0,also appropriate of the writers to pay homage him as the original source of the phrase  today is a good day to die  
0,the 60s design and fuchsia colors are one of the chief appeals of tos for me  it s an aesthetic you don t see much of anymore  in movies and tv today  we usually see drab colors and varying shades of dark  i don t mind that  grounded  approach from time to time  but it s become so monotonous there s a whole history of design that movies and television can pull from  but it feels like no one wants to take any risks  the goal seems to be to make your visuals as boring as possible so they just disappear into the background 
0,lower decks has potential discovery  the first two seasons all revolved around aspects of trek lore that i just find to be uninteresting  war with the klingons  the mirror universe  section 31 so i wasn t super into it  the third season has been better but the last four episodes have  overall  been not great imo picard was trying to do too many things in too few episodes and as a result didn t really do any one thing all that well 
0,yeah i m hoping that burnham s call to her mom gets not just the vulcans to show up but the klingons too  old federation allies coming together  and who s at the head of the fleet  maybe a descendant of l rell 
0,i kind of wonder that if we see q on picard  if they will use that de aging cgi on him to make him look how he was back in the 90s  since q is supposed to be a part of a immortal race of god like beings  unless they just say that q felt like he wanted to make himself look older
0,no worries my friend  we are all related  and both you and i learned something valuable today 
0,sure   on the other hand   data s day  was the 85th episode   by the time discovery gets to episode 85  they ll be on season 7

0,i just realized one other niven connection  the title of the latest discovery episode   there is a tide  is exactly the title of a niven short story about finding tides on a planet with no apparent moon 
0,maybe  but i still suspect chabon is what brought that bucketload of creativity to picard  so regardless of the nature of his sitting back for picard  i hope that creativity endures  but also edited a little bit better
0,i enjoy all of these series  i just finished lower decks season 1 and love that take on trek 
0,i regret i don t speak any indigenous languages  hence my anglicized spelling  
0, gt  wouldn t surprise me if that was rodenberry who seemed to want to insert overtly sexual races into the show every now and then  like the ferrengi who wore codpieces initially because rodenberry wanted them to have massive dicks people always wonder why rick berman seems so obsessed with well endowed women in skintight outfits 
0,chabon left picard because a tv adaptation of some of his other written work was greenlighted  i don t know exact details because i m not very familiar with his written work 
0,frankly the other admiral leading the fleet would ve made more sense  and the line about kicking commodore oh s treacherous ass would ve had more personal depth to it
0, gt  ruined  eh for me and many others yeah  i don t begrudge anyone else their fandom mind you  yet  if you ll excuse the  a bit much  description  watching nutrek is like watching the skin of a loved one being worn by the alien parasite that killed them  can t really look away for foolish hope your loved one is still in there  yet can t abide how horrifyingly wrong it all feels  amp nbsp   well   i   did   warn   it   was   a   bit   muchbut yeah  stargate is literally the last of the three great star franchises that hasn t had bad robot or secret hideout pilot them into an era that harshly divides the fandom and drives away a lot of lifelong fans  you can have whatever opinion you wish on whether bad hideout star trek or bad robot star wars have been good or not but there s no denying they ve fractured the fandoms of these franchises 
0,in the new star trek  tmp art book  they make a point of emphasizing that many of the designs and ideas were around for phase ii  the planned reboot   and that they merely ramped up the sfx to be on the level of 2001 star wars  etc when phase ii was scrapped  they moved it into film production 
0,i d not mind an episode or series where lower decks personnel just bs the whole watch  more of just a worldbulding series where they talk about sports  or entertainment  scuttlebutt  or just do trek related  would you rather     no shootouts  disasters  casualties  it would give it an amazing authentic feel  but incredibly difficult to write for and it might be too niche 
0,nimoy agreed  and said that he found the entire film  depressing   because it focused so much on special effects that the characters seemed to rarely be on the screen it is interesting to think that most of the designs for phase ii and some of the more basic plot elements were before star wars was released   it does feel like  when watching tmp  though  that they rightfully had no idea if this would spawn a sequel  so they went with the trend of  big  sfx to try to slide in some mainstream audiences 
0, gt honestly you do not do such a thing if it has not been decided i dunno about that  she started crying  someone said  that doesn t sound prearranged  under most circumstances  most people wouldn t do this unless it was prearranged  but it seems like patrick stewart is exactly the kind of person who could say  i want whoopi on the show and people accommodate him  even for a dream sequence  but  i will concede that it was probably talked about beforehand  even if they were just spitballing 
0,jj has a kind of story character nihilism that really showed in the sequel series though  he has a way of developing something so badly it makes you feel like a fool for having been drawn in by the premise

0,second one is contradicting the first  and critical reviews are not representing anything at all  while audience score can at least give you some idea what human beings prefer  why would you bring up the list of opinions of critics to discuss it with people who are not critics at all  take it to critics then

0,1  critical reviews are still widely used and respected  just because the angry youtubers have decided they re worthless when they disagree with them doesn t mean they aren t still a valued view 2  the average for audience is a skewed metric as it s based on registered users of rotten tomatoes  rather than a broad picture like the critic score  which is aggregated from multiple reviews   when rt figures out how to aggregate the audience score  it ll be a worthwhile thing to discuss

0,sounds like you are referring to sttmp  with your reply comment   i am certainly no expert on st lore but i thought it was said the voyager probe disappeared into a black hole and that is how it ended up so far away to encounter that machine techy space culture   this culture tracked down where the voyager probe came from and that is why it returned to the earth in stiv i thought they said that space culture was listening to whale songs emanating from the earth that propogated through space    is that even possible   probably not   and when the whale songs stopped due to whales becoming extinct the space culture sent a probe to find out what happened to the whales both are pretty wild and nonsensical if you think about it

0,please don t get me wrong  i don t expect to have an in depth biography presented to me the viewer and i know very well that disco the programme is set up different to other trek with the  main character  not being a captain and all  and i do very much enjoy disco  but at least with o brian after a couple appearances i knew his name  and there was even a whole episode where he got married  and another where he had a kid  and he was just the transporter chief  sure he wasn t the prime focus of those episodes but that s still some big character development 
0, gt 	how dare they develop his character more than he had been in the 30 years prior and then give him a meaningful death meaningful this guy had been running the borg reclamation project  we barely get to know what the project is about  then the show takes a turn  airlocks countless drones  executes xbs  and kills off the project director because he no longer served a plot point i don t see how that was meaningful  it was cruel and pointless   welp  guess we don t know what else to do on the artifact

0,yeah i think you re right  but it was only so effective because of all the other episodes  which i didn t really care for 
0,bottom line we re entitled to interpret the situation and the actions taken separately  neither of us is right or wrong have a nice day
0,right  and typically a show will use a character like this to boost interest before a new show season premieres  there s a lot of planning timing involved in that  look at the interview with burton from like may 2020  he s pressed and all but confirms he s coming back  but awkwardly stops short of a definitive statement

0,i want more guinan  but i hope they don t explore her backstory  guinan works so well as a mysterious sage like character  especially with picard  providing details and answers often lead to disappointing revelations
0,personally i don t believe any of them  i think there are grains of truth in each story  but even in the state he was in he d never give any true details about himself that could be separated from all the rest  the only real thing we learn are his feelings about himself and his  betrayal  of cardassia  and that he is someone who can come up with very convincing lies with little time and under duress 
0,ugh  i hate guinan   the show is borderline unwatchable with the woke bs  and this will make it worse  too bad nobody that matters is reading

0,i would welcome more exploration as well   the world s the show has been creating are well done   it would be enjoyable to see more of those 
0, boring and mundane  is the wrong phrase  i think  what i want is starfleet officers doing their jobs and doing them well  no mutinies  no scheming or talking about each other in secret  more doing tasks professionally and achieving some goal  one season where the entire universe is not at stake i want to see people who are experts in their field doing their jobs competently 
0,agreement  less is more in these situations 
0,or she gets her eyeball yanked out and dies   
0,i m not saying they looked bad  by any means  they were well done effects  they were just pointless  they didn t add anything really useful to the movie  they d already established the size of v ger with the klingons in the opening  and they could have done the mind meld in 30 seconds of flashes since they had spock explain what it all meant in detail right after anyways 
0,i hope they never do a  deep dive   the mystery of guinan and her people is part of what makes her such an intriguing character 
0,just 12 different scenes of burnham crying would have also summed up the year nicely 
0,again  he s a vulcan and tuvok was notoriously neutral until prime factors 
0,i completely agree  american films and series have are disproportionately trying to make up for past failures with respect to women  gays  blacks etc  this is one of the reasons the share of non american films series i am watching has skyrocketed 
0,they are listeners
0,yup  i think that episode made pic better  overall  the three final ones that followed it  though  were overstuffed 
0,that worked better for me  it s an allegory of what can happen when  say  you ban stem cell research   eh  eh  americans   than  rios  also  having a traumatic android related story from his past  why  why couldn t they make rios  just  a captain disgruntled with starfleet 
0,i hope not  i always loved the guinan picard support they gave each other the implicit trust 
0,paris is too tall  unless the doctor could give him the ol cotton hill procedure and then reverse it  lol 
0,stop making fown of him 
0,fair enough then  it s just that pic is a good show that suffers from the frantic writing and or production  if they sort that out  it could be really great 
0,i d love that  does the situation with the q  that took place in voyager   the child he had etc  change  how q will interact at this time with picard  has he changed at all 
0,sorry  it s my word for those moments in film where characters watch  stare  gape in amaze  etc  spielberg does it a lot but st tmp is full of it 
0,wife and i are watching ahs and he s in a few seasons 
0,in s1  the riker troi episode was added during the production  and the scene in the finale with riker coming with a fleet and saving the day was already shot with admiral  sheer fucking hubris  instead of riker  it was reshot after frakes was contracted 
0,season 2 and 3 is filming back to back across the whole year   20 episodes total   so it s possible guinan s role isn t until season 3    in which case those episodes are unlikely to have been finalised yet 
0, gt 	i bet you still enjoy watching kevin spacey movies too there s a difference between  actor s political views don t align with that of a character  and  actor sexually harasses colleagues  
0,for about 54 years now 
0,do you realize that all of star trek is in a holodeck for the q  that s why they appear to be god like 
0, gt rather than the pure filler episode sirtis and frakes gotwait  isn t that what is universally celebrated in classic trek from a huge lot of people that don t like new trek  those  breather  episodes that let you know the characters better in a low stakes bottle story 
0,especially when we are living in the middle of a pandemic  she could just be worried that the production will stop 
0,i d like to see him show up de aged  make some comment about how old picard is looking  and snap his fingers to change his appearance to match  would neatly explain why an immortal being has aged and avoid having to use de aging effects for his whole screen time 
0,stewart holds all the cards on this show  unfortunately  so i m sure he could have made good on an off the cuff invitation 
0,something booker does in season 3  but there is clearly a limit on the process otherwise supplies of fresh dilithium wouldn t be a necessity  throughout the tng era there are multiple references to dilithium mining  so i think it s a fair assumption that recrystallising isn t an infinite process 
0,interesting  thanks for this info 
0, deleted 
0,whoopi  it wasn t  rape  rape  goldberg  yay 
0, gt and are you really so weak  and so miserable  that you need to destroy star trek canon permanentlyoh the drama 
0,i know picard is filmed in california while discovery is shot in ontario  but i would like to guinan appears on discovery  for her  1000 years is nothing
0,if you know nothing about star trek they re fun movies  but right from the start they gave personality transplants to the entire crew and i can t get passed that
0,an actor s behaviour dose influence the narrative depending on what they have done  roseanne barrs was fired from her own tv show  if the actor hadnt been such a douch they may of asked him back for picard  instead they replaced and killed his character off 
0,  
0,what  star trek in general or the entire franchise 
0,you re implying the writers understand guinan as a character   and won t just make her sarcastic and angry  putting down picard for some flaw she sees like every other character in the show   if not make her do some exaggerated fight scene with a borg or  insert galaxy destroying threat mystery magguffin here  
0,starfleet officers have implants in their head meant to instantly communicate emergencies or secret information from starfleet to flag officers  they really push the tech in tmp novelization to be more advanced than even discoveries 31st century tech 
0,not necessarily   hopefully  is used to talk about things that are definitely planned  but still in the future as well  i ve certainly used in that way 
0,what is spielberging  looked it up and all i found was an urban dictionary definition  filming your own shit  and unless you ve seen a cut of the movie i m not aware of  i m guessing that isn t what you mean   
0,i liken it to the art and antiquities world  my irl job deals to both of these to an extent  from a more exterior perspective   quality  honesty and talent come secondary to the personal pocket books of those who can network the best  and they will fight without a second thought for anything but themselves to maintain it 
0, a stitch in time 
0, hopefully i will be joining their cast  is pretty clear that she hasn t yet joined the cast  yes  the rest is supposition based on that i do think the most likely scenario is that the interview was recorded a few months ago since print magazines have a long lead time 
0,john de lancie recently said that we will see more of him  or something similar  in 2021  so we might get q in picard season 2
0,except burnham would justify it by saying  for instance  that removing discovery from inside federation hq prevents it from being used as a bomb to destroy the stronghold of the federation 
0,nimoy is spock  period 
0,spin the camera around the table  lense flare  close up  lense flare  spin  close up  lense flare  end scene me  wtf were they talking about  i forgot to listen 
0,i m in the uk  so still not seen lower decks  i wasn t keen on the idea when i first heard about it  but ive heard good things   so i look forward to watching it discovery has been uneven  and i do have issues with some of the plotting  but i ve enjoyed it for what it is all the way through  and am really enjoying series three  i was really looking forward to picard  and enjoyed the first few episodes  my enjoyment tailed off quickly  and it rapidly became the only star trek show i genuinley dislike   i ve always felt that discovery is in a post enterprise temporal wars timeline  not strictly a prequel to tos and the others  which they confirmed this season   so i can accept discontinuities or differences in technology quite happily picard is very difficult to accept as being the future of tng  it just doesn t work for me  the future is irreconcilable with the world of tng ds9 voyager  and the revisiting of old characters and insisting on giving them all massive trauma and or killing them off has managed to spoil my enjoyment of those past shows when i watch them now personal opinion  i wish they hadn t made it 
0,i love guinan  i hope they get into her background more 
0, gt some people aren t really angry at a thing  they are just angry  maybe at themselves  maybe at life  but they have allowed their emotional state to override their rationality and impartiality  squints at the perpetual hissy fit that is your posting history 
0,i think when burnham ran away last time  she didnt jeopardize the whole federation  stammet falling into ec hands on the other hand   
0,and now chabon isn t the showrunner for picard anymore    probably because you can t have such a gradient of talent between the two and it work
0,the cardinal sin would be wearing purple
0, gt  but who ever said you can t have just a little fun while you re saving the day and sabotage by the beastie boys is certainly apropos 
0,oh for fuck s sake    the character was already recasted  it wasn t the same actor  and actors aren t their characters  an actor s irl behaviour shouldn t have any influence on the narrative  especially since he s not been that character in what 30 years and has already been recasted 
0,here here  they could share stories  making it an anthology series  with different sets of characters each week 
0,if i had a million dollars    i d buy you a k car    a nice reliant automobile  forgive my pun   i m the mod of  r barenakedladies
0,they let the doctor turn himself off eventually
0,fingers crossed
0,it s good  but it is extremely fast paced  the dialog is non stop  there s almost no time to reflect on what s going on  but it is more like tng than dsc or pic 
0,jj abrams is really good at distracting from poor storytelling by brilliant camera work and visual effects but once you re past the bling  all you re left with is a mediocre movie with huge potholes and characters that don t make sense   
0,it used to be filmed like a teleplay with emphasis on dialogue   i like the new stuff too  script and acting are amazing  but it can sometimes be just tiring    i find myself wishing they d slow down for a pint at quark s and have some low key banter for an occasional scene to brace the pace and allow us to relate a bit more with the characters between battle scenes
0,benson    but seriously he was the best in boston legal   not counting ds9
0,he s come a long way since he was an american military priest during the korean war 
0,balance of terror  
0,except that it doesn t  you have to go with onscreen evidence  otherwise  you re just making stuff up 
0,i mean  if they re going to subvert wrath of khan  a great way to do that would be to have doctor marcus in charge of a secretive experimental torpedo that houses a grand new leap in technology  and it s taken over by a strong charismatic superman who  just isn t khan   that d be a twist right there  even show uhura and spock researching possible candidates for who this guy could be and bring up images of ricardo montalban as khan  but it s not khan  it s  john harrison   giving an opportunity for an exposition scene where they explain him whoever made into darkness clearly only watched wrath of khan and didn t watch space seed 
0,and the one line of dialog in that scene i thought perfectly represented the entire series    
0,ethan peck by a mile  looking forward to seeing more of him in strange new worlds  i know quinto tried his best  but honestly didn t seem like spock at all to me  mind you  he had those terrible scripts to work with too  so i guess it s not all his fault 
0,stephen manley
0,absolutely  absolutely  i get a lot of weird looks when i say i liked picard because despite all its flaws there s actually some interesting themes being tossed around  everytime its almost going to deliver though something totally unrelated derails the whole thing  and it very much smells like kurtzman we got the short straw  i kinda hoped when j j got his original dream of making star wars he d drop star trek like a hot turd and move on  sadly he left his proteges to continue the work he started 
0,so   they   started the temporal war 
0,  discovery    this is the most frustrating to me because it has the most potential to be good out of the three shows  but the writing consistently fails it  discovery presents a lot of interesting ideas  but the writers are either incapable or disinterested in developing each idea appropriately before dumping it or shoving it into the background so they can introduce some new idea to the mix  the result is a show filled with action and emotional climaxes that feel totally unearned because the groundwork wasn t done to make those moments actually mean anything to me as a viewer and to make matters worse  the writers keep twisting the plots so that michael  the least interesting cast member  can be at the centre of it all  the lengths they have gone to have her involved in each episode are comical at times  the experiment of having a star trek show where the lead character isn t the captain figure has been a total failure so far  it has hurt the overall narrative of each season  it has hurt the episodic plots by trying to jam her into stories she doesn t belong in  it has hurt the other cast members due to their reduced screen time  and it has hurt michael herself due to over exposure breeding contempt   picard    the worst of the three so far  a jumbled mess of ideas that completely failed to come together into a cohesive narrative  filled with ridiculous clich√©s that were supposed to make the show  gritty   and which descended into absolute farce by the finale  and sadly  the picard in picard is no longer the picard i admired from tng  this is what happens when you give patrick stewart too much creative control over the character  he tries to twist the character into a mary sue of himself the difference between discovery and picard to me is that i believe that discovery is salvageable if only the show had a writing staff that was capable and willing to put the work in to make it a great show  whereas picard was so poorly executed in its first season that i seriously doubt there s anything that could be done to fix it   lower decks    this is going to be the most subjective of the three because that s the nature of comedy  personally  i didn t find the show funny  nor even amusing  what s worse  i found the character of mariner extremely obnoxious  which made the show a chore to watch most weeks  it s actually the best written of the shows on a structural level  and it s kinda bizarre that it s the comedy show that knows how to structure plots better than the drama shows considering how that aspect of storytelling is a lot less important in comedy than in drama  basically  i don t like what lower decks is or what it s trying to be  but that s just due to my completely subjective tastes  i prefer what discovery and picard are intended to be  but i feel those shows are failing completely at their goals 
0,you better hope it doesn t 
0,my take is that it s this showrunner dicatatorship style of production  sometimes it s great if you get a genius like feige  or give trust directly to directors in feature films  but sometimes you get cruds like kennedy in star wars  those writers in got  or now kurtzman in star trek  take picard  chabon is a pulitzer prize winner  picard has lots of genuinely amazing and intriguing avenues  characters and themes  but none are developed  non are edited  and the overall plot has to be some fucking alien tentacle shit because kurtzman has obviously got some shithead master plan to unite a common antagonist of some kind of control type  so our heroes can avengers assemble  and none one will care 
0,they are doing 20 more episodes   filming basically the entire year   stewart said he d want to go 3 seasons  so they are doing the final 2  this year 
0,i always thought it was interesting that at the end of  ship in a bottle   the computer just ignores barclay rather than chiming in with an error message or something  phil farrand suggests that this is because he actually is a hologram himself and the computer is treating him as part of the program 
0, he s dead jim  
0,i haven t watched picard or discovery  i can t unless i watch it with  cindy jean so i m stuck dying without watching  dis  pic  and lower decks 
0,i ve often thought that bringing in  name  directors would be an interesting strategy for star trek going forward  the problem  i suspect  is that they d want relatively strong levels of creative control that  trek  has traditionally been unwilling to cede 
0,miranda class all the way  it s like the k car of trek ships  a basic workhorse design in use from tos era all the way up to the dominion war 
0,that sound    one of the most horrifying in cinema 
0,it s control
0,what i hope for is something that refers to measure of a man and the morality of androids in the federation  because it looks like androids in picard became the thing they held a tribunal to try and prevent i m worried that we ll get a bit of fan service and some kind of send off  a heroic sacrifice kind of thing 
0,the fact that they gave him a commendation tells me that  at least  they didn t say you couldn t muck with the test beforehand that probably changed afterward 
0,just because the interview was recent doesn t mean they just brought her onto the show  this is a lot of supposition 
0,optimally  shouldn t be ship be called  tashunka witko  rather than  crazy horse  
0,i m actually really mad at discovery because it has such a huge gap between it s potential and what it actually delivers the setting  the visual effects and the actors are all top off the line and could form up to something truly great  but the series suffers just so much from lazy and unimaginative writing lower decks is a really great series  but imho it would be just as great in a generic sci fi setting like final space or rick and morty  so idk  i do enjoy it tremendously all the same picard is a weird one for me because it suffers the same problems as discovery  albeit to a lesser extent   but true to it s name  picard just bludgeons these problems info submission with sheer force of personality  i honestly didn t even notice most of them at first and emotionally and philosophically it s a clear continuation of tng  which is a nice breather from the modern  shot first  ask questions never  attitude of more modern incarnations of trek 
0,i m with you  it is a great movie  its probably the most star trek of all the star trek movies in my opinion  the story is great  i actually love the slow stately pacing of the story  and it has a suitably epic payoff  the visual effects are gorgeous and the film as a whole is beautifully shot  top it off with jerry goldsmith knocking it out of the park with his incredibly lush score and you have a great movie   my only real complaints with the film are the terrible costumes and how utterly devoid of humor it is 
0,true  i loved his interactions with the major especially   somehow garak always brought out a new dimension from each character
0,disco season 3   enjoyed every second except georgie porgie and carlld   no complaints come to mindpicard   loved it but i was put off by doctor i mudered a guy but i m cute so its ok  also did they ever explain why androids must be created in pairs  it s obviously a nod to data and lore  but never really made sense to me 
0,we seriously need some more q guinan in picard s2
0,or like icheb though i think the actor was a sex pest and a cunt so they had to let that charator die 
0,excellent   
0,she would be perfect to add back story  perspective  etc    coming from a long lived race  and another point of view 
0,i really hope they stop with these quick cameos lasting 1 2 episodes  extend the amount of episodes decreasing budget per episode  let characters have fully fleshed out arcs  etc 
0,yeah  i enjoyed it  but did they need to make the vulcans so hateful 
0,if she likes and has seen sci fi tv series before  tng  if not  ds9 or voyager 
0,it doesn t work when you re the hologram 
0,that s hateful of her to want to ruin the show for us 
0,why would you think the future was a parallel universe  they pretty explicitly stated many times they were travelling into their own future i do agree that it would be nice to get some exploration stories at some point but imo this storyline of rebuilding in a post post apocalypse is great  given how things are going in the world right now with one political scandal after another against the backdrop of a civilisation ending threat  it s nice to have a story that shows there s always light at the end of the tunnel  to quote georgiou  even the darkest night ends  it s also nice that compared to the other two seasons they aren t literally trying to save the universe galaxy  they re trying to improve the lives of ordinary people living through harsh times incidentally the new strange new worlds show will hopefully scratch that exploration itch  it s supposed to be out later this year  which will be great for all trekkies    we ll have shows that can focus on different kinds of stories 
0,what fresh abomination is this 
0,after q amp a i m hoping for a number one led musical episode of strange new worlds 
0, u monsieurcatsby  i have found an error in your comment   gt   why   its      it s    like this when it might have been better if you  monsieurcatsby  had typed  why   its      it s    like this when  instead   its  is possessive   it s  means  it is  or  it has     this is an automated bot  i do not intend to shame your mistakes  if you think the errors which i found are incorrect  please contact me through dms or contact my owner elitedamyth  
0,no you re right the two aren t mutually exclusive  its just galling that we aren t getting both from what should be a tent pole franchise  its priorities are just misplaced  and misused  and its i think whats hurting some fans the most is there s no reason why its like this when everyone else seems to be able to make both good and profitable shows 
0,nothing wrong with a bit of character development  it d be a refreshing change from disco 
0,there was also an excelsior class ship named lakota in a ds9 episode 
0,not a perspective thing   they do   they decided that ship interiors were too small to fit a bunch of players at once so they scaled the interiors up   which means ships have 20 to 30 foot high ceilings 
0,this is what i m hoping for 
0,if you re a side character on tng or voy you are so far set to be doomed on picard  i hope guinan and q dodge that bullet 
0,more wokeness   yay 
0,agreed on both your guys  points  her character never did anything for me  i d be good with not devoting much time to her in the new series  maybe a quick 1 ep  cameo  if she becomes part of the regular crew in this show it s going to be cringey 
0,i m from the south  i ll have a watch again and see  to my ear  it was like an american actress doing an english accent but forgetting to stay in character  or vice versa 
0,happy birthday to you 
0, gt  you seem to have forgotten you were saying you addressed the federation values vs riker telling troi otherwise without giving proof lol proof of what  riker telling troi that  is  federation values  what i m saying is that you re misuing their conversation  their values aren t applicable to the tuvix situation gt i didn t say it was the same thing  i said there were similarities lol  the major one being saying the dead don t deserve life and saying the asleep don t deserve consciousness are both illogical lol but your analogy doesn t work for the very fact that sleeping people are still alive   gt like killing holo laforge isn t murdering him but a utilitarian decision  riiiight lol  because it s a utilitarian decision it s totally different from the utilitarian decision to kill tuvix  riiiiight lol yes  because i don t think you re understanding the difference between these two scenarios  in one there is an emergency where some people have to be sacrificed to save others  in the other the emergency has ended and two people died  the question is whether to murder one innocent person to resurrect two others  i know why you want to compare them  but surely you can see why they are different scenarios that require different philosophies  after all  that s what st has always been about   gt tuvok and neelix were still dead  sounds like the emergency was still in full swing lol wrong  go back and rewatch the episode  the emergency had ended  people being dead doesn t constitute an emergency  life on voyager got back to normal  it s just that kes and janeway decided they miss their friends   gt right like denying someone consciousness and denying someone life is totally not comparable at all  riiiiight lol holy cow man  you re really missing the point  not to mention trying salvage this analogy   no  they re not comparable  because death changes things  being dead isn t the same as being asleep  and it s different enough to make this analogy fall down    gt what do you think i was saying with riker and troi  lolsee above  different scenario  not applicable   gt so whether stealing vs not stealing is the right thing is subjective and up for debate  riiight lol what  mate  if you want your analogies to make sense you have to think them through  stealing under what conditions  what s that got to do with tuvix  either way  absolute morality and federation values aren t the same  federation values are made by fallible people  so whether or not stealing       is right or wrong in your opinion is irrelevant gt so just becuase you disagree with janeway you d do whatever picard does  you d shoot up ensign lynch so that he looks like swiss cheese just because you disagree with janeway  loli m starting to think you re either a troll for misrepresenting my views  or you re just really bad at debating because i never said that  i think picard was right to shoot lynch  that has nothing to do with janeway   gt whether janeway did the right thing in killing tuvix is the core of the debate  unless you think we re arguing about troi and riker  lolno  the core of the debate  which you said yourself  is whether janeway dealt with it in  the most federation way ever   that s separate to whether you personally believe it was the right thing   gt i was talking about picard s values since you brought it up  not tuvix lol  keep up lol  you seem to not want to talk about tuvix anyway since you said this isn t about tuvix  so i think you d welcome talking about picard lol again  you re just trolling at this point  or failing at comprehension of what i m saying  picard embodies federation values almost to the point of personification  which is why he wouldn t have murdered tuvix  that s all i m saying   gt you re the one who brought up federation values not me lol  keep up lol literally wrong  again   tuvix was dealt with the most federation way ever      in your words  unless you think the federation  way  is different to federation values  gt again  proof  blustery claims about how something is wrong isn t proof lol proof of what  exactly  what they re saying  go and watch the episodes again lol  it ll take you 80 mins max  less if you cut out the tng ep and just watch the scene with riker and troi 
0,so what if she s an actor  i bet you still enjoy watching kevin spacey movies too  sometimes a person s private life ruins their fictional persona  pretty basic concept  sorry that you can t grasp it goldberg was awful to progressives  openly mocked people that wanted affordable healthcare and a better quality of life  she has spent years next to megan mccain spreading corporatist propaganda on daytime television  in a fictional trek world where class warfare and money don t exist  it s surprising that goldberg doesn t find that future abhorrent  and are you really so weak  and so miserable  that you need to destroy star trek canon permanently  just to get your nostalgia kicks guinan is from a long lived species  picard could be in his 100s  yet guinan would look the same as tng  she s 600 years through her 1000 year lifespan  but sure  through in an old lady goldberg  ruin it they made the same mistake in season 1 of trash picard  brent spiner said for years    that it didn t make sense for him to play data  data doesn t age  unlike spiner  so what do the writers do  they throw in an aged  wrinkled  overweight data  what garbage  terrible series 
0,vance could very well have been elected and the admiral rank is honorary   the us president is the commander in chief of the us military so it s not that much of a stretch that in this time where the federation is all but gone  they could do something like this 
0,i don t know  i think star trek can be good and profitable  look at various franchises that have renewed themselves from a solid standpoint  batman  nolan era   bond films under mendes  those were both hugely profitable because they were a   the franchise and b   really fucking good  i mean  game of thrones didn t become the success it did because it was trying to be something else  and despite my boredom of its formula  there is always a base standard of decency from marvel films  trek falls short because it s a  not quality  and b  not trek as it was  let s not conflate the argument  but people insist on doing so  i d take either a  or b  but to be a success it needs to be both  to bring the legacy fans onboard  but attract a whole new generation  by being good drama in the first place 
0,lovable longshots include joe w  davis  stephen manley  vadia potenza  carl steven  billy simpson  liam hughes and an unknown infant 
0,it is  slow pacing is the only complaint which we can easily fast forward  i love it especially the idea of voyager especially now that it has gone to a place where density has changed which is nuts    and if it returns somehow then we know this movie was the real thing lol
0,probably doesn t mean much  corps do this all the time as another post mentioned  that said  i would be down for an adaption of the destiny trilogy

0,never start with ds9 
0,lower decks is hilarious
0,man  discovery was hot garbage for most of season one and two 
0,you have noticed the gormagander space whale species that the show came up with and that occasionally appears 
0,i miss the bright pink and blue of the tos romulan uniforms  they need to bring that back  all the antagonists in tng are so drab 
0,i know exactly what you mean  the idea that i should accept declining quality because it s profitable  the show is no longer willing to push back and make waves because those in charge are fully on board with profit first to line their own pockets  the two don t have to be mutually exclusive  but you have to be willing to put your neck on the line to push the envelope  the idea that trek needs to be modernised is a fallacy to me  what they mean is that trek needs to make loads of money and provide lots of merch to consume because that s the way a large portion of the viewers now engage with entertainment  its less about content and more about the  universe  and all its associated interconnected media  and its often at the expense of consistent quality  kurtzman is a j j acolyte and i m reminded of a j j interview from a few years back when he made  09  star trek  always felt like a silly  campy thing  i remember appreciating it  but feeling like i didn t get it  i felt it didn t give me a way in  there was a captain  there was this first officer  they were talking a lot about adventures and not having them as much as i would ve liked  maybe i wasn t smart enough  maybe i wasn t old enough  but the twilight zone i was obsessed with  loved it    i had no idea there had been 10 movies  i still haven t seen them all  i didn t want to become a student of star trek  i felt that was actually one of the few advantages i had  i was trying to make a movie  not trying to make a trek movie   the problem is that you can t ignore past trek when making new trek because its an idea rather than a finished product  if you don t get that then you re wasting my time as a consumer  your product is not what you advertised to me j j and cronies basically said  we don t understand this thing  and we re not interested in trying because its easier and more profitable to us to just rebrand our current product and sell you that instead  and i m supposed to tow the line and buy the merch because its branded star trek  the new shows have a lot of good things that can be said of them  but it s all for naught with the current execution as its becoming clearer that what they re aiming for is always going to be safely vanilla  and in the era of social justice and change i expected more than this from trek  gt  i don t want trek of old  that d be boring  i want good trek back unfortunately we re no longer profitable as consumers  the cost of making something a bit risky and thought provoking is just too high for a show that puts over 8mil into an episode and has its uniform fabric dyed a custom shade of blue in switzerland  theres too much at stake to take risks 
0,you re assuming a lot insight from this group of writers 
0,i can t wait to see how they kill her character 
0,flesh out the rest of the bridge crew  we got a sub plot about one of them having a tough time mentally but that seemed to get dropped  it s been three seasons and i still don t know their names by memory
0,lower decks i like  discovery and picard i really don t like many criticisms  my latest being how  despite the low episode count  in both series it seems to take an absolute age for the main plot line to move on  the episodes are stuffed full of tangential  meandering subplots  which at the conclusion i m left wondering what was the point picard  for example  took  so long  to get a crew together and seemed to slowly visit a planet to get whatever small thing was required to move the plot along  same for discovery season 3 of discovery has been about finding the source of the burn  but 11 episodes have been spent on side shows   seed ship plot  adira is a trill subplot  something happening on brook s planet  waiting for algorithms to complete  stringing it out over multiple episodes only to interrupt it all with a mirror universe nonsense two parter  none of it seems to matter  so why devote entire episodes of a short season to it  the entire burn plot could have been done in a two parter if they d dispensed with the filler  but instead it s the whole season  so my latest gripe is basically that picard and discovery are actually padding out their short seasons with filler  because their season long archs aren t actually any more ambitious or interesting than a traditional series two parter 
0,if star trek taught us anything  you have to say  end program  2 3 times to make sure you re not still suck in the holodeck s holodeck 
0,i agree   and he was neither when he mentioned how long it would take him to reprogram the array 
0,yes  i guess that s so 
0,she ll be fine  they wouldn t dare kill her off  not because of her character mind you 
0,or get killed for zero good reason 
0,probably just a cameo  but it s also the view so take it with alot of salt  
0,in order to convey a sense of urgency vocally  one must be frustrated by the time constraints 
0,hang on a second   production begins next month on what is probably a highly serialised story  i e  a single story spread over multiple eps or the entire season like s1 was  and they haven t confirmed a major guest star for a multiple episode spot   so if she confirms then they would have to shoehorn her in to an existing story   after the main problem with s1 was that inconsistent pacing led to half the ending being cut for time let s just hope that interview was recorded months ago because otherwise it doesn t bode well for s2 
0,neither  i pick tuvok 
0,well  sir patrick steward  not jean luc picard  invented her to join the show in public   we all have seen this on youtubeso it is only a matter of time and episodes  when she appears 
0,i m sure they did have one  i just don t remember it  and that s unfortunate  but i m glad folks liked it
0,sisko did punch q  which is worthy of mentioning 
0,no  she s an el aurian
0,she doesn t embody term any longer   my dude  she is an actor  lol
0,i love spaces riddles  timescape and cause  amp  effect are some of my favourite episodes from tng  of course  there were explosions in those episodes  or rather the same explosion done multiple times   you have my vote for star trek  captain sherlock and commander watson  time detectives 
0,i mean the destiny was heading to another galaxy soooo   technically    i mean maaaybe technically it could work 
0,watch as it s a survivor analogue style gameshow with everyone wearing red shirts 
0, gt     and i ve heard that the writer s room for sn 1 was a mess too  so he doesn t sound like a great showrunner eitherok but he wasn t the showrunner during all that bryan fuller was the creator and the showrunner during early production of dsc  then  aaron harberts and gretchen berg took over until they got fired halfway through s2  that s when michelle paradise became dsc s showrunner and alex kurtzman was put in charge of tv side of the franchise  like a kevin feige type  overseer  role  amp  x200b  gt     it s telling that the best received recent trek show has been the one he had no involvement in   kurtzman is an executive producer on every star trek project including short treks  pic  ld  and upcoming stuff like snw  s31  pro   
0,happy birthday to both you  amp  one of my favourite star treks 
0,how  annoying  would it be if  every  time  the computer  asked  are you  shaw  you  want to  end the  program
0,i am perfectly okay with affectionate subtext  ds9 had plenty of characters with close relationships  chief julian and quark odo come to mind  but there was no unnecessary declaration of love  they show they care about one another the same way normal people show it  no√∂ne cries and declares love the same way that sonequa martin green is forced to  i feel terrible for her having to act that shit  lol 
0, gt   boring and mundane  is how i describe all my favorite things  i bet it would work wonders in the marketing department  well  really  what s the alternative  
0,cultural rommunism is destroying tradition ferengi values   1 
0,pretty sure you have to say it aloud 
0,  i enjoy disco  but wish i liked it more  the first season was good  though the end of the klingon war felt rushed and tacked on like they weren t certain they d get a second and wanted to tie everything up just in case season two started strong but absolutely fell apart half way through  and again copped out on the ending season three has been good   it doesn t have the high points of the other two  but also not the same low points as season two  it s also looking like they might stick the landing which is pretty exciting    picard  was a mess  i liked the premise they introduced  and i would have liked it a whole lot more of they did something more interesting with it  so much set up with such a bungled pay off  i do really like the characters they ve introduced though  keeping my hopes low for season two   ldecks is everything i wanted it to be  except way too few episodes  there was one episode which i thought was kind of a dud     terminal provocations     and the rest were bangers  i will grant that they can go a bit hard on the references to older trek  but i m here for it 
0,i could be wrong but i assume star trek strange new worlds will be more like this  when it comes out 
0,ds9 tied for best with tng  ds9 was better  but it couldn t be there without tng  and anyway  tng was my childhood  i cannot rank the two lol  after that tos  it is one of the best when it is really good  some of the writing is amazing  it definitely didn t age the best  but it is so often interesting with depth that i don t see too often especially outside of star trek  after that i have a soft spot for enterprise  it was really cancelled just as it was getting good  i really liked season 4  then voyager  i haven t gotten too far into it  but it just isn t my favourite  but i think the premise had potential  and i can kind of see why other people love it  then discovery  season 2 with anson mount as pike was quite decent  but i am really sick of the melodramatic acting then lower decks  i just didn t get much out of it  i laugh more in tng and original series funny episodes  i can see why people like it  but i doubt that i will ever rewatch  but i will definitely keep up to date on season 2  just to see where it goes  picard is dead last  i really  really want this to change  desperately i want to like it  but the shock killing of characters and the terrible writing made it impossible for me to finish the season  im planning to try again soon  but dear god it was just so awful  honestly don t remember enough about tas to rank  i watched most a really long time ago  but i remember liking it well enough  so ds9 tng  tos  ent  voy  dsc  ld  pic  not ranked is tas

0,i have been a life long beastie boys fan  i still rolled my eyes at this scene  he also didn t comment on the quality of the music at all   btw the beasties were famously big fans of star trek  another reason for their musics inclusion 
0,hopefully not  from how she acts on the view  she clearly doesn t embody trek any longer also picard season 1 was terrible  please just cancel it 
0,honestly you do not do such a thing if it has not been decided  unless she demanded way more than they were willing to pay  she will be in ifonlyfor a cameo appearance 
0,okay    and why exactly did the screen instructions need to curse like a sailor on a pg 13 movie 
0, gt  uh  such as  i ve addressed your points  several times   what do you want proof of  exactly you seem to have forgotten you were saying you addressed the federation values vs riker telling troi otherwise without giving proof lol  gt  dude  it s two different situations  i don t know how many times i need to say being dead isn t the same as being asleep i didn t say it was the same thing  i said there were similarities lol  the major one being saying the dead don t deserve life and saying the asleep don t deserve consciousness are both illogical lol  gt  riker was talking about a utilitarian decision in an emergency to save lives  not murdering an innocent man to resurrect people like killing holo laforge isn t murdering him but a utilitarian decision  riiiight lol  gt  when the emergency has already ended tuvok and neelix were still dead  sounds like the emergency was still in full swing lol  gt  surely you must realise these aren t comparable  right like denying someone consciousness and denying someone life is totally not comparable at all  riiiiight lol  gt  we re talking about federation values  not what you or i think are the right thing what do you think i was saying with riker and troi  lol gt   which is subjective and up for debate  so whether stealing vs not stealing is the right thing is subjective and up for debate  riiight lol  gt  however while we re on this  i think janeway did the wrong thing  so yes  i d follow picard so just becuase you disagree with janeway you d do whatever picard does  you d shoot up ensign lynch so that he looks like swiss cheese just because you disagree with janeway  lol gt  perhaps you would disagree and you think she did the right thing  but that s a separate debate  whether janeway did the right thing in killing tuvix is the core of the debate  unless you think we re arguing about troi and riker  lol gt  again  totally different situation  they were being attacked  it s not comparable to the thing with tuvix  i was talking about picard s values since you brought it up  not tuvix lol  keep up lol  you seem to not want to talk about tuvix anyway since you said this isn t about tuvix  so i think you d welcome talking about picard lol  gt  if your entire argument that her actions are in line with federation values hinges on this conversation between riker and troiyou re the one who brought up federation values not me lol  keep up lol  gt  the meaning of which you ve misinterpreted  then i think you need to go back and rewatch both that tng episode and the tuvix ep  listen carefully to what riker is saying and then rewatch tuvix and see how what janeway did was completely different again  proof  blustery claims about how something is wrong isn t proof lol 
0,i m for ending a lot of programs but not reddit
0,to refine it further    star trek is trying to be something else  star trek used to be what was imitated  and now in desperation to get billion returns to the franchise  it s marvelising itself  lead by a guy who understands neither trek nor the marvel universe  people always say  trek needs to be modernised don t you dare criticise kurtzman and co   but what they are basically doing is shitting down conversations about whether it s really being modernised in the right way  or with all the violence and moral relativism is it not selling out what is actually at the core of what originally makes trek so captivating in the first place  it s not all bad  picard had some beautiful ideas  and discovery has the foresight to get out of its prequel rut  and ld is refreshingly visually authentic  i just want it to be more meaningful  better paced  return to a more naval grace in spaceflight  more stolid camera work  have more confidence in itself rather than  look at me    oooh aren t i meaningful   oooh aren t i exciting  relentless drive that just ultimately underwhelms  i don t want trek of old  that d be boring  i want good trek back

0,i will turn out she is like the q but of a species that seperated themselves a long time ago and are called the v  she will turn out to be the main villian of the season and has to be defeated by asking the douwd from tng season 3 episode 3 to wipe the q and v from existence 
0, i m not angry jean luc  i m just dissapointed 
0,yeah  i have no idea what they were thinking   it goes along with the style of the klingons   i don t know what they were thinking 
0,that may be true  but when they are so ubiquitous that many people notice them  to the point of distraction  that s a problem   the older movies didn t have that issue 
0, gt  fundamentally  star trek is a philosophical aesop s fables in a futuristic hornblower  western saga square peg  being pushed into a marvel got round hole by alex kurtzman  thats    not a bad way of describing it  i m not keeping up with disco on weekly releases anymore since i found i wasn t excited at all and was just going through the motions  i ll binge watch it sometime down the line when i m bored  mostly with disco i find i m not seeing anything i haven t seen before  its a bit   bland 
0,he s got so many other episodes where he also really shines  nog and quark were both favorites of mine 
0,maybe i ll give season 3 a try  i could probably read the synopsis of season 2 on wiki and then watch the last episode before starting season 3 ld is silly  so don t expect more than a diet coke   version of rick and morty  that said  it follows canon and i thought it was fun to watch

0,going from memory  transporters deconstruct a person or object atom by atom  then saved as a pattern of data which holds the blueprint on where all these atoms go  that data is then stored in the pattern buffer and then sent to a new location where the data in the buffer is reassembled  atom by atom  back into their original positions  this ends up with an exact duplication of the object as it was at the time it was disassembled regarding our conciousness remaining intact during this process  we exist within a reality made up of atoms  this process is more involved than say a brain transplant from one body to another     but it is our brains that holds our conciousness  in theory  if you froze yourself at this very moment  pressed the pause button  and then took your brain  body and everything else  deconstructed it as it is at this very moment  and then did all of the above to relocate and assemble elsewhere     everything in your brain  the blood  electrodes  etc  would be put right back in their exact place  and then you re un paused from your perspective  you wouldn t have noticed any of this happening  if you were frozen   paused at the time for deconstruction  and the only thing you d realise is that your surroundings just changed your conciousness should be right there along with your body when it s all said and done personally  i don t believe the transporting in star trek would have people still moving and talking as they re beamed away like what you see in some episodes or movies  but perhaps the transporters are advanced enough to do all this without having to lock someone or something in place for disassembly       but if they did lock someone in place  maybe spock s mom might not have died in the first jj movie by falling to her death and chekhov losing the pattern lock      which also doesn t really explain how at other times  someone was saved from falling via transport     let s just forget the jj stuff 
0,1  	space expands and contracts as the plot requires  earth to vulcan in 2 minutes  vulcan to laurentian system takes long enough for kirk to get into a spat with spock  get summarily shot off the ship  tf    and crashland within kilometers of old spock and scotty on a planet that can t be more than a lightsecond away from vulcan  star trek s always had issues with distance  but this took the cake 	time does the same  with the narada showing up  killing george kirk  then disappearing for twenty five years to wait for spock to catch up before laying into vulcan  sure  there s a deleted scene that covers the gap   somewhat and makes no sense   but scenes cut from a movie don t count as part of the movie 	careers do the same as well  a trouble cadet can now command a fresh off the line starship and be responsible for the lives of a thousand crewmembers   somehow none of whom apparently outrank him   and the scary arsenal that comes with it 	light    well  you get the point  	it was a fun ride  but you really couldn t be too emotionally invested in the wheels to enjoy  amp  x200b 2 	this is where fanservice took on cynicism inducing proportions 	introduces us to the true universe breaking extent of transwarp beaming  something that according to prime spock prime scott invented as well  we can now transport directly from earth to qo nos    so  admiral marcus    why send the enterprise  you have the transwarp beaming thingie  if it s broken  you ve got scotty  he can fix it  or make another one  and you can beam your strike team  or torpedoes  directly to harrison s location  no  rule of cool requires we blow up super secret section 31 to the point where it s hiding a massive monstershipbuilding facility right inside the federation s capitol system  cause we have to somehow get to the freaky friday deathscene  and then kill stakes forever by fixing death itself  oh  alright  well  at least we got to see doctor marcus in her knickers  that was certainly universe building  amp  x200b 3 	i actually liked this one  though it s been a while and the plot as i recall it was rather contrived  former maco turned space vampire sits inside a nebula waiting for a hundred years for one very specific and unique piece of technology to roll up onto his doorstep for him to attack the federation with  could ve just used the mining drones  my dude  they seemed to have no trouble with the enterprise  imagine how effective they would ve been against ships a hundred years ago  what was the point of that 	people lay into the beasty boys track being used to jam communications between the drones  eh  a solid tone or white noise would ve done the trick as well  probably  but who ever said you can t have just a little fun while you re saving the day

0,that was a very non specific  will you come on our show whoopi   though so yes it was  announced  but there s still a reason  for those who care about such things  to follow the news and see if she actually ends up on set and in an episode this season 
0,it wasn t that bad come to think of it  i watched it twice during the charismas holidays and many times in the past

0,no but damn i see it now
0,not rubber science at all  it wasn t very long ago  real scientists made a basic teleporter work  transporting one atom 3m from its original location with 100  accuracy back in 2014 and in 2015  german scientists made a system that destruct an inanimate object layer by layer and can reassemble it anywhere in the world via a 3d printer the thing about star trek is that many of the things they made up to cover budget or to keep the plot running along are things that influenced a lot of the things we take for granted today and people decided to try and make them a reality scientists are even saying ftl  warp travel  is also possible without breaking the rules of real world physics

0,i was 11 when i saw trek 09 in the cinema  and it was the first trek movie i ever went to so for me as a sugar addled schoolboy who just wanted to see massive shiny things  and lots and lots of explosions  i still get a kick out of it  spaceships go pew pew pew but the first two films massively dialled up the power level to the point of madness  with scotty beaming people wherever he damn well pleases  phaser turrets that  admittedly with help from a black hole  shredded a 24th century borg enhanced mining ship  cracking transwarp drive in the mid 23 hundreds which allowed travel to kronos in hours  you get the idea this works on a visceral level  but as soon as you think about it  it seems utterly insane  and how the hell did scotty beam himself into a reactor tank anyway they tried to explore this in into darkness  with section 31 gearing up for armed conflict with the klingons  and trying to militarize the federation even further  but the film was saddled with a khan plot that i thought distracted from the actual story it wanted to tell  about a post 9 11  war on terror era federation struggling with it s own military industrial complex and i ve still got very little to meaningfully say about beyond  despite seeing it 6 times sulu has a husband  that s nice  we finally get actual away team action  cool  idris elba is pissed that starfleet left him behind after the romulan war  i think  what was idris elba s problem actually  we also get to trash the enterprise  for the fourth time in as many films  but it s all good because we also replace it straight after speaking of that  what s with the need for little of consequence to carry over first kirk dies and gets revived half an hour later  then the enterprise blows up and we replace it in the same film the only thing that seems to have stuck is the destruction of vulcan  which didn t even result in a shift in young spock s trajectory  because old spock stepped in to care for the survivors and keep young spock on the enterprise 
0,when watching ds9 i spend every episode wishing garak was part of the main cast  but then realizing maybe part of what makes him so great is that we only get him in small doses   it always leaves us wanting more garak and we never get tired of his antics as a result 
0,do you have a clip of what you re talking about   did you see it on netflix   there s a rather well known scene with the kazon from early on  where a bunch of them had these weird fanfares added in as they were introduced  only in the netflix version 
0, but later    
0,gotta get that shaft of light on shatner s face
0,which is so weird to me  occasionally they ll have a  talking  scene  and sometimes it invokes a table   but they feel the need to inject some excitement into it with the characters acting really emotional  or some dramatic camera movements  plenty of other modern shows have scenes where characters are just sitting and talking  it doesn t have to be inherently boring  and actually  there were several scenes in the most recent episode of discovery that just involved sitting and talking  it made me think  hmm  this is refreshing  
0,it s real 
0,i mean best of both worlds was great  the borg itself lets  sorry if wrong written  it down for me 
0,i would totally watch a  cheers  style spinoff set around guinan  morn  garak  amp  a few other retired career officers hanging out in a futuristic bay area supercity bar talking shit about what the federation has been up to the past 20 years 
0,can t really think of much more epic than literally exploring the galaxy 
0,well just to be fair  they did have a story   unfortunately it was tied to the main plot in an really hackneyed way that pushed the limits of believability  like   really   they had a kid who died because the federation outlawed androids 
0, points fingers like jack sparrow only menacingly 
0,there are a few things about this movie that i m not crazy about  uniforms  klaxons  excessive spielberging  but i ll always love it for the beautiful enterprise  imo  the best exterior of all  i was pleased to see that the se addressed quite a few of my complaints  anyone who hasn t seen it should for the record  i saw this in a tiny but packed theater on opening night 
0,why not start with ds9  i did it with my wife and it became a great success  it has a lot of humor  interesting characters  tensions  crime  real meanings to think about as an adult  space battles  a lot of gray tones instead of simple black and white 
0,season 3 is much better if you feel like giving disco a chance again  i d even say you can skip season 2 and not miss a huge amount  other than the events in season 2 setting up the basic premise of season 3 they re never mentioned in any specific details 
0,i just want some people to chat without shouting or whispering or crying or showing any love for each other outside of a casually friendly workplace friendliness 
0,what i think you and trek fans are craving is a more oxytocin laden  competence porn portrayal of upstanding starfleet officers working through problems together  rather than adrenaline fuelled compromised characters murdering their way through a plot 
0,i guess by today s standards  long scenes around a conference table in which they discuss exactly what the issue is carefully is seen as dull
0,fundamentally  star trek is a philosophical aesop s fables in a futuristic hornblower  western saga square peg  being pushed into a marvel got round hole by alex kurtzman  it s all worth watching  but also worth criticising  a notable 2 parter aside  discovery s3 has landed in a balance that s quite entertaining if forgettable  after an atrocious s1 and a nostalgia laden s2  picard has a plurality of borderline genius ideas and narrative tangents that seem i allowed to be explored in any depth  s2 could really be something if it s allowed to drift into what s good  ld is faithful  fun  forgettable again 
0,very good  i enjoyed the mcfadden stewart blooper thrown in there
0,he also provoked spock into punching him in the face  which makes me question why spock was in command your commanding officer just lost his entire planet including his mother  and in a fit of rage beat the hell out of the xo and stranded him on a planet kirk needed to be  for being a prick  but that outburst should have seem spock  not long after  and in the end spock did hand command over  to kirk after kirk managed to beam off a planet onto a ship at warp 
0,please cast michael dorn in a leading role   
0,the visitor is absolutely amazing of course  but my first time watching it i was confused because i irrationally expected  the visitor  to refer to nana visitor 
0,im gona need you to expand on   all of that 
0,sisko was a builder  not a soldier  perhaps the latter reluctantly  but it s not who he was deep down  he did not seek out war or combat like worf per michael piller  gt   it was harder to define sisko as a character than perhaps any of the others  and ultimately it took us probably a season and a half to reach the conclusion that sisko was a builder  a man who built things  stayed with projects  as opposed to the driver  the captain of a starship who went off and moved from place to place   source  
0,i felt the same about discovery  but stopped watching after the 1st season  just not fun to watch i love lower decks  though i live outside na and found alternative ways of watching it  how you get to watch it soon  it s fun 
0,i actually really like this idea  thanks 
0,actually yes  i ve tried a few advanced papercraft models  but they turn out a bit too flimsy to be decent decor memorabilia 
0, destiny  sounds like a 4th kelvin universe film
0,i always thought that him meeting her in orb experiences visions  as he did  would qualify 
0,why not both  seriously  both sound great  bring q in too for some sweet hand waving interaction with guinan
0,i hated disco seasons 1  amp  2  i gave up after 2 seasons  i came back for the third season after many reports that it improved  and it has  it s still not great  but has improved a lot picard is wonderful  i recognize it s flaws  but i appreciate the slower  existential look at a beloved character later in life  and to me  star trek needs to comment on the times in which it airs  and thus  star trek changes with time  with that in mind  i appreciated the  darker   i hate that term  mind you  elements about the state of the galaxy and the federation  i only hope they begin the repair of it soon  it has a lot of ideas about what to say about our current world lower decks is fun and i ll always take more
0, he doesn t have the lobes  
0,very enjoyable movies  and ofcourse the first one was best  trek might have died a slow death without these 
0,discovery is great  i love it  it gives me what i want from trek  i have few complaints  picard was fun but missable for me  lower decks is  amazing   god  i fucking adore it  one of my top top shows right now 
0,yeah but that s less money they can make
0,the heist episode was also pretty solid
0,i like both  but peck takes the cake  that s less about the actors and more about the direction they went with the characters  i m happy neither of them just tried to do a nimoy impression though 
0,here s the clip 
0,s1 seemed darker than the other seasons  and i liked that 
0, worf fears the sisko  
0, boring and mundane  is how i describe all my favorite things  i bet it would work wonders in the marketing department  i don t think there s ever been an episode of star trek ever that was designed to be boring and mundane  so it would definitely be boldly going from a production standpoint 
0,i m looking forward to it when it comes to the uk  it s just a shame that tng style stories are seen as only fit for comedic or younger audiences  but from what i understand it s a blast 
0,its uncomfortable how a federation of planets military ships and admirals are all staffed by humans dont give me the paramount didnt have budget for alien make up excuse either
0,have you checked out  lower decks   it s kaboom y too  but with an entirely different feel than other recent efforts 
0,sounds perfect for lower decks 
0,i just typed a way to long essay about dsc characters as a response to this  it amounted to a really long and repetitive ramble that boiled down to  characters good  so i ll just say i really love the characters on dsc  and they carry the show for me  it s become one of my favorites  characters good 
0,she did get a number of other episodes  such as faces  which i loved  and i think in that episode it is clear that even though she will face her problems again  she will never entirely resolve them  gt  i ll spend the rest of my life fighting with her 
0,discovery  just can t get into it  it s too  different  it doesn t feel right to me picard  i think had a lot of potential  some episodes it really hits well  some i don t like a lot  i m disappointed in what they ve ended up doing with picard  he doesn t feel like picard  but i enjoy it for the most part lower decks    i absolutely adore it  it s lighthearted  fun  it appeals to people that don t watch star trek but also recognizes the facets of star trek that even fans think are silly  and it embraces it  can t wait for next season

0,what is annoying to me apart from what you so eloquelntly put  is also the way burnham is directed  she is an emotional wreck  are we supposed to feel that this makes her more human and thus elicit our sympathy   always on the verge of  not a breakdown but close  her emotional responses to everything are needlessly over the top and on me it has a peter cried wolf effect   what  she is crying  again  oh come on   and  too much needless whispering i dont like that the show so far revolves around her like stories with chosen ones etc  although i dont mind the rest of the show   and i love saru s story arc  like you do  i find it annoying at times and kind of not very star treky but i find it annoying the same way i am sometimes annoyed by people i love   amp  x200b ps    ok  terra burnham was hilarious  it was so overacted  very b movie villain  she was so bad she was good 
0,this is ceti alpha fiiivvvvee 
0,discovery is fine  too reliant on drama and imo not exactly interested in what star trek is about  but it s okay  mostly  would enjoy more if not connected to the star trek name picard is embarrassingly bad  both as a tv show in general and as a star trek show in particular  poorly written  unimaginative  dark and gritty because that s what  cool  shows do now  it s awful i can t see lower decks in europe yet 
0,the fact is that people like this exist in real life so why exclude them neelix does go on a journey throughout the series  and that is more than can be said of some of the other characters  kim and chakotay were both pretty unwavering   even though i m not sure it was intentional  that someone who has been through one of the worst traumas of the entire crew  he is the one that is most outgoing and gregarious  as to try and hide his pain  and also protect others from what he went through  naomi in particular  
0,lower decks is ok  it s entertaining but not really laugh out loud funny  by far the best of new trek discovery has lots of problems and some plus points  each season has started strongly  got a little lost around the middle and then completely messed up the ending  i m expecting the exact same next week with the finale when    well i won t say it as it s a spoiler   shows up to save the day  then there ll be a speech picard   the absolute worst  everyone involved should be embarrassed for what they did with the character  if the show was called smith and was about a retired future spaceman and not tied to trek  and tbh they shoehorn in all the old trek stuff and none of it matters in the end  nobody would watch it and it would be slated  terrible performances  terrible story  i m amazed they re doing another season 
0,i have a bunch of issues with discovery  specially about their lack of lore knowledge and focus on michael always saving the day  i personally enjoyed picard as an emotional journey  nepenthe made me cry because i ve been watching tng since 1988 as a kid  when riker  troi and picard embraced  you feel that sirtis  frakes and patrick embraced each other and were genuinely touched by their on screen reunion  lower decks is more star trek than discovery 
0,i damn well hope so she was amazing in tng

0,none of these are doing what imo makes st great    seized to get a wide range of characters who were able to be mixed and match to highlight a wide arrange of moral dilemmas  personal conflicts  or analysis of social and cultural norms   now we get a 10 hour long film with explosions and let we flare or an annoying cartoon designed where all the characters act like they are on coke

0,i grew up watching tos  mostly after school reruns on a 9 inch b amp w tv and in color when the living room tv was available  tos held up well  and you could tell while shot in color  they put some thought to the fact it was also going to be viewed in b amp w also  it was just enjoyable remembering it back then regardless if it was in color or not 
0,i was thinking a twilight zone style anthology that shows various times and events of star trek history with  carl  taking the place of rod serling 
0,ethan peck is so much better  he has the mannerisms down without parody  and he s perfect for a younger more emotional spock who s closer to the cage then the menagerie 
0, gt  a lot of writers these days are structuring their scripts like a  5 year old tells a story   and then  he   and then  she   and  then     and then   and then     and absolutely nothing beyond the  superficial list of things the character did  to be fair  that was the exact problem back with voyager in later seasons  there was no real structure beyond throwing out random events just for the sake of it  characters never got the chance to develop over seven seasons either  with the exception of emh and seven 
0,yeaaaaaaaaaaaah
0,throw in a bunch of csi references and actor cameos and i m sold 
0,discovery had pretty bad first two seasons  too mich action  death  violence  forgettable characters  followed by a rather good 3rd one  picard was bad and destroyed so much of established trek history and lower decks is funny and enjoyable if you don t take it too seriously and accept it for what it is  a silly comedy show that is very meta from time to time and more of a parody than something to be taken seriously

0,fair points   but the line between  normal  obsession and an obsessive disorder is a fuzzy one that s hard to quantify   clearly  despite that focus  he also went on to be a successful starfleet officer and captain who has twice been awarded the medal for valor   if it s not significantly hindering his professional life  and we know nothing about his personal life to judge if it s had an impact there  it s hard to say that there s something truly unhealthy about his behavior i mean  i ve written probably the equivalent of 2 dozen papers discussing star trek and star wars on reddit over the years  we re doing so now   d   have a wars tattoo and plan to get a trek one  and can tell you how to play an entirely fictional game like sabacc   but that doesn t mean that my interest in these universes qualifies as a psychological disorder  or that i can t focus on other tasks because i can t get the stars out of my head   they re just my primary fandoms  and it s pretty normal for humans to have fandoms that they are strongly interested in   for solok  i didn t even have to look up his name    vulcan superiority  could be his equivalent interest   something he s spent a fair amount of time on  but doesn t impair his ability to carry out other tasks or live a normal life i m not saying you re wrong  i m just not convinced that you re right

0,transporters aren t shown consistently  like any trek technology  but generally the way  they presented shows they   do not   upload passengers  they re not scanner 3d printers  they work by converting matter into a form of exotic energy that exists coherently in subspace  they then transmit that specific  matter stream  that is captured and converted back into regular matter on arrival  we can say this with some confidence because we have multiple examples of the transporters working this way   people being able to see into subspace during transport  reg barclay sees what he thinks are aliens  and later turn out to be stranded crew whose matter streams were lost  enterprise had an episode all about exploring a region of space to find someone who had been transported and was lost in subspace   there are multiple episodes where transporter chiefs  lose the pattern  and despite their best efforts the person is lost for good  if they were simply scanned and turned into data the data could be resent   both in tng and voyager the transporter was used to store people  but this was dangerous because if kept for too long their bodies began to break down  if they were just data sitting on a hard drive that makes no sense  but if their bodies are currently sat in subspace it does obviously there are exceptions  like the infamous tom riker  but those are the minority and typically are due to some aberrant anomaly

0,  discovery    season one was overall  ok   had some good moments  but the dark gritty tone and the dialogue that had characters constantly sniping at each other was thoroughly unsatisfying  season two was an improvement  though like the first season it suffered from being overly focused on action and the pacing was inconsistent  season three has been very good  it s not perfect but the show has absolutely come into it s own   picard    started out ok  ended atrociously    lower decks    i ll let you know once people outside na are allowed to watch it
0, i dig discovery  it s not  fantastic  but season 3 has definitely made it more interesting  it s ok  i want to see what the klingons look like noooowwww  i love picard  i have minor quibbles  sure  but i can imagine sir pat looking at what they did with charles xavier and wanting to have the same type of grumpy old man fun with picard  where was geordi and worf   i thought it was great  everything except brent spiner s makeup hahaha     haven t seen lower decks  but i m curious

0,the screwdriver only appeared in dr who a few months ahead of assignment earth  but dr who had been on the air for five years before this episode  plenty of time for roddenberry to be inspired 
0,peripherally   there are a few episodes that strongly imply that consciousness is a separate thing   think it was  neural energy  which was a separate  distinct thing   sort of a body soul distinction   in particular  the  our man bashir  said it wasn t super difficult to store their physical bodies  but the neural energy or whatever took so much more space  and the implication seemed to kind of be you needed both   or at least  the  consciousness  was a special thing that was a lot more complicated than just cloning someone s body well  to be fair   search for spock  is all about vulcans having a soul  so i guess it s more than peripheral  hah hah i don t think they ve really thought through the rules and philosophical implications  and some stuff contradicts itself  but in general  trek  seems to adhere to a body   separate consciousness   both need to be transported idea 
0,that s okay  it isn t for everyone  hell star trek isn t for everyone so lwaxana certainly isn t  weird thing  over time i ve developed this theory that picard didn t actually find lwaxana annoying  but that she actually scared the daylights out of him  think about it  an age appropriate empath that could probably make him happy in ways he s never been  lwaxana is a powerful empath  if picard simply hated her and found her annoying she d have packed up her shit and gone home the first time they met but i think if she d sensed that he was just afraid  nervous  and vulnerable in his own way  then she might have kept at it for a good long while  this powerful empath kept at it for a good long while  so   i think she scares the daylights out of him  picard has never been happy or content  and is genuinely afraid of what that might be like 
0,just bangs in the holodeck all day
0,getting from there to here   
0,the percentage that s generated from rotten tomatoes is really flawed though  for a lot of reasons 
0,two of my friends point out they already went through this when tng came out  one of them insists tng never really got as good as tos  but he is loving discovery  trek is better than no trek funny enough  he will not watch lower decks  but i love it season 3 of discovery is the new unexplored area of star trek  it now has the same opportunity as tng to build on what has come before  i agree that it feels different than 90s trek  but it s still trying to find it s voice  it s close 
0,in hindsight  i don t think hayes is bad  having picard  the face of the enemy at 359  in the fleet would be distracting and could be deleterious to morale and discipline  consider how sisko reacted to him  especially if picard gave orders that didn t immediately make sense alternatively  if the fleet did have confidence in him but the borg prioritized the enterprise as a target because it was familiar  it could be devastating to morale  imagine if they even re assimilated picard  it d be a fucking nightmare to the fleet if it wasn t going well because it could start to seem like wolf 359 all over again later on  picard does clearly have unresolved issues in facing the borg so if hayes went out there with  say  150 ships making the enterprise s armament a marginal difference to his total fleet strength  the complexity of picard s involvement would be an illogical risk to take also  picard telling him straight off the bat that he knew the borg had come back  because he had some weird psychic connection to them and had started having dreams where he heard their voices  probably didn t help his case at all

0, gt i don t see any signs of psychological problemsthe dude wrote short of 2 dozen papers on vulcan superiority  talked about a wrestling match he had one time with sisko  and 20 years later is so obsessed with him that he got a group together to master an ancient  dead game no one gives a shit about in hopes of making someone feel bad  my gut tells me the vulcan version of the dsm has a valid label for that 
0,shame they could have tied her and tom parris actor to tng  parris actor played a cadet in a previous episode as another character at starfleet academy
0,i haven t read it yet  but it sounds good and i ve heard it called the best trek novelization more than once 
0,i don t see any signs of psychological problems  and it s tricky trying to diagnose a member of a different species   simply a strong sense of racial superiority   as for the crew mastering the game  well  if the captain has a thing for the game for whatever reason  it s only logical to learn it yourself and thus get on his good side 
0,coincidence 
0,i like the movie  but i have a few dislikes about it   i think they spent too much time just gawking at the special effects  the transporter death was just kinda there and added nothing and everyone just forgot about it a minute later  ilia s  i m celibate because you re all sexually immature  lines just hang in the air without explanation  i know there is an explanation but it s silly  the story i liked  kirk struggling to not be a jerk to decker i liked  disco mountain man mccoy i loved  i also liked that it was a star trek movie that doesn t rely on a giant space battle  i like giant space battles  but i also need variety in my trek 
0,i m one of those fans that s in the middle when it comes to tmp  i don t think it s as bad some people say but i also don t think it s great as some others say  i think it is a fairly average star trek film that has some cool moments and but also issues  i think it s kinda lame that they never even acknowledge it s existence in later films  i thought it was way better than star trek v 
0,why isn t admiral patrick on the list  gt that s a stupid question 
0,mmmmm  there are a few i disagree with  but the one who stands out if haftel  he s starts out as a badmiral by ordering lal taken back to starfleet  but by the end of the episode  he s completely changed  personal growth should preclude him from badmiral status nachayev is like og badmiral  maybe she wasn t a 100  badmiral in tng  but she definitely earned the title in ds9 admiral ross is a tough one for me to judge  because i could go either way  in the section 31 episodes i saw him more as a victim of blackmail and he just kind of went along to get along  he s clearly morally compromised  but i m not sure if i d give him full badmiral status 
0,definitely liked picard overall  but that s probably also a bit like saying i like discovery overall   there are certainly aspects of disco which leave a bit flat  and picard wasn t a home run  but overall i enjoyed it and am looking forward to season 2 
0,fair enough  we don t know much about the individual crew except that they re apparently willing to work under a captain with  imo  obvious psychological problems when starfleet would surely transfer them out if they requested it and weren t disruptive pos themselves  and that they mastered an obscure  dead  human game with uncomplicated rules in hopes of one day sticking it to a random guy they ve nothing to do with and have never met  that all just seems weird to me  it was a good episode otherwise 
0,i think the main criticism is just the poor writing in general   there are definitely good things about the show  but the basics of storytelling are fundamental 
0,oh  god this is so good  thank you 
0,this right fucking here   i love disco but i ve never been more pissed off at a character decision on the show than burnham in that moment 
0,i m glad it appealed to some folks haha there s a trek for everyone  i assume you liked picard overall  i think i did too  it was just little things here and there lol but i m still here for it  discovery hasn t really caught my interest so i ve come to appreciate the idea of having 3 series going at once to enjoy

0,i expect guinan s spot will either be highly picard centric in terms of his new  android  form and the nature of existence etc   which means rather introspective and potentially of questionable merit apart from character development but more likely fan service   or it ll relate more to her being of extraordinary years and knowledge and connectedness with the universe  in which case it could speak to her being a cog in the larger plot line with some galactic or universal threat 
0, gt 	without giving proof uh  such as  i ve addressed your points  several times   what do you want proof of  exactly  gt again  what makes the dead less deserving of life than the living  that s like saying the sleeping are less deserving of consciousness than the awake lol dude  it s two different situations  i don t know how many times i need to say being dead isn t the same as being asleep  riker was talking about a utilitarian decision in an emergency to save lives  not murdering an innocent man to resurrect people when the emergency has already ended  surely you must realise these aren t comparable   gt 	so you d rather follow picard than do the right thing  we re talking about federation values  not what you or i think are the right thing  which is subjective and up for debate   however while we re on this  i think janeway did the wrong thing  so yes  i d follow picard  perhaps you would disagree and you think she did the right thing  but that s a separate debate   gt 	picard shot ensign lynch so many times that he must have looked like swiss cheese  you want to do the same because most fans agree picard best embodies the values of the federation out of any other character again  totally different situation  they were being attacked  it s not comparable to the thing with tuvix   gt 	again  did you hear what riker said to troi in her command test if your entire argument that her actions are in line with federation values hinges on this conversation between riker and troi  the meaning of which you ve misinterpreted  then i think you need to go back and rewatch both that tng episode and the tuvix ep  listen carefully to what riker is saying and then rewatch tuvix and see how what janeway did was completely different

0,maube this comment is off topic     i just wish transporters hadnt somehow weaseled their way into being star trek canon  they were a clever workaround in the beginning  to avoid having to spend the money to show shuttles zipping around all the time  but i like shuttles  and they re affordable to include now  it would be a better show if it were as realistic as possible  without a the rubber science 
0,i ve watched every episode of every series  a few times over for some of them  i liked discovery when it first started but as i watched more old episodes of ds9 and enterprise i started to really miss the old star trek  discovery s3 kind of blows for me  an ensign as first officer  the dialogue feeling at times more like some hbo friends in la type of show vs starfleet officers  anyway i kind of just wish they made a show that felt more like the old shows but i guess they didn t rate so well and so here we are  i ll take it though as some star trek is better than none  glad the franchise is still alive and i always have my reruns

0,i hope they give her an actual role rather than the pure filler episode sirtis and frakes got    give us a story to care about  quit it with the fan service
0,i m in complete agreement with absolutely everything you posted here  even though data is a machine  he s so much more  as captain picard pointed out and rightly so  data has met 2 of the criteria of sentient life    awareness   and   the right to choose    because of this  the courts ruled in picard s favor and  in doing so saved data fortunately i absolutely love this episode and it so happens to be one of my favorite episodes within the entire series  especially since it deals with the rights of the individual and how we perceive that individual as a whole 
0,in fairness  we know absolutely nothing about the attitudes of most of the crew regarding non vulcans  only the attitude of the captain   and some degree of vulcan chauvinism is pretty common  so it s probably tough for starfleet to cut out most of it   so long as he doesn t cross certain lines  it s probably tolerated mostly for political purposes to keep vulcans   happy    satisfied    pay close attention to his wording  and you ll find that most of the jabs are veiled insults rather than open ones  allowing him a fair degree of deniability should anyone complain

0,the movies are fine   ok  now   but not when they came out most criticisms that still hold today are generic things about reboots  film criticism  action over substance  etc  even though most star trek movies are less  deep  than episodes at the time  the biggest issue was rebooting it while claiming that it wasn t  or avoiding the issue altogether  they were telling us it s star trek but it s obviously not the look and characters we know luckily the explanations that came after about an alternate timeline do make sense and seem to fit  almost  exactly what we were provided on screen  so maybe it was always planned respectfully enough  but they chose to lie or be evasive instead of just say this from the beginning  which would have easily kept the fan base together  enough  there s even a scene from either the first or second movie that shows the original enterprise hanging over i think an admiral s desk  which would have made even clearer how the timeline changed with the arrival of the narada  but yet again  some smart guy decided those two seconds weren t worth it and cut it out the final movie  you can find the clip on youtube though so now that everything s out and clear  there s no problem with whether or not it s canon and stuff  sadly  it apparently set a precedent for how you can attract a new audience while not caring about or even lying to the old fans  and kurtzman jumped on that for discovery and picard  unashamedly lying it s the real  prime timeline star trek  or even directly saying in interviews he didn t like star trek as we knew it and wants to make it his thing   though the old knowledgeable fans can tell just from watching it that s the only reason i still see the jj movies as a bad and tragic thing in the history of star trek  because it started all this  but in themselves  we can accept them into the star trek universe we know and love just fine  the kelvin timeline

0,the opposite  in a way  part of the show s operating budget came from rca in an effort to push color tv  about a decade old at that time  and by no means ubiquitous   part of the reason the color in tos might seem garish is because the early color sets didn t display color as well as they do now  so they had to really juice them so people with color tv s felt they were seeing something worthwhile  i suppose i understand people who don t like the very in your face coloration of tos  i ve been watching it 40  years  and i think it s gorgeous

0,neelix as ferengi is the worst part of this episode    because   he had no experience with them  he just fit the  guy who would do this sort of thing   role    in the premiere it was paris who got kim away from quark  he should ve been the ferengi 
0,holy moley  that is very much  not  what that episode is about the romulan commander doesn t want to fight  and kirk doesn t want to either  both are compelled into conflict by your  if we don t escalate now they will kill us later  argument  as well as a ignorant distrust of the other  which is proves to a tragic and wasteful attitude  costing lives on both sides and with nothing gained for either the moral of the story is the  exact opposite  of you are proposing sometimes i wonder how some fans can miss the point of star trek so completely 
0,personally  i would love for it to be the doctor  however  as others have mentioned through over reddit threads  it would not allowing the show to stand on its own  the same would go for a new dax trill symbiont host combination  personally  it would make the most sense if the president someone who had crossed over from a distant parralel time line named g kar  he seems to be an appropriate fit at this point and he could definitely subdue the centric burnam monologues  that i hate and love  
0,i have one question for you tho  why would such a small coalition need rules to break the prime directive  the federation does that because they are huge  the coalition should build up for 10  20  maybe even 30 years if they want to go bootleg cooler federation  and do not even get me started on time travel
0,i entered this thread to post this but you beat me to it 
0,why didn t they just beam over a few torpedos and rig it to auto destruct once they were clear 
0,that would be a solid lower decks episode 
0,well  in sto it is not really a real supernova  and in the picard prequel book that i cannot remember the name of  they state that it was unnatural and generally weird too  so 31 should be able to get away with it
0,y all have rent  just be happy with that 
0,it s where he takes nog aside reminding him of the ugly side of humanity that comes out when they re deprived of their comfortable lifestyle  he says it under the backdrop of a unit of starfleet officers who have been trapped at an outpost for months during the dominion war 
0,good movies are when you don t have battle scenes  and the less battles scenes you have  the gooder your film is
0,this would make a great mini series star trek  asipiring scammer pulls a riker and gets surgically altered to look like the natives of a human esque pre warp world   he infiltrates the society and becomes king of the world and is found out by starfleet   they send in a ship to strategize how to get him out with minimal interference with the prewarp world   it could be done as a seth rogan comedy set in the star trek universe 
0,the magnificent ferangi is one of my favorite episodes  although  garak is probably the best actor on the show 
0,the sisko anchored ds9 at the beginning  overall as the show progressed  it became a strong ensemble show with both notable layers and players  this includes the whit of garek and the beauty and brain of both daxes  especially the amazing ezri

0,fully agree  i m amazed by how well most of it stands up and how exciting and varied most of the episodes are especially later on  some things bug me a bit  but all things considered it was very well done for the time 
0,i liked tasha yar s character for the potential that i saw in it  she never got a fair chance like the rest of the cast did  and because the development was so poor  she felt motivated to leave early on although they did try to remedy that by bringing her back later as herself and as  gt  sela  lt  
0,the borg ship design is totally   ripped off from   inspired by a michael jackson mini movie called  captain eo  
0,   no  we see the early traces of the orions not having slavery in lower decks  and fact osyraa is in power proves that it is not a major cultural aspect anymore  however  she is responsible for the crimes against the person she has committed

0,all movie space suits look silly because they are completely clear and have huge lights on the inside to light up the actor s faces so they can act while real space suits are completely dark and tinted so the astronauts can actually safely see out of them

0,the advanced race had direct contact with voyager  obviously  cleaning up the spacecraft before building this gigantic ship around it doesn t make sense 
0,even given how transporters work in canon  this shouldn t be the case  converting someone into energy and back still kills them
0,i m still waiting on it  they can make it a short trek if they don t want to commit to a full episode 
0, gt  they were in there for a matter of hours  oh  alright  hours still seems long enough for most away missions  the points you raise are good ones  they bear out that with the tech available as of ds9 my proposal would ve been impractical  but a foreseeable development as information storage density improved  by the time of the events in picard  transporter backups should be standard practice  then again  that show has bigger problems than this  gt  again it was an emergency measure  and not something that could be done as a matter of course  this shows that it did not take a lot of time prep  it could not only be done  at the level of neural scans  with the tech available then  but even with the limited resources available in an emergency scenario  this is a point in favor of its replicability  not against imo 
0,yes  viacomcbs  we as   true   fans demand you abandon any and all efforts to maintain and grow the legendary franchise that is 100  your intellectual property  do it because of our feeeelings  and because only we know the  true  form it should take

0,weird fact of history  gary seven has been compared to doctor who  especially given his use of a little electronic  magic wand  resembling the doctor s famous sonic screwdriver  but what s really interesting is that the episodes aired only a few months apart  so it s entirely coincidental  well  probably not coincidental  techno wands replacing the magic wands of fantasy is basically common sense and not a bizarre coincidence

0,why do trekkies talk about grumpy admirals so much  
0,didn t someone  and hopefully no one attached to the film  try to defend it to say the super evil admiral changed him to look more white  or something stupid like that  so he would look more like john harrison  like they couldn t just give him a different name that matched his original heritage

0,iirc in the ds9 relaunch novels the original character shows up as dukat s cousin lol
0,the weirdly sexualised bits of the novelisation are mostly just weird artifacts of what  60s and  70s sci fi literature could be like at times  a lot of the sci fi books from the new wave era only included this stuff because it d been taboo to include it prior to the  60s and would probably be mostly omitted today  i think if someone wrote a novelisation of tmp today  you probably wouldn t know about kirk s stiffy or his mum s gigolo 
0,this i don t mind the films  they are what they are to try and survive in the cinematic climate that exists  fair i like the first and third ones as you said  into darkness could have been a good film but instead it was half really good set up half shove all the references    in your face like i felt like the writers and directors were all saying   no seriously  we know star trek  see  you like khan  tribbles  klingons  how about    that scene in that film everyone likes  but its reversed    see  we know    and it was painful 
0,i think  and maybe this was just me trying to make sense of the film  wasn t that a sort of last ditch thing because so many ships were lost to the nerada  that was a big chunk of the fleet  and not just captains it still rubbed me the wrong way though  so don t get me wrong if the above was true  there would still be ships that survived and those ships would have commanders and lt commanders who would be better suited for command than a cadet who just cheated on an important test 
0,once i saw the black hole effects in  interstellar  i immediately thought of the multi black hole starship battle in  federation  where two versions of the  enterprise  and some klingon ships duke it out inside an event horizon

0,if a planet is threatening itself with nuclear destruction and they go through with it  do the federation really want to save them maybe  or maybe save enough innocents so there isn t a destroyed planet left behind one of the best prime directive episodes is who watches the watchers because it shows the danger of pre warp contact and why violating the prime directive is inherently dangerous as asimov states   any sufficiently advanced technology will seem as magic  to an in developed culture  as such the metinkans begin to worship picard  he does the right thing and tells them not to  but the damage is already done  now this species knows about aliens  and are contaminated think of north america before european contact  or australia  or hundreds of other cultures that were wiped out because they had resources or something another group lived on those cultures are lost or nearly lost because there was no respect for culture the federation wants there to be different cultures that exist to learn from  they don t want a culture that says  yeah we put all our resources into learning about space travel because one day the picard  who isn t a god  but some people thought  and some still think  so  and now we are here to join your federation  we just wanted to get here  we really didn t learn anything on the way there is no value in that  maybe economic value  but that is not what the federation wants  and not what the values of the prime directive are based on it is hard to look at a civilization that is on the brink of a disaster  especially if it is natural  and not do something  that is the right thing to do  i agree with that compassionate example  but what if there is a disease outbreak  like smallpox on na   hopefully advanced technology will stop that spread thanks to filters in transporters and powerful sensors and incredible medical advancements  or some other contamination  not physical  but social there is examples of  duck blind  observation of pre warp civilizations to learn about their development from a sociological and anthropological standpoint  insurrection had one as well as two other episodes one i can t remember  who watches the watchers being one of them i wonder if the value of that  but i suppose there is some damage management there  especially seeing as there are so few stories relating to that basically  i think the prime directive is required i think it is valid  and i think it is something that needs to also be flexible  and it is shown to be we are also talking about a tv show  where kirk  picard or even archer on one of their many breakings of the prime directive was court marshalled and punished by imprisonment or demotion wouldn t make for good tv of the era  it may now  now janeway in voyager has some very interesting examinations on violating the prime directive because of her circumstance  now  would you punish her upon her return to earth i would  but the punishment would be minor  maybe a promotion    a slap on the wrist  given what else she had done this is a good discussion 
0,i really disliked this episode  and i say this as someone who think garak is the best star trek character in the entire franchise  and loved andrew robinson s acting skills 
0,that s why there s character development is for  eventually both rom and nog became better people throughout the course of the show  after seeing how his mechanical genius of a father ended up as well as the bravery of those in starfleet  nog decided to enlist so he wouldn t end with the same fate as his father  in turn  after seeing own son become a better person  rom would follow suit  quit working for quark  and join ds9 s engineering crew 
0,surely anything with  star trek  in it would be reserved to this franchise anyway  i can t imagine that i d be allowed to create a movie called star trek  grilled cheese jalape√±o just because viacom forgot to trademark that weirdly specific variant 
0,maybe the hardest trek has ever made me laugh 
0,because star trek fans are the worst    they are unhappy with everything  too much action  not enough story  story isn t trek enough  story is too trek and they need to try something different  i have literally read all of it      i enjoy all of them for what they are    the only one i consider truly bad is nemesis  and even that one has its bright points  all of the others vary in quality  but if you ask me they are all pretty watchable for fans of the genre  i enjoy them for what they are or try to be  i m ok with beastie boys in anything    i could have done without the dirt bike  but honestly it worked better in beyond than it did in a lot of other movies lol  that movie was over all pretty fun in my opinion    but it  like all of jj trek  did lack some of the core  trek  ideals    what ever that means lol  i think trek   exploring  helping  and being the best human example you can be in difficult situations  that doesn t mean i can t enjoy the more action oriented movies 
0,i appreciate that they honored him  even if ever so slightly  in discovery  when they first arrive at starfleet hq  you can see one of the ships is the uss nog 
0,i m confident they d re kill culber if they really felt they needed to  i mean  they shouldn t  but they shouldn t be making michael the exact center of the cosmos either  and look where we are like  they already broke the seal with culber  they could probably kill him an infinite number of times and all of our rage at burying the gays will fall on deaf ears because hey  you got a non binary character shut up and be happy 
0,if i had to guess  his current rank is commodore and he commands a space station or something
0,no
0,you know what really set me off  the trailers literally flashed text on the screen saying  this isn t your father s star trek  some of my fondest  bonding with my father  memories is watching tos reruns after school in the 1980 s with my father  he was 11 when the series came out and loved it  and got me into the series basically from birth  and i ve been a lifelong fan as a result  that attitude of  this isn t your father s star trek  is a blatant way to say  we re turning this valuable intellectual property into something it isn t  but more average idiots will pay for it   it s the most insulting and cynical approach to movie making i can think of  they might have well said   hey  you dumb twats  your dweeb dad liked this geeky shit  but we fixed it  now it s cool or something  come see this dumb ass movie  if you want to really hurt your brain go look up the 2009 screenplay  the word  fuck  is used 36 times  it feels like a screenplay written by a jock experimenting with anabolic steroids who is super pumped   gt the corvette speeds    while inside the car  jim turns on the updated  modified radio    scans stations  momentarily losing control of the car    but he s back on track as he finds a hard rock song    and he s starting to fucking love it    piloting something this fast feels good  he reaches for a convertible roof latch    then the other    but with the speed he s driving  the roof rips right off the fucking car    jim glances back  wide eyed    and the roof tumbles through the air  landing on the road    and we push and arc around  as a police officer runs out from taking a roadside piss    he races back  jumps on his hovercruiser and takes off    speeding after him  siren blaring  back in the corvette    bloopbloop       jim s eyes dart to the rearview as the cruiser weaves behind him    then pulls up beside him    the cop sees a child driving and is amazed    he calls through his pa  cop son  you pull over that car  but jim just blasts the radio louder  jim i can t hear you  51 ext  iowa road   continuous 51 george  bag over shoulder  thumb out  he turns at the sound of the siren    sees what s approaching    that car    looks    familiar    and the the corvette shoots past him  jim at the wheel    then the police hovercruiser  this is actual text from the actual screenplay  this shit is embarassing

0,yeah  but those same ships were built with the intent purpose of fighting other people  and would start more wars then what they would stop  make a fleet of armed ship  with federation tech no less  everyone sees you as a threat  oh  and btw  since they were not part of the federation  peace treaties do not apply  the feds have diplomatic infastructure that has been built up for literally centuries 
0,don t worry  tilly leading the charge to take the ship back will be used to dampen that criticism 
0,that s why the disco writers felt the need to give cornwell a cathartic death as her series send off    she was a good person overall  but she took ethically damning decisions during the klingon war  the section 31 thing as mentioned  but also the plan to blow up kronos

0,starfleet ships are heavily armed  in tng the enterprise technology is superior to every race execpt maybe the romulans or cardassians
0,i have no idea why they went the way they did for dsc orions  it s super uncanny valley for me because it seems like they re just green humans but they still aren t  i d rather they had full range of expression rather than having a nearly entirely pointless prosthetic choking the life out of their faces tolor in particular looked bad  like  i get it  orion men appear hyper masculine  but i don t think it was worth the effort considering it takes a lot away too 
0,the motion picture is a very beautiful movie
0,i never noticed the episode title before now  came here to post this niven is woefully underrepresented but many books and shows pay homage    the halo game series with ringworld and the expanse with  well  pretty much everything from belter appearance and language to the political structure of the outer worlds 
0,how the series looked in black and white was certainly a consideration   the uniform division colors needed to be distinct in grayscale  and spock s makeup needed to look good as well 
0,the idea of utopia would be crushed if people protested the exit  as all options to prevent the protests would undermine the concept of a utopia  like deporting them out of the new coalition  or just straight up killing them all or blackmail

0,is she marrying alex kurtzman 
0,janeway had this exact question as well  mr  kim  what would you say it is that you do around here  
0,the only reason the show created in universe rules like the prime directive is to tell stories about violating it  it s an ethical statute meant to be questioned  explored  and put to the test  that s the kind of thing that makes classic trek so great  from a storytelling standpoint  the prime directive was  always  meant to be broken  without the prime directive  tng s  penpals  would have been a boring story about the enterprise saving that planet and leaving without any drama  and if they just obeyed the prime directive  they would have just flown away and letting an entire planet s civilization die  the prime directive exists to be broken in storytelling about ethical quandaries 
0,if you ignore the glaring pacing problems  it ends up being just mediocre  if you are going to reuse an episode plot  may as well make a sequel  which they did right for wrath of khan 
0,just fyi   casualties  in star trek usually mean just injuries  edit every time someone s console blows up in their face without them dying  that s a casualty 
0,but what happens to those who do not want to split from the feds  will they be silenced by the goverment  because that is the only solution i can think of  and if you do that  the concept of that government being a utopia  is going  going  and gone 
0,what is freedom to a klingon   i m not sure if i would know a freedom loving klingon from one that isn t  i do know that they are all armed  and at any given time  half of them want the chancellor dead   as a result  the chancellorship is a revolving door of murderers   perhaps if klingons weren t all afraid of being stabbed by a rival  they might develop an appreciation for freedom 
0,and if they vote no  an entire fleet of ships is hard to conceal  especially over long time periods  just drag em into a asteroid belt until you need em i guess
0,ross s argument really held water for me  he s forced to look at the big picture and remain practical   heavy is the head that wears the crown  and all that  it s easy to moralize when people aren t looking to you to lead them out of the fire  when everything is burning around you and you re the only one who can make the call to end it  the morality of the situation definitely becomes more ambiguous the impact that ross s decision in that episode  inter arms silent leges  suffers from just being a rehash of what sisko went through in in the pale moonlight  same general thing  sisko saw it the same way  inter arma silent leges revolved around bashir  so ross got painted in a bad light in comparison to dr  boyscout  but i can t argue with ross s position any more than sisko s in fact  ross got way fewer people killed under false pretenses than sisko    millions probably

0,yeah  ross may not be  clean  but he had a job to do and basically all life in the alpha quadrant was at stake  so one can t blame him for  keeping his head down  when so much was in the balance  he struck me as the kind of guy that would stick to his duty and not question the other stuff going on even if it troubled him  reminds me of colin powell in the second iraq war  decent guy surrounded by political bullshit who stuck with his duty  in powell s case it probably hurt him politically in the long run   i remember charter that he could be a contender for the first black president at one point  before the  eternal middle east war  debacle 
0,totally agree  this dude knows his audiences and plays to the mythos well 
0,a government taking action of that scale without the involvement or approval of its people or representatives is fascist   by definition   how old are you  did you not take high school civics or history  i don t want to insult you  but this is basic stuff  for an adult  if you re young i understand how you might not know about this yet

0,i watched this episode just 2 days ago  and i thought it was terrific as well  overall  s2 is incredible so far  i did want to ask which version people tended to believe  from the ending though  it seems like there was truth in all of them  but imo  the final one seemed to convey the most  the acting and story telling is just outstanding  that outburst from garak following his withdrawal is very emotional

0,vance acknowledged that osyraa s deal had considerable concessions on her part  the orions outlawing slavery and pulling out of multiple worlds they could otherwise easily subjugate and strip mine is quite a lot considering they already had discovery and therefore very likely spore drive tech    actually  that makes me think the deal couldn t possibly be legitimate  but the episode sells it well enough that i have to accept the idiocy of taking the most valuable ship in the entire galaxy and bringing it to your enemy s doorstep under any circumstance 
0,since michael isn t terribly written and neither is disco as a whole  it s more likely that it s the skin color and genitalia that you are upset about 
0,he definitely was more worldly  universely    it s almost as if she lived underground  cut off from the world  i agree it wasn t the vision of a great relationship  but so few in st are  no one cares about worf and either dex  they might have been older  by definition  the number people say  but ezra was very similar to kes in terms of age look  all it is fantasy character numbers  if it was ezra dax in kes s place  i think people would still say it s creepy because there is a 19 year age difference between the actors  seems like everyone wants to have it both ways others were saying that it was creepy he was putting naomi to bed  i mean it s very different  i don t feel that s fair on the character  it s just those people projecting on him 
0,saw through her to what ossyra made a reasonably compelling argument that she actually wants what she wants  she doesn t need anybody to pardon her for her behavior  she s already top dog of the emerald chain  she might be playing a long game to try to get rid of the federation without actually giving anything up  but on the surface of it  and assuming the lie detector wasn t compromised  she actually doesn t appear to be    uh  full of shit if the deal is legitimate  vance was extremely short sighted in demanding her head on a pike to make it happen

0,a little late to the party  but it s notable that this is the 3rd season of the show  i don t know what the nature of their contracts are  i have no idea if that has been stated by anybody  but 3 seasons seems to be fairly typical for a lot of properties  the reason picard got assimilated by the borg at the end of tng s season 3 is that stewart s contract was up if they re due for a contract renewal it s a good time to  clean up  extra  pointless characters  ahem   not to mention some actors may feel like they re not satisfied with their roles     ahem  and not want to renew their contract 
0,who is the  you  in this situation that is building these ships  like literally what person or group has this power  and how did they obtain it  who are they accountable to self governance as a concept  explicitly  prevents scenarios exactly like this i don t know anything about andromeda  so i can t totally speak to how silly a plotline that is  but it sounds really silly

0,imagine my opinion of michael is formed by her being a terribly written character on a terribly written show and has nothing to do with her race  i m quite fond of benjamin  jake  cassidy  and geordi  tuvok s okay  but far too underdeveloped  mayweather unfortunately got little to do  your accusation is so disgusting and insulting i may just stop coming to the star trek subreddit all together  enjoy your mediocre slop 
0,ambassador
0,that is why before you declare independence you spend years maybe a decade building ships in secret   that way when your people vote for independence you have the force to back it up if necessary in andromeda the neichians spent years building a fleet of ships   they didn t reveal them until they started a civil war   the commonwealth had more ships but still lost the war   the neichians would have won if two thirds of thier ships weren t wiped out at the battle of whitchhead

0, gt   it would probably be wise for them to plan to be able to defeat all their enemies at once if they united against themexcept the klingons and the romulans and the cardassians are surely all thinking the same thing  so soon enough  everyone is back to having the same amount of military power again it s a concept called the  balance of terror   some old tv show did an episode about it  you might want to look it up

0,build your ships in secret and then reveal them after your people have voted to declare independence   in andromeda the nicheans spent years or decades building a fleet of ships   they didn t reveal them until they started a civil war   i m not saying start a war i m just saying have enough ships to defend your borders   anyway the nicheans would have won the war despite the commonwealth having far more ships if andromeda hadn t gone back in time and destroyed two thirds of their ships at the battle of witchhead 
0,well    look at i this way  a space probe didn t speak english  obviously  it wasn t even conscious until it got its alien upgrades  once it scanned the enterprise computer banks and  destructively  ilia  then it  for the first time  knew how to read the letters on the side of itself  which previously would have been meaningless  so  in the first time since its quest for meaning began  it knows that the letters v ger are emblazoned on it  and it s asking its creator what the hell it all means  it never even knew those symbols were  letters  before all that stuff happened in the last few hours  that s why it took a human who had context for the situation to walk up to it and wipe off the smudge  for some reason i m reminded of the first back to the future movie  where everyone thinks marty mcfly is named calvin klein because it s written on his underwear  lol 
0,what i found really interesting about the wire was how it established that medical knowledge really is a culmination of collected research and unlike engineering and how they usually whip up something new  dr  bashir really couldn t do anything for garak on his own because he had next to no information of cardassian physiology

0,regarding the bit about enterprise being the only ship   if you go by tos alone  starfleet seems much  much smaller than later depictions  in one episode someone compliments the enterprise  and kirk responds with   thank you  there are only 12 like it in the fleet   implying that it s the top class of ship  also  before  constitution class  was a canon thing  the enterprise was dubbed a  starship class   as seen on the dedication plaque on the wall of the bridge  implying that other ships in the fleet weren t  starships  i guess  so the enterprise was probably the best asset they had against v ger  especially with her upgrades  even if she was rushed into service  one thing to support this is that her upgraded deflector screens held up against v ger s first attack  while the those poor klingons certainly didn t fare as well  fun fact about ilia being the sensual empathic whatsit   will decker and ilia were recycled into will riker and deanna troi  right down to the characters having a dramatic sexual tension due to past history  roddenberry was recycling a lot of ideas at this point  including all of tmp being basically a remake of the tos episode  the changeling   which actually wasn t even one of his own scripts  i wonder if the writer  john meredyth lucas  got royalties for tmp 
0,i thought so was alone in liking the title song
0,i think it s pretty simple   most of the time don t get in involved in the affairs of other civilizations   if they are facing a planetary disaster then do something about it   covertly if possible   overtly if necessary   as for nuclear annihilation if you can stop it covertly do so   but you should get involved only if it s absolutely necessary   and people who exploit prewarp civlizations for their own personal  or political gain should be thrown in jail   so it s similar to the federation and the prime directive   but with some flexibility   basically they would only get involved if it s absolutely necessary   and they could do so without having to worry about a court martial 
0, gt  yes and the actions of the federation endorsing her by not insisting she stand trial is an action that says to the galaxy  we value our own stability over the atrocities you faced  no  it sends the message to the rest of the galaxy that  we will not interfere with the internal politics of other societies because we practice what we preach   the prime directive  regime change can neither be expected or realistically insisted upon as a condition for peace between two independent nations  and would further be a violation of the prime directive  gt  this is a woman that threatened famine  that bombarded words from orbit  that engaged in torture  murder and god knows what else  if the federation gets in bed with her they re sending a message to everyone that they don t really value justice  you don t think the klingons  not to mention the federation   bombarded from orbit   you don t think the klingons murdered or tortured   yet the federation was content to make peace with them the message the federation would be sending is  we value justice by making decent  ethical treatment a precondition of peace    prosecuting osyraa doesn t bring back the dead or restore lost years to those who were enslaved   but making peace helps prevent more dead and frees those that are still enslaved   that matters a whole lot more  gt  again this doesn t seem to have anything to do with what i said or what we see in the show  the federation is materially helping its people s lives  and the lives of others  we see that throughout the series  that doesn t mean they have to condone the actions of a warlord  long term that isn t going to do the federation any favours it has  everything  to do with what you said  but perhaps you are confused by the use of  they  as a pronoun you said  how many worlds that have suffered under the chain will continue to see the federation as an ideal if they publically stand by a warlord slaver  so my response is  what good is the federation doing for those worlds  the ones suffering under the chain  by being seen as an  ideal  if the people on those worlds  the ones suffering under the chain  aren t having their lives being made materially better by the federation  i m pretty sure  abolishing slavery  is both a moral and material good that outweighs nearly anything the federation has  or could  do so far  short of annihilating the chain entirely  which they seem incapabe of doing  even if they were willing to   gt   if the federation signed that treaty without stipulations that there should be consequences it would be like the end of the second world war without the nuremberg trials you re comparing apples and bowling balls   the second world war ended with unconditional surrender   but we re talking about peace between two nations who both continue to operate independently   we re not talking about the federation taking over the emerald chain  gt  those who suffered under the chain would receive the message loud and clear that the federation isn t interested in getting them justice the federation didn t insist on gorkon being prosecuted for the crimes of the klingon empire   are you suggesting that the federation was sending a message  loud and clear  to the worlds the klingons conquered that they weren t interested in getting them justice

0, gt they still have similar rules that the federation does but they are more flexible not really  they are an independent militia group dedicated solely to driving the cardassians from their planets  they have no central government or judicial system  and most if not all of the planets they come from have local governments that do not  officially  support them as for their attitude about the prime directive  they only care about their own planets  their political views as a group begin and end with opposition to the federation cardassian peace treaty i m sure a lot of them believe in the prime directive  since it s long been a part of federation culture  a lot of them are ex starfleet  too  so i m sure if they had ever got the independence they wanted and formed their own rules on this topic  they might adopt the same ones

0,yeah  tos is sometime just annoying  with the bad graphics and wonky sets  it may have had some good bits here and there  but enterprise and voyager are just the best 
0,because the writing is weak  particularly in the second one for instance  it makes no sense that kirk keeps sacrificing himself for spock  and that spock rages when kirk dies   when it s clear the characters  aren t  close at all   they haven t earned any emotional investment in one another  and have none  and yet the characters spontaneously act as if they do or the use of augment blood   a renewable resource   as a magical cure for death  with all of the longterm dramatic implications for the  star trek  universe being completely ignored   not to mention that magic resurrections dramatically cheapen death and sacrifice as costs that are paid by characters i do believe that many who dislike all three movies  or the trilogy as a whole  would have a much fonder view of the series if it weren t for the second movie specifically   unfortunately  it s bad enough that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth when watching the others as well

0, gt  they weren t murdered because janeway did the right thing lol no  they weren t murdered because it was a transporter accident  equating the accident to murder doesn t make sense  nobody pointed a phaser at them and forced them into the transporter after it was primed to merge them  the accident was not murder and should not be treated as such  gt  you say you don t want tuvok and neelix to remain dead but you want to keep them dead for the benefit of tuvix frankly  yes  if two of my best friends died today in an accident and i could have them back instantly by murdering a completely innocent person i hope i would do the right thing  wish that person peace and accept that i won t see my friends again  autocratically choosing to murder someone sets a terrible precedent and i firmly believe janeway would have been court martialed had she done this in the alpha quadrant because she traded her principles for convenience at the expense of an innocent  sentient life  one may call me cold for not saving my friends  yet i find it even colder to trade one life for another  or two   gt  so as long as they lived for a while you think they don t deserve life  how does that work  so if tuvix lived for longer than neelix  you think just because of that tuvix should be killed  you did say  nobody lives forever  and  they had the time they had  so by that logic everyone should be shipped off on an iceberg at 60 lol ok  there s a lot to unpack here  i think everyone deserves life  it s not about how long someone lives  or if they lived  a more virtuous  life than someone else  it s about the principle of respecting free will and personal sovereignty  what happened to tuvok and neelix was tragic  but to take from one to give to another when the result is murder and erasure of that one s autonomy  no thank you  that s a dangerous path to follow  gt  by that logic everyone should be shipped off on an iceberg at 60 lol this is exactly the kind of arbitrary dictatorship i m decrying and honestly  this is essentially what janeway did  gt  yet you want to trample the rights of both tuvok and neelix to live this is way out in left field  i m not trampling tuvok s or neelix s rights at all  their rights were respected all the way to the end  nobody committed any crime or injustice against them and yet you re assuming there s some massive debt that must be paid by tuvix as if he murdered them  he s completely innocent  gt  how does that come out better than only trampling one person s rights this is the issue  my position is nobody s rights should be trampled  and though tuvok and neelix got the short end of the straw this time around  their rights were unmarred  it s sad  but they enjoyed autonomy  why is it ok to take away tuvix s autonomy to reverse an accident which was nobody s fault  especially tuvix s  freedom for all should always be the gold standard and when we lose sight of that dictatorship takes over let me remind you you re arguing for the murder of an innocent individual while dressing it up as  justice  because you re equating the accident with murder  which it most certainly was not 
0,i don t think it s fair to excuse norah satie  her actions carried the weight of authority  some of which was due to her previous position also  while i think overall cornwell was a good admiral  wasn t she sleeping with a direct subordinate   not  good look in a post  metoo world

0,in larry niven s known space universe  crashlander  ringworld  etc  there are addicts known as  wire heads  who are addicted to a pleasure causing electronic device implanted in the brain  there s also a weaponized version called a tasp that is feared because the pleasure is debilitating and also being hit with it can lead you to become a wire head   also the kzinti from tas appear in the same series of books  and i believe were introduced in the books prior to their appearance in tas   basically some star trek writers are big larry niven nerds 
0,the motion picture started development 3 years before star wars came out  star wars nearly made them scrap it in favour of another series  star trek  phase ii  when they came to the conclusion that lucas  epic had spelled the end of  thinking person s  science fiction in theaters until  close encounters of the third kind  hit it big  and convinced them to give it another chance 
0, gt   m ok with things looking more advanced  my problem is it s essentially a period piece  like  it s set in a specific time in a fictional universe  but then completely abandons that style and look  and they gained nothing from being set in that time that i can see other than trying to use sarek to get people into the show it s really weird in choices and execution that way  like  if you were doing saving private ryan  but decided that ww2 era military stuff is too 40s ish  and so put in drones and f35s and gps because that s what people want to see in the  modern era   well  that s a really weird way to tell a story about ww2 and for all that they want to do a new thing  and be new trek  they also kept calling back to and pushing things from tos into the show  sarek  amanda  pike  enterprise  etc etc  so it s pretty hard to take it as it s own thing while they force you to keep thinking about it as part of the greater world tng did this a lot better imho  they did a 5 minute cameo with mccoy  then had a rule to not talk about kirk  spock  etc and to do things as their own show separate from tos  it helped that they were also set 100 years in the future so they could use 80s tech to make it look modern without feeling weird in relation to tos

0, gt  of course there is  ideals aren t invulnerable  she said it herself that the federation is seen as legitimate by most in the galaxy  even if it is diminished using the fear that your enemies aren t sincere in their reforms can be used as an excuse to never engage in reconciliation or peace   if you feel your beliefs and ideals are so vulnerable that they can t hold while engaged with a previous enemy  then they re probably not important enough to you in the first place  gt  she wants to use the federation to give the chain a vaneer of legitimacy she s adopting federation values and reforms   that s not a veneer of legitimacy  that s the path to change   it s actions  not words  gt  she s willing to make some concessions sure  but how many worlds that have suffered under the chain will continue to see the federation as an ideal if they publically stand by a warlord slaver a  what good is the federation doing by being an unreachable  ideal  that won t get involved in materially helping your peoples  lives for fear of staining themselves b  the federation wasn t publicly standing by a warlord slaver   just the opposite  in fact    abolition was on the table 
0,it s a great episode of star trek it s kind of a boring  slow movie padded out with pointless visual effects  i can forgive the enterprise fly aroud   they wanted to show off the star  but the 10 minute trip through v ger s energy shields  and the 10 minute acid trip of spock mind melding with v ger were nearly a quarter of the movie s total running time that could have been compacted by 90  and gotten the same information across

0, gt   it shouldn t be immune to criticism but we should also realise that this show has to appeal to more than just trekkies to survive being canneddoes it  i mean  i feel like with all the choice for tv now  you basically have to make niche shows  i m pretty sure no one is getting 1980s era ratings for each episode  i mean  on the one hand  when there were 3 choices for channels at one time  you just had to be better than whatever else was on the other channel  however  with streaming  you need to either be  amazing  or you need to be unique   niche some how to draw an audience  it s too easy to just click on to something enjoyable to you 
0,yeah basically that was what happened   star wars was a huge success  and paramount was like  hey don t we have a star something franchise    thus  star trek tmp is made  saving star trek and kickstarting a series of movies that would lead into tng and the great star trek renaissance of the 90s

0,republic means the public thing and it refers to  the law   not laws  the constitution isn t a law  it s the top law  it isn t subject to change by the whims of the majority plus one  and it doesn t matter if the two have existed for more than two millennia and have borrowed from one another  it doesn t matter that modern political science along with other academic courts that rule over other subjects  change the meaning of words and move the goal posts  a republic isn t a democracy and vice versa  you can t slap one upon another  ie there are no democratic republics  there are representative democracies and there are republics with limited degrees of elective elements  and frankly it s the manipulation of these things that make people illiterate on the subject of political history generally but in the us particularly  it wouldn t do not to change the narrative about what is and is not a republic or a democracy when you re busy democratizing and therefore eroding the constitutional framework of a nation  that is the history of the us  democratize  abuse  change the narrative  if people spent less time with the semantics and more with the history they d know that the roman republic wasn t democratic in terms of how their people voted on laws and they d know the same for the us  the complete opposite was true of greece  and what many don t know is that the us didn t even have voting for the electors by the population in the early days of the republic  as many don t know that there is no right to vote in federal elections even today  there are grounds for which voting in federal elections can t discriminate  but the right to vote itself is absent because it didn t exist to begin with  the power to vote in federal elections belongs in the hands of the state houses and over time they ve devolved that to the people as part of the process of choosing electors  but it wasn t always the case  and as the people elected their representatives to represent them in the house  the state houses voted the electors for president and voted for appointees to the senate to represent the states  equally two for each  but then we passed the 14th amendment to tax income directly on the promise it wouldn t impact more than the top 2  of the wealthiest  and we couldn t expand that taxing power without expanding the voting power for the political class  it s also difficult to have endless wars without drumming up some popular ire or passing some of that power on from congress to the president  so how do we do that  we democratize  so it s a government of and by the people  a nonsense notion from a republican perspective  so the 14th amendment  the 17th amendment democratized the senate  and then in 1863 the last state  south carolina democratizes the electoral college voting to the polling place the federal government expands into public education  media and academia push the notion that we have a democracy and since we vote on every political position it seems we have no reason to complain because we get what we choose  but the us isn t a democracy  it s not written in the federal or any state constitutions  and no political scientist or dictionary have the ability to change the meaning of something because of a consensus of a group representing an authority  the history of something and it s use and place in history does  if you re legitimately interested you might study some of the earlier political campaigns of the early republic  if you re interested in the difference between democracy and republic i would look at examples of greek democracy in athens and compare it to the centuriate of the roman republic  as in the early american republic  even the romans did not allow direct election of public officers because they knew the weaknesses of democracy  they knew of the greeks at that time

0, gt if the show didn t have the trek name  i likely would have dropped it long ago and perhaps i should have this is actually one of my pain points too  i dropped disco after episode 4 of season 1 for the first season  the interesting commentary podcasts and youtube channels brought me back  but as those are dropping because they just can t stand discovery anymore  i m having even less reasons to watch it any more  in a lot of ways if discovery wasn t  star trek  i would never have gone back to it  i think season 3 is probably my last  and i too have gotten no enjoyment out of the episodes but felt i needed them to enjoy the commentary shows 
0,i agree 
0,i think my problem with discovery is i just don t like the characters  like  kirk or sisko are awesome  and i know they are trying to do what they think is for the greater good  and it s super easy to forgive them because we like them  the other shows helped the cast  earn  their swagger before they were saying to the admirals or whoever  i know better  and shows them caring about the rules before  heroically breaking  them  discovery goes out of its way to  make the main character unlikable in the pilot and does little for seasons to help us like any of the characters imo  because discovery never earns any of its story beats or emotional points  we never really see michael be heroic so much as messianic and the character is just soo grating  the problem is that michael started with mutiny  per the show   so now when she breaks the rules it just plays to me as  oh there she goes again  thinking she s above the law and knows  best   rather than someone who is a representative of the  good guys  needing to be  grey  in spots  then the entire disco crew seems morally challenged   to the extent they couldn t figure out lorca was mirror  to the acceptance of mirror georgiou  to the literal toasting of her  etc  what s worse is that where previous shows usually showed many of these tropes as negative and the show seemed to be pointing out they re bad  discovery seems to be embracing tokenism  groups segregating with themselves  and re rehabilitating  anyone   maybe everyone deserves another chance  but i really really have trouble with burnham and georgiou being considered  good people  now

0,i m sorry  but i  and mainstream political science  politely disagree  your definition of democracy differs heavily from what is commonly understood as a democracy  and while the words  republic  and  democracy  have different origins  there have been quite some historical developments between then and now that have shaped both terms and what they mean today republic also doesn t just mean  rule of law   as that would be quite meaningless  considering that laws are man made and  unless we find ourselves in a theocracy  not god given  the important part here is who decides what becomes law  which in a monarchy be the king queen and in a republic  the people   a republic   like the us for example   could absolutely have a law that   for example   says that you can own another inhabitant of the same country or have laws that say that one person can vote and the other not  because one is a man and the other is a woman republic and democracy are so closely intertwined that it is quite impossible to find a non democratic republic  but it is easy to find non republic democracies  like the uk   yet both the uk and the us are representative democracies  the uk is not a republic because it is a monarchy  not because it also happens to be a democracy as i already pointed out  a democracy that deviates from democratic values   even if decided by democratic vote   ceases to be a democracy  of course in reality there is a lot more gray and democracies tend to be on a continuum  but the fight to uphold the basic democratic principles  like minority rights  is also part of a healthy democracy 
0,who hates neelix  neelix was the ambassador for voyager whenever they went into a new territory  hell he was able to talk to people janeway couldn t  so who has a problem with neelix   sure he was annoying at times but most people who are always bubbly are annoying to me but they help get things done  so they are very necessary

0,i think it s incredibly reductive to blame the bad reviews on ist a phobe types there is a ton of problems with the show  it seems to have lost any semblance of science fiction for one  now  that s not just a characteristic of disco when it comes to trek  later ds9 didn t involve much sci fi either  turning to space opera the acting is frequently bad  michael yelling rapidly at the suit and then it flying away and then her screaming laughing whatever didn t sell me on sonequa s abilities but bad writing and direction can derail an acting job quick in terms of the other actors adira looks like they straight up shit themselves in every shot   just this queasy frown that the actor always portrays tilly doesn t sell me at all on being a capable first officer because so much of the time when she s talked she talked about just herself    and in season one said she was autistic  but then suddenly the show makes her a strong decisive leader that people follow grey is bad  he looks like he is trying to sell you drugs in high school  he s got this sleezy grin on and all of his line readings are bad tig may be a funny comedienne but she is no actor  getting a job just because you re a friend of ak doesn t mean we should have to watch her on top of that  i know nothing about most of the bridge crew  i know a few names  and there too many shots where people are talking so the camera does wierd spins or dutch angles    shit that battlefield earth was lambasted for by roger ebert this is basically a ya post apoc show  this is for young adults  not people who like science fiction  it s the  100  it may was well be on the cw

0, gt  ah  ok  i m not saying tuvok and neelix should be murdered  but they weren t  yet  tuvix was and this is somehow just they weren t murdered because janeway did the right thing lol  gt  the point i m trying to make is that all three individuals must have their rights respected equally  tuvok and neelix lived free lives  did the transporter accident cut them short  yes  but should another sentient being be murdered so they can continue to live their lives  absolutely not you say you want to respect everyone s rights yet you want to kill tuvok and neelix  gt  one cannot venerate the rights of tuvok and neelix at the expense of tuvix anymore than one can do it the other way around  to be clear  i don t particularly like tuvix  i already stated that  i also don t want tuvok and neelix to remain dead you say you don t want tuvok and neelix to remain dead but you want to keep them dead for the benefit of tuvix  gt  but the big important issue here is that tuvix s creation was an accident  fate  act of god  whatever you want to call it  accidents happen all the time and nobody lives forever so  just because he was an accident he has more right to live than 2 people  how does that work  what if tuvok was an unplanned pregnacy because his dad had pon farr a couple weeks early  does that mean you think he finally  has as much right to live than tuvix  gt  but they had the time they had  so as long as they lived for a while you think they don t deserve life  how does that work  so if tuvix lived for longer than neelix  you think just because of that tuvix should be killed  you did say  nobody lives forever  and  they had the time they had  so by that logic everyone should be shipped off on an iceberg at 60 lol  gt  and their rights were respected their rights were respected by janeway when she saved them lol  gt  my position is that it is entirely improper to trample the rights of tuvix and murder him to give tuvok and neelix however much more time they would have had afterwards yet you want to trample the rights of both tuvok and neelix to live  how does that come out better than only trampling one person s rights

0,that s benamite for quantum slip stream  different thing  qss was shown in voyager but it had two major problems  firstly it was extremely dangerous and secondly the crystals needed for it were incredible rare and volatile  they could be synthesised slowly  at huge cost  then would degrade quickly  and iirc had a chance to explode  book mentions in episode 1 that his ship has a qss drive so presumably the technology was made safer  but he implies that benamite is still very rare  far rarer than dilithium still 
0,start with the movies    they are pretty consistent  with quality and production values     with one or two exceptions 
0,good call  another commenter said they needed a certain crystal type from the first episode  so i guess they were able to get some 
0,i mean  if you take that line of thinking then the new movies are fine  they were certainly popular  entertaining  well cast  acted and well made  yes they stuffed around with plot holes and stuff but hey  most superhero space operas do so it s not a crime  but in reality it s impossible not to watch these in context of the shows history  i know for a fact my dislike of into darkness isn t a judgement of the quality of the movie itself  but because of how it fucked around with its interpretations of previous trek  i don t have a balanced response  i would say many trek fans don t  one way or the other 
0,hmmm  that s a tough one  on one hand discovery is definitely geared for that age  on the other it makes going to previous series  a little painful from a special effects and non stop action standpoint   that being said  i was born in the 70 s  and didn t really start watching star trek until nearly 20 years after tos and started with tos  i d say start with tos and set expectations regarding it then move on from there  honestly each series so far struggles a little in the first sometimes second season to define themselves and find their balance  ds9 didn t start interesting me until season 3 and i mostly skipped it when it first came out  bonus to point out just how bold the show was for its time  height of the civil rights movement and the first ever interracial kiss on tv  etc   that s what star trek is all about anyway  right   pushing social limits to accept new things  working toward an all inclusive society etc 
0,thank you for this post  i ve been really getting annoyed with how often the  all admirals are bad  trope has been popping up  but didn t have the time or energy to research every single admiral i am a little disappointed to see people trying to turn ross into a badmiral considering we ve seen much worse through the series  from the real bad ones  i d at worst say neutral  but neutral wasn t really on the scale and wouldn t increase the already low count 
0,now what i believe is irrelevant    all trek is star trek  what you believe is your own opinion  star trek has always stood for hope  picard might have strayed a bit from that hope  but we don t know what the 2nd season holds  the first season is always the burnt pancake   unless you re discovery    the only good season was the 2nd one   i truly believe things will move on  star trek strange new worlds holds a lot of promise  because pike is the epitome of that hope   starfleet is a promise   he and the enterprise crew were the truly good  thing to come out of discovery  it will be episodic trek once again 
0,the actors can only portray what the writers write in the way the director tells them to do it  it s not so much  bad acting  as it is poor writing and desperate directing trying to make poor writing work  there s a lot wrong with disco and pic but  hey  it s not the actors  fault

0,they never said it was  the federation partakes in trade all the time in the shows without being capitalist  i think the point here was meant to show that the chain operates with private property whereas the federation does not  the whole  never had a real apple  dialogue was a subtle way of showing us that despite being starfleet s cic vance is not better off materially than anyone else  whereas in the chain someone like ossyra gets to enjoy luxuries while others are bought and sold as chattel

0,democracy and republics are mutually exclusive  they were developed by two different cultures at two different times  first democracy by the greeks  a compound word demos kratos meaning the people rule  and the the republic at a later time by the romans and is a latin compound of the words res publica which means   the public thing   in this context  the law  the roman republic enshrined its law in a series of tablets which is a proto constitutional idea  but reserving that which is to be foundational and above the whims or dictates of the majority  in the us we did the same thing with the constitution  it is why you can t call something  hate speech  and ban people from saying said thing  because the law is above the wishes of the people  as a contrast the uk is a representative democracy  a majority in parliament can change virtually anything in its representation of the will of the people  it can and has deemed certain terms to be hate speech  overturning centuries of liberal tradition in the uk regarding speech  but that is the difference between a republic and a democracy  you can t shove the two together and you shouldn t conflate them  democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on dinner  a republic is the law stating that no one can be sacrificed as dinner  regardless of any vote  and the needs of the many is exactly an example of utilitarian ethics  you are correct  but in terms of governing philosophy it is very much in line with democracy in that the majority plus one are the many  they can override the consideration of the few or the one  it s in my opinion an evil screed and one of the few things i dislike about the vulcan philosophy which shares traits with buddhism and stoicism  but the needs of the many outweigh the few or the one is at best a mills ian construction  one often used to justify the worst crimes of humanity  and the crimes usually begin with a democracy or the democratization of a republic  because that quickly leads to totalitarianism  either in that form similar to the roman empire or that which looks like leninism and the soviet union 
0,that seems to be the popular answer here haha
0,borg have demonstrated they don t adapt to purely kinetic attacks   whether that s the tommy gun in fc or a bat leth 
0,in the very last episode when they were wondering how ossyra got to the nebula  which is described as being very out of the way  book says there s an old subspace corridor nearby that couriers sometimes use  but it s very dangerous  which fits with what we ve seen before in trek with things like the vadwuur  or however it s spelt  in voyager who terrorised their region of space with subspace tunnels  after they went into hibernation the tunnels quickly degraded to become very dangerous it seems convenient that the corridor led from the nebula to hq  so i assume that when they were in it they got as close as they could and then  tunneled  from it the rest of the way like all non warp ftl at this point in the setting s history it s not safe  or reproducible  so can t fully replace warp 
0,to add to your valid point grew up with a guy who was born missing his left arm from the elbow down  or had the arm amputated shortly after birth due to deformities not sure  as an adult he had a chance to be a part of some prosthetics research that in theory could have given him a semi functional arm  he didn t do it because he didn t want another arm  having one arm and a stub was all he knew and it never limited him  this would be somewhat similar to what laforge experienced with riker  minus magical means 
0, gt  he also cheated on the kobiyashi maru test yeah  but in the prime timeline  there s no indication that this was explicitly against the rules at the time  there s an argument to be made that it was against the spirit of the simulation  which is probably what was meant by kirk cheating on it  but no evidence that it was explicitly against the rules while in the abramsverse  it s meant to be taken as a sign of kirk being rebellious  in the prime timeline  it s meant to show his ability for original thinking  he was even awarded a commendation for it in the prime timeline 
0,for a brief period of time  ultimately they d be ineffective against the borg  right  unless the transporter component was capable of materializing the projectile within the personal shield of the borg drone   but i d imagine they would adapt to the gun s transporter effect
0,ohhhhh man are you in for a treat
0, gt  less sense it makes having a ship that can reform has several pros   the modular nature means you can swap in and out different parts as missions require  the ship configuration can be changed based on current need  e g  adopting a more defensive form  in an emergency you can get people or vital cargo out of the danger zone  like a saucer separation as for the people in those parts they don t feel anything  the door to the section will refuse to open for a bit  and then open to potentially reveal a different room than before  but with inertial dampners no one is getting thrown around

0,i think we ll see a second federation but not with the emerald chain  at least not first  ossyra said she had to burn a lot of political capital to get concessions the federation would agree with  going home empty handed is going to leave her significantly diminished in the face of  in her words  some very wealthy people micheal send a distress call to her mother on ni var  i m betting the ni varans come to the federation s aid which  along with the good work put in by discovery  opens the door for another kind of reunification as for the spore drive i think instead they re setting it up that it remains unique  i ve suspected throughout this season that reproducing the drive was going to be shown to be insanely hard  this episode pretty much confirmed my theory that the modifications to stamets that made him a compatible navigator were unique to him  in order to make more you d need a tardigrade  and the whole  we ll clone one  plan is too logical to work  p    with the dilithium planet and the potential for ni var to align with the federation again i suspect we ll see warp become more widespread  and possibly the sb project will be completed discovery having a powerful  but ultimately unique  drive gives it a solid role in the show  and it wouldn t surprise me if the writers really don t want the drive to be replicated  because it would really make writing stories a headache if everyone could travel anywhere instantly at any time 
0, gt  a slaver called themselves a capitalist and you believed them  shame on you i don t get what you re trying to say here  you can be a slaver and be a capitalist too 
0,yeah  i wouldn t call admiral picard  bad  in part for this reason  but mostly because he s a main character  so he can t really do this trope on the other hand  i would put clancy in the bad column  i know people like her  and i do  too  but it wasn t just that she sassed at picard  it s when she said the federation gets to decide who lives and who dies  and was clearly implied to have supported a far more cautious than necessary commitment to the romulan evacuation effort that s not the same thing as covertly recruiting red squad to do a terrorism  but way more people died as a result of that attitude 
0,no problem  always happy to share in anything trek  one thing i think you ll enjoy about tng  besides sir patrick  is the first two seasons have strong tos vibes since gene roddenberry was directly involved at that point still  imo season 3 onwards tng shows it true colors and no longer lives in tos  shadow  there s a few gems in them early seasons that are amongst the best episodes  ds9 is a whole other animal entirely  you ll see when you get there  it starts slow but the pay off is so worth it

0, needs of the many  has nothing to do with democracy  if anything it is a utilitarian dogma democracy in a narrower sense refers to a government that is legitimized through public elections  in a more specific sense a real democracy also includes certain characteristics that go beyond just the technicalities of elections  one important characteristic is minority rights if a democracy lacks several of these characteristics it ceases to be a real democracy  that s why countries like russia are often also designated as  illiberal democracies  and single party dictatorships aren t democratic to begin with also  a republic is not the opposite of a democracy but of a monarchy  so the us were founded as a republic and a democracy 
0,and it can be forgiven as a product of its time  a modern movie shouldn t get a pass 
0,i think beyond the second from last question  the survey feels heavily skewed towards super fans  as most of the responses reflect a deeper level of fandom than most casual fans might display  with 2 out of 3 answer choices indicating a relatively deep level of connection to the series  the question i mentioned was just the most obvious example of the narrow response options  non super fans have very few options that might reflect their experience with the show  this will ultimately skew your results as people will attempt to make choices that are a close proximity   which is pretty undesirable in terms of reliability and validity  a likert scale that goes beyond 1 3 and that focuses on one specific behavior you re wanting to assess  could provide more nuanced answer choices for non super fans 
0,makes sense  bank you  there was lot going on in that episode
0,okay  i may have misunderstood your intent  but the  actually liked  sounded like you were trying to say that there are not people who actually like dsc

0,i didn t say that   i said it was a fair take   you misquoted me   i was saying that at the time the stage actor melodrama was often seen as a strength   people compared it to shakespeare  which is obviously not realistic at all

0,i wish someone would create an edit that doesn t have as many long shots of the enterprise and v ger  it d probably be half as long and have much better pacing lol 
0,it s legit criticism  abrahms himself said that he realized he overused it in the first film also  the two storyline elements that i mentioned were legitimately bad the kirk promotion is completely off the wall  since he s a cadet on the ship only because of the favor of the ship s captain  we are told and shown that he s a complete screw up  even the crowning moment of badass  where he cheats on the kobiyashi maru is shown with complete lack of care and while voyager did show a previous storyline with a blood transfusion leading to a revival from death  at least seven of nine has literal zombie making nanites in her blood that make sense for that  khan is just a really strong human and on the subject of khan  what the hell was up with that reveal  the way he draws out  my name is khan  is like that name is supposed to mean something to the average person  but it doesn t  that s only there for the audience  and it wasn t even earned  because we knew he was khan from  the beginning by the way  i didn t particularly  hate  the film series  myself  i  hate  star trek v  i enjoyed 2009 and into darkness  i usually forget about beyond 
0,i enjoy the movie as the one most like the show in story   but if you really wanna see weird  read the novelization   oh my   it includes kirk reminiscing about his mom s  love instructor   kirk getting a woody  kirk thinking about rumors of he and spock being gay  kirk getting a mental  email  about vger through some weird ass implant  etc   just bizarre 
0,it s the one where mcnulty has too much to drink 
0, the difference is people actually liked it  you don t like it the acting in discovery  but don t act like your opinion is representative of all fans  plenty of us do like the acting in discovery  i don t understand this impulse some people have to try to speak on behalf of all fans 
0,i was about to suggest that matt decker be given a break  but then i got to thinking about it and  bad  really is correct   the facts presumably the constellation science officer told him the same information as spock that the doomsday machine s neutronium hull would render conventional weapons ineffective decker clearly kept the constellation in a hopeless fight for too long   the enterprise takes a number of hits from the machine with shields down without incurring a fraction of the damage sustained by the constellation decker makes a tactical error to battle the machine instead of withdrawing to alert starfleet  who at the very least could scare up a relief force decker can not necessarily be blamed for evacuating the constellation  as he presumably did not know the machine would discontinue its attacks when the ship s energy signature fell below a threshold level   however  when you observe the machine smashing planets  maybe beaming the crew onto a planet in its vicinity isn t a great idea   surely using shuttlecraft would have been a better alternative to evacuate at least some of the crew

0,i rewatched it the other day  it s certainly enjoyable  but it has it s issues  i m ok with the plot holes of a half assembled enterprise being the only ship in the federation in the vicinity of earth  got to have some contrivances to explain why only the main cast are going to be able to save to day  some moments though are a bit eye rolling  like the only other female crew member being a psychic sex object  i once read that the deltan race were planned for st phase ii  and there was a bunch of stuff written about how their culture was obsessed with sex  wouldn t surprise me if that was rodenberry who seemed to want to insert overtly sexual races into the show every now and then  like the ferrengi who wore codpieces initially because rodenberry wanted them to have massive dicks

0,i agree that frivolous criticisms tossed around about old and new series alike  however  the majority of the criticisms surround the new series concerns writing  direction  storytelling  world building  and verisimilitude  star trek has typically been great at all of these things  yet the most recent series seems to sacrifice them for blockbuster production aesthetic nothing wrong if that s what you like  but don t marginalize other s preferences just because you enjoy it 
0,so did you actually answer that question in good faith  or did you just repeat the same boring critiques people have been making since they came out 
0,my favorite part about that episode is that tasha was killed off   i really disliked not only the character  but the actress  although  the way tng turned around starting in season 3  it s entirely plausible the writers could ve fixed that    eventually

0,there isn t so much merch  i m one of those fans that remember when there was merch  and it didn t matter that it was aimed at  kids   plenty of grown adults bought and collected them  and it wasn t some books and some comics with a few lines of ship  books  comic  costumes  collectors plates  pewter models  replica phasers  tricorders  etc   not the play toys versions  but those too  play sets  models  pins  music  action figures  and the list goes on and on  i had a phone shaped like the starship enterprise a universal tv remote that was a type ii phaser  starship blue prints  script books  magazines  i still have those   and so much more  not to mention the pins  rings  necklaces  t shirts  mugs and print to order gifts and small sideline items that still exist today  those were in addition to things that existed before  there were more than four major toy brands producing stuff for star trek  i still have many action figures  ships  a tricorder and a 3  bust of captain picard  just stuff that doesn t exist and won t again  it s just over  cockier hipsters that know better have come to make trek cooler than before  the downside is that you won t documentaries in ten years featuring astronauts who were inspired to space when they were seven because  star trek  the exceptional becomes the mundane  it s the real sad part and that damage has been done  so you re right  people love the new stuff  flocking to it  can t get enough of that winning  take your victory and revel in it  someone has to enjoy mediocre star trek and sing it s praises  the future won t be

0,hmm  i would hazard a guess that 2nd show will replace picard  which was designed as a 3 season show   this is jan 2020 so lockdown wasn t really a thing yet if i remember correctly  meaning picard was probably supposed to have filmed it s 2nd season by now  and maybe we would even have it done having another show feels unnecessary an a bit much given the length of a year each show  but not having picard might not fill a year

0,honestly  and this has been said before but i really feel it s true  it feels as though the people writing this show don t even want to write trek  it feels as though they would be much happier writing just a sci fi action show with space battles and shootouts where they could ignore all the previous lore  more than they do already

0,the first 10 star trek movies have that trek flare  they have thought provoking  emotional  heavy scenes  kirk losing spok  picard facing the borg again  data sacrificing himself  the jj trek movies are just brainless action packed popcorn summer blockbusters  i believe it s the same problem with the new trek shows as well  nothing in pic or dis has made me sit back in my chair after the credits and go    damn   many ds9  voy  or tng episodes made me do that like  in the pale moonlight  drumhead  measure of a man   lets not even talk about the continuity errors

0,i get what you re saying  and i don t agree that the acting is bad at all  i think part of the problem is the writing  people are interpreting the acting as being  bad  because in many cases  the emotions aren t earned  when burnham is crying  or elated  or exhausted  or frustrated   the actress is legitimately good at conveying those emotions  however  when she s oscillating between them in the span of ten minutes  it s going to seem erratic  and when the emotions of the characters are  so high   which they tend to be in this show  there s very little to compare it to  the  calm  moments are few and far between compared to the emotional ones  so there isn t a lot of context  all of these actors are good  i don t think there d be any criticism of their abilities if they were in a different show

0,cornwell and the other discovery admirals were also ready to go along with the emperor s plan to commit genocide in season 1  though they were talked out of it by our main cast  
0,just my opinion but the first movie is basically the plotnof star wars  its kind of shallow and takes a lot of liberties to put a cadet in the captains chair just because its kirk that that s where the audience knows he should be  it just makes no sense the second movie is a weird re harsh of wrath of khan but is missing the backstretch to set things up and all the nuance and themes from the original  so its just an old plot done worse  there s nothing significantly wrong with the 3 one  its actually original and is the best of the 3  the most star trekky 
0,i can buy that some people  think  they can tell the difference and put a lot of stock in that  there have been plenty of studies irl that show that wine experts can t tell the difference between so called good wine and regular store bought bottles  similarly stradivarius violins were rated as sounding worse by experts in a blind test compared to brand new violins  but people still insist they can and over value items seen to be premium whether or not this kind of thing would still exist in a post scarcity world where material possessions are not a sign of status   seems less likely  but in fairness the vast majority of people seem to have no complaints about replicated food  from memory there are few examples of people who do espouce this view  and all of them are a bit outside the norm  e g   the sisko s run an  authentic  restaurant for fun  so authentic they don t even have a dishwasher    picard s brother who kept his house free of 24th century technology

0,if it s good trek fans will watch it again and again  i watched some voyager last night  and it s arguably the weakest of the original trek spin offs  if nutrek is good then the numbers will be there on netflix  aa  or prime  i don t think they are  the interest doesn t appear to be there in google trends and the number of people who are now changing their tune online regarding season 3 of discovery is something i never imagined i would see  but it s not for me to say  there s a quintessential element that makes star trek  nutrek doesn t have it  cbs could re film little house on the prairie and put  star trek  on it and we wouldn t call it star trek because they say so  it s an appeal to the absurd  because star trek is like a hammer  water  night or day  and anything else that exists  there is what it is and when it isn t  then it s not  but this current iteration has its fans  maybe you re one of them  that s certainly okay  it s a free country  watch it and enjoy it  convince your friends to spend some money on it for you want to keep it around  i m not worried about it at this point  i m fairly certain that the brand is damaged to the point that it might not ever be what it was at its apex  aside from some ships and a few contractual pieces of merchandise  almost none exists  and that s usually the indicator of how well one of these franchises are  it s the toys and sidelines that really made trek a cash cow over the years  it s not dead obviously  i can t bring it back and i m not trying to  and i ve made it a point never to name call or single out anyone online or in person for enjoying a tv series  it s just not that damned important  it s just a shame that a beloved franchise that shaped pop culture  influenced technology and science  and encouraged a couple of generations of people to become scientists  doctors  engineers  and even astronauts  is now just another generic series amongst a host of others

0, gt  i already addressed this  actually there s a few things i already addressed that you repeated but that s another matter if you stop repeating your arguments without giving proof and disregarding my replies i ll stop repeating my replies lol  gt  he was talking about a different situation that all had living people  not comparable  again  what makes the dead less deserving of life than the living  that s like saying the sleeping are less deserving of consciousness than the awake lol  gt  most fans agree picard best embodies the values of the federation out of any other character  so you d rather follow picard than do the right thing  picard shot ensign lynch so many times that he must have looked like swiss cheese  you want to do the same because most fans agree picard best embodies the values of the federation out of any other character  gt  so again  do you think what janeway did was in line with federation values again  did you hear what riker said to troi in her command test 
0,it s one of those things in almost all tv shows that once you start seeing you can t unsee   and it s especially jarring now with all of us having to talk to each other from opposite ends of the room   but it s just necessary for the shot   it s like in a sitcom where the room is empty but both character sit on the same side of a table or right next to each other on the couch   it s because they can t switch angles 
0,honestly i found the ending of the negotiation to be a bit odd  though the fact that an apparent diplomatic solution was happening without a main character present hinted that it wasn t going to pan out anyway so by narrative convention i guess something had to go wrong  osyraa is presenting an offer of armistice voluntarily on more or less her own terms  the chain isn t surrendering  they re essentially signing a peace treaty  asking them to submit their leadership to trial under federation law was  never  going to fly and was an obviously going to be a deal breaker  the federation simply didn t have the leverage to make it happen  vance is in a bit of a no win situation where he can make peace or bring osyraa to justice  but he can t realistically hope to do both 
0,i m glad you like it  i ve really enjoyed watching it too  and i m someone who watched all of the original star trek as a child and tng as it aired  very different from you  i remember the same type of criticisms and complaints  not the same exact complaints  but similar criticisms  of every star trek as they broadcast  i get tired of all the wet blankets putting dis down  good to hear a favorable note 
0,tngds9voyldtosdispichaven t seen ent  if the tos movies were a  series  i d have them ranked above lower decks  i prefer their tone to the tos itself 
0,dude i didn t wish you happy cake day  i m an ass
0, gt the todays problem is  that everyone is a fucking critic and the internet and reddit enables them to post their  problems  about the movies everywhere how dare other people have opinions   those unreasonable targs 
0, gt ah i felt the only time tom was a viable humanwait   what about threshold   hahaah i m sorry
0,nah  you re thinking of  the target     the wire  is the one where they find brandon s body 
0,shouldn t you judge a piece of media based on its merits rather than simply asserting you ll love it because of its lineage how about lauding that which is praise worthy and criticizing that which isn t 
0,this is a fair take  but i would say that star treks of years past people actually  liked  the stage drama style of acting    they sourced their casts from theatre actors a lot of the time   and i wouldn t exactly describe discovery acting as naturalistic    in fact i d say the tng era had more naturalistic acting  on average   characters would be calm  sedate  direct   then suddenly explode into a bombastic speech or melodramatic proclamation   it s more a question of  if everything is high stakes  nothing is  
0,garak is my absolute favorite 
0,it s so weird to me that one of the most common criticisms about star trek  09 was the lens flares   so much so that they drastically toned it down for the sequels  and that s one of the things discovery decided to make their own 
0, gt  vance is a fucking stone cold badass he is but in oded fehr delivered that line so well  we ve seen vance serious  professional  badass and caring  when he promised to make sure she got justice his stoicism slipped a little to show him pleading  just a little  really shows that underneath the composed exterior he s passionate about making the galaxy a better place 
0,i thought they were decent movies  but not good trek movies  in fact i m not sure i like any of the trek movies  and its all for similar reasons  as soon as it gets the big budgets it has to do big things    which turns them into action movies  and that makes them a different thing altogether  and i can get that from marvel  or star wars or a million other things when i watch trek  i want what the shows bring on top of that  i don t see any reason to recast the classic cast  make a different one  it doesn t do anything for me at all to rehash kirk  spock etc al tl dr   decent action movie  not what i look for when watching trek 
0,this  i believe that the d could have held its own against a couple of war birds but that was never the point  it was always about the larger ramifications of an altercation that made it tense 
0,sure  but everything else they ve trademarked early has ended up released  so viacomcbs  and cbs before it  and viacom before that  don t squat on trademarks for star trek  these are likely active projects  another new trademark is an unannounced sequel or expansion pack for one of the games  and another is an upcoming fan event that s re using  star trek  the experience  branding  the new trademark expands it to online events  
0,they ve been out on physical as well as digital services outside cbsaa for those years as well tos and tng cannot be compared  tv is simply no longer the primary medium on which people digest content  they ll go to streaming services as they have done that   2 was likely people who had seen it before 
0,if it s 150 in the tng era  how many was it in tos  i m thinking way less than that  and in that case  the federation in the 3180 s  38 worlds  is not that much smaller than it was in the time discovery left behind  am i the only one that thinks this is weird 
0,theatre isn t the best background for a screen performer they re different skills for different mediums

0,dilithium is just a power source  so are micro singularities  although they ve never explained why this wasn t a viable alternative when the burn happened book s ship uses quantum slipstream and it s not suggested that this is unusual 
0,maybe i know more mathematicians or people in the sciences  it does seem they tend to talk with less emotion  maybe more dryness 
0, gt 	i can kinda understand where all the others are coming from but i m puzzled by the  bad acting  part  gt  gt 	i m no professional tv critic but i just fail to see anything straight up bad about the acting in dis  yes  tng and ds9 had better actingso  i will say discovery has frequent bouts of bad writing but acting  i don t see that  sure  i think a lot of emotional moments feel unearned  but that s probably the writing  not the acting as for tng  especially in its early seasons  it has some pretty bad acting  excessive use of gestures as if they re on a theater stage  not a starship set 
0,all of captain proton can fuck off

0,they aren t three years old to the audiences who never purchase an aa subscription  i grant they weren t likely to be the top of the stack  but it was beat out in that time slot by some real stinkers  and we all know that in the past star trek did well in syndication for years after its broadcast  that s were tos got a new lease on life  discovery isn t rewatchable  and i think aa would have had to rebrand in any case  and i m not even sure that branding it paramount   will help it in the streaming wars  i think it s just going to be a losing brand  that s conjecture on my part or a prediction if you will 
0,yep absolutely loathe it 
0,and far beyond the stars  ds9 hit so many episodes right out of the park 
0,too bad they didn t add screenshots production photos to the end credits like in tos 
0,yes  i wish they would make michael s character tougher  it s ludicrous how much she cries  i like pretty much everything else about the series  barring some of the 1st season 
0,ah i felt the only time tom was a viable human was when he was with kim  anytime he was anywhere else with anyone else  i prayed that he was being lead out an air lock

0,i never could stand bakula s acting in enterprise  he always seemed angry and sarcastic  i much preferred shatner s sparkle of humor and charm or  of course  patrick stewart s thoughtful delivery 
0,it s a great episode but i d put it more in the fan service category    yeah fan service done almost perfectly but it s more or less a episode for trekkies while some episodes can stand on their own right
0,all access is being rebranded because cbs is back sith paramount now and paramount has a much stronger global presence cbs isn t really known outside the us as for discovery  i assume you re referring to the tv reruns in 2020 showing 3 year old episodes that were accessible digitally and physically for years you state yourself disco costs  8m an episode tng r cost 12 million total and they didn t do ds9 because it didn t make enough do you really think that discovery is failing behind the scenes when they ve just confirmed another full 13 episode order 
0,if i was still mad about directorial choices made in a sci fi movie 12 years after it came out i d throw myself off a bridge for wasting my life 
0,my dear doctor  they re all true even the lies especially the lies 
0,kira could take both of them 
0,you also though start to enter into the idea that is anyone in the romulan hierarchy truly innocent  the quite literally cut throat nature of romulan power dynamics means that in all likelihood  she ll have done many unsavory acts herself to gain such a high position  not what i d call an innocent woman  the innocent label was for that specific crime  which i grant bashir was correct on and from a starfleet intelligence perspective  he got a federation agent in as the head of the tal shiar and on the continuing committee  starfleet has an intelligence branch separate from 31  and they d have sure been chomping at the bit to have an agent in koval s place as well  so it being 31 specifically doesn t change that mainline intelligence likely would have done the same as it furthers federation interests 
0,great answer  i forgot about that episode in ds9  i ll be sure to hunt it down and watch it also i do agree with your point about the federation not wanting to develop a weapon purely for killing  i mean  i m pretty sure that s why they never fully finished developing the defiant class  because it was a pure warship 
0,don t forget inter arma enim silent leges
0, gt 	again  did you hear what riker said to troi on her command test  if it wasn t federation values why would they hammer it into commanders like that i already addressed this  actually there s a few things i already addressed that you repeated but that s another matter    he was talking about a different situation that all had living people  not comparable   gt 	plus  who cares what picard would do  don t you want to do what s right rather than mimic what someone else would do most fans agree picard best embodies the values of the federation out of any other character  so again  do you think what janeway did was in line with federation values 
0,i think ross is  at best   neutral   if he is either  from the statistics or switched to bad  ds9 s  badmiral  proportion actually becomes  higher  than tng s  even if there are fewer total occurrences i feel i should also point out that picard s resignation was a threat intended to facilitate the evacuation of romulus  but command called his bluff  bad is at least an overstatement here

0,many of the whiners blame the show for being  woke  because it has some african americans  homosexuals  aliens and asians instead of the traditional caucasian cast  they call this an  sjw  agenda  but i never understood what this  agenda  is about  is it an evil plan to show that 88 75  of the planet s population is composed of other ethnic groups  as i said  if they are going to criticize discovery  they should base it on how many of the writers lack proper lore knowledge and believe that adding a planet s name or an alien species compensates for whatever obvious details they ignored  rebooted or simply forgot  they can criticize the fact that instead of focusing on the crew  michael always saves the day  lower decks does a better job at being star trek than discovery  heck  the show could have been called discovery and instead of using the franchise s name and assets  they could have been part of some spatial agency operating within an  astral coalition of worlds  and it would receive a lot less criticism than it does

0,shut the fuck up
0,uss titan  the fact that it s a  deep  space exploration ship  in one book it s thousands of light years beyond federation space  would bring a unique blend of tng and voyager stories and themes  you d have the exploration aspect of the former combined with the  we re alone out here  nature of the latter it also has a highly diverse crew which would be easier to show on screen now than any trek back in the 90s  that would only be a good thing for the franchise to flesh out the diversity of the federation beyond humans 
0,i love both of them 
0,so it s not so much that the old shows aren t good  or that people shouldn t like them  it s that tng premiered in 1987  television has changed a lot in that time  and when people throw screaming tantrums on this subreddit and many others every time the new star trek isn t just like the old ones  it s exhausting  times change  audience tastes change  should they maybe try making another series more in the vein of 90s trek  sure  why not  but i guarantee you those same people who complain about lens flare will still hate it  because that s what they do  they begged for a series set after nemesis for years but hated picard  they whined about how much better pike and spock were than the regular discovery cast but i guarantee they ll hate strange new worlds  star trek fans are bitter and angry  and they hate star trek

0,you don t have discuss anything should you not wish it  i m not twisting your arm here  but i m not gatekeeping star trek  i countered the claim that the kirk rebel backstory was explored  i gave details disputing the claim  into darkness wasn t well received but the others were  i don t see what that has to do with anything  it s akin to measuring 2009 as successful star trek because it was a profitable movie  i didn t make star trek but it s core and what it is are defined by tos  just like hershey s special dark or milk chocolate bar are determined by what came first  they own the trademark so they can change the formula  same with trek  but you can lose your audience along the way and that s what happened  the studio pushed nutrek  beyond cost about 85 million dollars in losses and the prospect for film number four are practically gone  nutrek series cost around 8million per episode  but all access failed to survive in its first iteration and when discovery was launched on tv with a  2 demo rating  i m not gatekeeping anything  the op asked why the movies were held in negative regard by fans  i gave a response to this thread  and i m gatekeeping nothing  into darkness was so bad that it killed interest in star trek movies  that s on abrams  kurtzman  et al  i have nothing to do with this disaster 
0,sg1 
0, gt  do you genuinely think what janeway did was in line with federation values  like forget if you personally agree with her   do you think it s actually consistent with what st normally preaches again  did you hear what riker said to troi on her command test  if it wasn t federation values why would they hammer it into commanders like that  gt  can you see picard doing this i would think he probably got the same message on his command test  so he should have done it lol  plus  who cares what picard would do  don t you want to do what s right rather than mimic what someone else would do 
0,george lucas made the prequel trilogy too   just because you did the original doesn t necessarily mean you can recapture the same lightning in a bottle every time   if you liked it though that s fine   there s no shortage of alternative examples of poorly executed reboots to prove my point lol

0,ahh good point 
0,i had no idea  i remember watching old clark gable movies in syndication back in the 1970s  those actresses certainly were acting their tails off  because i don t think anyone would have guessed that about gable 
0,so i read this somewhat frequently  but i don t really see why having a style of show you like is something that is bad  i also don t know why there s this idea that 90s trek couldn t get new audiences   there s plenty of people in this subreddit talking about watching them for the first time  i also think there s plenty of people who don t like  stupid  movies  not that they don t like  fun  movies  for fans who like a particular show  you can eventually change it enough that it s not that show anymore  this isn t being rigid  it s just eventually the thing kind of becomes something else  for example  sherlock holmes fans may have been fine with the bbc sherlock  it asked  what if sherlock holmes was modern  then they might have also liked elementary  but that was quite a change  they were in nyc rather than london  they were modern  and watson was a woman who was an addiction counselor  i still accepted it as a pretty good sherlock holmes show  then there s house  many people say it s another spin on sherlock holmes  and maybe it is in a loose sense  but the main character is a doctor  not a detective  it s in the us  not london  it s modern  there isn t a  watson  per se  it s a medical mystery show with as much in common with grey s anatomy as with the original sherlock holmes  and i needed it pointed out to me that house was holmes  i can certainly see people saying  house is a good show  but it s not sherlock holmes

0,the compassion is what i most appreciate about star trek  the sheer love and respect for all life  and doing as much as possible to help and understand 
0,yes  well  i m speaking from an in universe perspective  from the outside perspective  i d say that the writers utterly failed to adequately describe a believable and fulfilling climax to the episode
0,the biggest problem with the kelvinverse films are the same problem jj s star wars films have  they are made by someone who seems to have only a surface understanding of the previous material jj abrams takes the trappings of both franchises and throws them in a blender and wraps them in a mystery box and says it s definitely not what you think it is   it is   he then throws a fresh coat of paint on it  and pretends that it s deeper than it looks   it isn t   jj abrams should never be allowed near another iconic franchise again that said with star trek 09 we wouldn t have renewed interest in the franchise  and most likely wouldn t have nutrek  regardless of what anyone thinks about it  positive or negative   this isn t the thread for it i do enjoy the movies  and think beyond is the best and most  treklike  of the 3  i include them when i do a biennial binge   which i think i m due for   i place them between enterprise and discovery 
0,man before i get into addressing all of these points  because you have some serious hot takes here  i have to ask  do you genuinely think what janeway did was in line with federation values  like forget if you  personally  agree with her   do you think it s actually consistent with what st normally preaches  can you see picard doing this 
0,  kathryn bigelow for some exploration of deeper morality themes  via some really good tense action    paul thomas anderson for a intellectual character driven story   darren aronofsky for full on  frame of mind  esque wtf ness   wes anderson because somehow in 3d space the ships always seem to end up face to face on the same plane  so why not go fully symmetrical

0,i ll add another upvote  i wasn t thrilled with the first season of dis but found it intriguing  i loved season 2 and mostly like season 3  just watched episode 12 and ejoyed the hell out of it  i came here to see if i could find anyone else who likes it  i m so tired of people bashing it just because it s not like tng or ds9  i do wish michael wouldn t cry so much  but that s just something to laugh about now and then and doesn t affect my enjoyment  even though others complain that dis is the michael burnham show  i see a lot of character development of the rest of the crew  much more than in tos  thanks again for the positive words 
0,they all well received though   you don t like it   you are kind of gatekeeping trek here  and i m not furthering this conversation  i m sorry

0,the  dramatic fast tempo whisper speak  is such an annoying affectation  sisko s wide mouthed yelling was bad as well though at least one could argue that he s the captain and needs to convey authority over everyone else  i m not sure where it started but the entire whisper speak stuff has become more and more prevalent in general  i notice it in films  tv shows  etc  it s not even true to life  in real life people speak in a clear and distinct way that can be understood  why would directors and actors doing it any differently

0,yes   lesser sage
0,i still think we are talking about different things here   tng in the 90 s still adhears to it s own internal logic  as does the original series  i can t state this enough  i am not talking about whimsy fantasy  or  magical  concepts 
0, gt smg is an absolutely terrific actor  but the writers continue to shove her character into over the top  hyper flag waving situations where she has to over emote to the point of exhaustion is she  her delivery was the exact same in the walking dead  her performance looks very contrived  not natural at all  the way she oscillates between stoic and dour to hyperemotional is jarring and it s not just present in discovery  either she s been typecast  hard  very early in her career or she s not as strong an actress as people claim 
0,he didn t explore that  as a boy he steals an antique car and drives it over the cliff  it s reckless and we have no idea why  because his dad died  that happens to people everyday and they don t act this way  what did his stepdad do to deserve this  did he beat the kids  did he abusive the mom  did he diddle kirk in someway  he s just acting out to make it look cool on screen and to establish that nukirk is a rebel  but it explores nothing  that s one of the downsides to nutrek  the writers have an end point in mind and the characters just run that direction and it s rarely explored or explained   there are tons of narrative shortcuts that undermine the characters and the story that they are trying to tell  and what makes nutrek also bad is that no one thought about the destruction of romulus in the prime timeline  2009 should have been entirely separate in the event the movie is a train wreck and they need to dump it  surprise it s a wreck  just as discovery and picard  and lower decks  there should be a way to dump it and start over from nemesis 
0,discovery is my first star trek series  i ve never really watched or gotten into much of the star trek universe before this  but i m really enjoying discovery

0,detachable nacelles and programmable matter  but ship names are still illuminated by spotlights on the hull 
0,i don t think the acting is that bad  certainly i ve seen worse on tv and in st  i think the problem is the writing and directing  kind of repeating everyone else here   i don t know smg from anything else  but to have burnham written as a human trying to be a vulcan yet regularly switching to someone undergoing a manic episode or something     smg might be  acting  it exactly as written and directed  but it  plays  like a plank of wood mixed with someone off their meds  i think people misattribute this to bad acting 
0,uh    yes  that s the reason  inflation  we ll go with that 
0, gt  bad writing  bad acting  i m a homophobe and a transphobe  i hate emotions  whispering and female heroes way to try to understand the other side  people don t criticize discovery for depicting emotions  they criticize it for being  melodrama   crying is fine  sisko does it  jake does it  picard does it  7of9 does it  once in a great while  having the protagonist cry in virtually every episode is  sensationalism   and that s bad writing

0,misquote me all you want  we can have this convo in my native language and we ll see how you do  this would be enough for me to dismiss you as unworthy of any arguments but i ll indulge you  this show is an unforgivable mess  it being unreasonably centered on one  and only one  very badly written character is just a tiny part of it  whoever writes it seems to be completely allergic to logic and coherence  there is a major mistake or plot hole every few minutes  no other st show has ever been this bad 
0,i do like the show  and i m not being mean edit  are you the joker that has reported me to suicide watch on reddit  because i don t find that shit funny in the slightest  you have no idea what people s personal history with suicide is  it isn t your fucking punchline  scumbag 
0, gt  garr is a rare trek guest star who has outright bashed the show and its fans huh   i ve been a st fan for well over 40 years  and had no idea about that   bummer   but you re probably right 
0,you can easily tell the frakes episodes  they re generally the best by far 
0,absolutely a good point  and which most people don t get  they re not trying to be ableist  but automatically assume being as they or most people  2 seeing eyes  2 hearing ears etc  is what anyone should want  if you never had hearing or seeing as others  and unless they make you think believe something is wrong with you if you don t     i  e  they have issues with your difference   i say this as a deaf hoh person who also chose no cochlear implants  for many many deaf persons  its not a condition  it s an entire culture  your point is also one hearing parents who have a child with deafness but force them to have implants instead of waiting for them to choose or who force them into language schools  forcing them to speak verbally  always looking at it from their abled view of what they think of as lacking or absent because they cannot comprehend  instead of understanding  seeing    hearing  or experiencing are accomplished different ways

0,i was three years old when ds9 was finished  and my parents didn t let me watch with them when they went through tng  ds9 and voy because they thought i was too young  it s rated 12 in germany and they were very strict with this  i believe the fact that i confused the dominion with the romulans is evidence enough of that  it s barely a spoiler  though  so no worries 
0,i m really surprised that vance hasn t assigned at least a few of his starfleet personnel to the discovery 
0, gt teri garr may have been locked into that for several years garr is a rare trek guest star who has outright bashed the show and its fans  i bet she s unhappy she was cast at all 
0,it s a decidedly anomalous episode due to its backdoor pilot status  nonetheless gary seven has appeared in a few novels and comics  so some of that has probably been fleshed out there 
0,i m another one that loves the first couple seasons of ds9   i found them pretty much perfect 
0,smg is an acting gymnast here  with writing that is suffering from janeway level switch flipping doug jones has been a treasure  legitimately the best presence on the show michelle yeoh has worked very well with what one dimension writing she s been given mary wiseman has matured and moved out of the manic pixie of earlier seasons and developed a likable and strong character anthony rapp and wilson cruz have developed the best relationship in star trek ever but the writing has been inconsistent at best and downright horrible at its worst  they ve ignored good canon materials when they had the ability to easily incorporate it into the story  and found obscure nods to canon that just work  i really feel like the writing staff has held the entire series back and i agree with the tell not show plot design which really hurts the production of this show  i ll keep watching it for the moments of acting brilliance  but i m getting discouraged by how the show gets presented  like in one of the recent episodes  they had a flashback to blatantly spell out one of the minor baddy was returning   which completely destroyed any impact of the character coming back  i want to enjoy it  but it s general poor writing is slowly dropping towards my least favourite treks 
0,i liked them for what they were  i didn t expect them to be exactly like other trek and i wasn t disappointed   the only thing i truly found annoying is they decided to play  cool  music over dialog and even with captions it was a mess trying to keep up 
0, gt the borg would have adapted to that weapon eventually likely very quickly too  forcefields blocking solid objects are clearly seen all over the show  any time they erect one in a corridor to block an intruder  or throw someone in the brig  it s demonstrably easier technology to build a force field to stop solid objects than it is to build one that can optimize itself on the fly to deflect a specific type and pattern of energy 
0,that wasn t bad pr  everyone cheered because it still meant he had an incredibly sought after rank  and all other charges were dropped  he literally stole an incredibly iconic starship and blew it up it was a punishment in name only  kirk wouldn t have been happier if they said  all charges are dropped  demoting a captain to commander means she likely wouldn t command anything significant again  she d be stuck as a number 1 until she quit  kirk gets to carry on doing the exact same shit he did in tos 
0,i figure at least three years
0,there s a certain segment of star trek fans that only like the version of trek that they first watched in their formative years   everything else that follows pales in comparison and is never given a chance or appreciated for what it is 
0,and me  i d add that i ve really been enjoying the writing and the show as a whole  disco has also been the first trek that s appealed to my wife  she s seen bits and pieces of every series   even tas   over the last decade   now we can enjoy fresh trek together  it s been a gift 
0, gt  every extra long range scanner that a science vessel would profit from is a phaser bank missing in combat exactly  this leads onto a tangential point about why starfleet doesn t use certain military technologies that other powers do  like cloaking devices  yes they have arms treaties where they agreed not to develop them but beyond that a cloaking device  like everything  has an opportunity cost  that s one less sensor  one less phaser array  one less replimat etc also apologies if that was a spoiler for you re the dominion  i missed your comment elsewhere in thread about having not finished ds9 yet  i tend to forget that not everyone watched it when it was on tv  p
0, gt  i can t think of any other cast member whose acting takes me out of the moment  not even tig notaro  she s not an actor and it really shows imo  i ve played d amp d with people who have better line delivery 
0,weirdest program   i can t imagine   but definitely barkley i had  actually still have  in a box  the star trek wall calendar that came out for 1991  when i was a wee lad of 22    the picture for one month was the ladies in their barkley holodeck garb   i just stopped changing the months at that point 
0,i think  in the pale moonlight  is the best episode of all trek series    the wire  is merely an excellent episode 
0, gt  your main point always comes back to murder being okay nope  i m saying your main point always comes back to it being ok to kill tuvok and neelix and that s not ok lol  why do you want to kill tuvok and neelix  gt  tuvix was a freak accident and somehow it s ok to treat him like a datapad being resequenced in a replicator because you want something else and you want to treat tuvok and neelix like datapads just because you like tuvix  gt  it would suck not having tuvok or neelix ever again but i just don t see how anyone has the right to make these godlike decisions at the expense of another s life when they make it clear they don t want to sacrifice themselves  which is their right yet you want to make godlike decisions to kill tuvok and neelix when they also have the right not to sacrifice themselves   why do you dislike tuvok and neelix so much  gt  accidents happen  and it can really  really suck  this murder wasn t an accident  what about being an accident removes tuvok and neelix s right to live  that s like saying people who accidentally fall asleep don t have the right to consciousness lol  gt  tuvix was stripped of his inalienable rights what about tuvok and neelix s inalienable rights 
0, gt i d like to see more of her  some flashbacks in starfleet  in the maquis  how and what made b elanna  b elanna well for the starfleet thing janeway makes reference to a professor chapman in  parallax  who would ve been one of b elanna s supporters if she reapplied to the academy  there are also few scattered references to b elanna s academy days throughout the series and we saw some of the maquis dealings in  hunters   amp   extreme risk   with both b elanna and chakotay dealing with the death of the maquis
0,there is bad acting  but certainly no worse that other star trek and often considerably better  however  there is so much melodramatic shite that the actors have to work with  my wife and i take bets on how many characters will cry each episode  it s always at least one  often two or three  that can easily come across as fault of the actors  when michael is again crying or screaming because shits happened  we think  not a fucking gain  stop whining and get on with it    rather than feel any empathy towards her  it s more an issue around the writing and characters  than the actors themselves

0,i loved the voyage home  too  partially because they didn t take themselves seriously  like  at all but the abrahms films took themselves seriously 
0,no one makes this complaint about picard   the show is focused on one character as well   you don t hear anyone crying for an elnor episode 
0,i haven t heard that saying from the romulans so far  i m looking forward to seeing more of them  but what you ve addressed certainly rings true  the previous discussions had me remember an  gt  instance in voyager season 3 s scorpion i amp ii when the crew of the voyager is able to find a solution to a threat the borg despite their far superior firepower are unable to handle  thus proving the scientific superiority of the federation which usually doesn t have a chance to shine in armed conflicts   lt  i completely agree with you that it is plausible for the federation to design their spaceships as multi purpose vessels  i ve also been informed that in later tng episodes and in ds9  the federation begins to increasingly arm itself with new dedicated warships in response to new threats  also  with all this future technology it is easy to forget that the capabilities of a starship will still be limited  i e  every extra long range scanner that a science vessel would profit from is a phaser bank missing in combat  a spaceship likely cannot both be as powerful as a specialized ship such as a warbird while also performing the duties of a science vessel  thanks a lot for your comment  it has helped ease my discomfort over something that has always bothered me  i don t like fabricated threats for the purpose of having a threat but it seems the difference in power between romulan and federation ships isn t so fabricated after all 
0,that episode was supposed to be an intro into a spin off series   but it never happened i assume the series would have delved more into why they were helping protect humanity from itself maybe it is best that the series never happened   teri garr may have been locked into that for several years  and then she wouldn t have done all the comedy she ended up doing  and   gasp  may not have been in young frankenstein 
0,lets detonate this cold bomb in the volcano  but we cant let the indigenous tribes people see the ship as it would be a violation of the prime directive  even though the cold bomb interferes with the natural development of the planet and a much bigger violation  plus  whats the cold bomb really doing   either its freezing all hot magma down to the core  which dooms the planet in days because molten iron cores are needed to generate a magnetic sphere that protects against local suns radiation   or it merely freezes up a regional pocket of magma  in which the magma that didnt freeze will slowly build up and eventually blow  making the current eruption look like a school project

0,it was 
0, gt i generally agree with your other points  so i didn t see a need to respond to them  btw  i have only 1 issue with kelvin kirk  his incredibly quick promotion from cadet to captain it was quick yes  problem it s a movie not episodic 
0,it s not handwaving  if you weren t there then the train would run and kill five people  it s a condition that exists  tuvix was also a random convergence that produced tuvix  had janeway not acted  tuvix would have continued ahead  once you decide to intervene you are acting on the outcome  the same way that as you observe something you ve changed it  you can dislike the outcome and you can reason the utilitarian perspective and choose to save  five people  while condemning one  but you chose to step in and change and event that would have continued whether or not you intervened it is the ethical conundrum of the external actor  but it isn t handwaving anymore than a tree falling in the forest or a tornado touching down  time as we know it marches on and things happen  if you think it s more moral as an external actor to play god and choose who lives and dies  you can make that argument  a nihilist would argue that it doesn t matter  it s not a right or wrong per se  but you are responsible the moment that you take an action that changes events that are already in motion  tuvix was the same example  she could act to save tuvok and neelix at the expense of tuvix or she could leave tuvix alive as random chance had already acted upon tuvok and neelix  she took a utilitarian approach to her choice  i might have done the same  but it has to be done knowing that she did have to actively kill tuvix  she had to order him to his death  just as switching the track would be acting to murder a single individual in the train experiment  you ve gone from passive observer to active murderer  not handwaving  despite the justification that is what happens when direct action applies 
0, gt  lens flares  gt   gt  yep   i ve tried to start the trilogy several times  but it was just so damned distracting and over the top that it s impossible to focus on much of what is going on  this is  of course  setting aside the bizarre tonal shifts in the plot    my favorite example is at the end of the movie  it s supposed to show the crew together on the bridge   at last   except for the lens flare is so severe  it blots out sulu and mccoy  i believe 
0, gt  exception  enterprise ending no idea what you mean  though i m glad lower decks took a poke at that  
0,how exactly would they build a fleet in secret and still have legitimacy as a democracy  you say the idea is that this society is a utopia like the federation  presumably you mean that it s a place that values personal freedoms and collective responsibility  has a well functioning democracy  and has common ownership of the economy  if that s the case then how can this secession movement be a secret for that plan to work either every citizen in the region has to in on it  meaning you somehow have to organise a secret vote and get the electorate to keep the outcome a secret  regardless of if they voted  remain   or some clandestine group has to build a military in preparation for secession  the former is impossible  the latter isn t utopia 
0,or  if janeway was  really  that dedicated  voyager could have used the array while she stayed behind in a shuttle loaded down with antimatter explosives to ensure it was destroyed  janeways character was borderline assassinated from the jump and the showrunners refusal to have even basic episode to episode continuity just ensured she could never really recover  i sometimes wish we could peek into our own alternate universe where voyager and enterprise both got made without bnb being in charge  just to see what could have been 
0,i m glad to see you ve said this  i finally took the plunge and started watching ds9 a few weeks ago  there are some bangers but also some episodes i feel halfway through i should skip due to how little i care about them  good to know it s just a bit hit or miss 
0,star trek fans gonna hate      „ÉÑ   
0,they largely felt more like  independence day  than a trek story and had questionable uses of already then dated effects and music trends  lens flares  pop music used as a plot device  etc   but the worst offender was the excruciatingly contrived screenplay and cartoon moustache villain motivations of the antagonists in  into darkness   not to mention casting benedict cumberbatch as a sikh augment in one of the most predictable and least effective twists in 21st century cinema  so far   beyond was fun though  and i do have a soft spot for 2009  despite its flaws  but goddamn  that score  the music in all three movies is absolutely sublime 
0, gt  i never saw the third onethe third one is actually the best of the three 
0, gt but then what was the point of making them maquis if they never explored it that s a good question  they should ve done more exploration of the maquis members who d never been in starfleet  it s a major weakness of  voyager  
0, we are no longer capable of such thinking  
0,you ve just got to have gone to school to have realised this 
0,it should be noted that a lot of people hated voyager and star trek 3  and star trek 4 was very much a parody of itself as for kirk  when he was young  the film opens with child kirk careening around in a stolen car  and pike describes him as a regular screw up and while the lens flares have zero to do with the story  they do have to do with the quality of the overall enjoyment experience 
0, gt mad maxyou mean the extremely critically well recieved fury road that was made by the creator of the original films 
0,urgency is not an emotion
0,star trek uses technology to eliminate or mitigate the disability which is the correct way for optimistic sci fi to deal with disabilities as spock would put it   to change the enterprise in order to accommodate a situation that could be remedied by federation science would be illogical  
0,just watched tng  pegasus   riker was part of a cover up in developing illegal cloaking technology that violated  a treay with the romulans  he should have been punished in someway for atleast lying   also forgotten in the next episode 
0,your main point always comes back to murder being okay  tuvix was a freak accident and somehow it s ok to treat him like a datapad being resequenced in a replicator because you want something else  it would suck not having tuvok or neelix ever again but i just don t see how anyone has the right to make these godlike decisions at the expense of another s life when they make it clear they don t want to sacrifice themselves   which is their right  accidents happen  and it can really  really suck  this murder wasn t an accident  tuvix was stripped of his inalienable rights 
0,i like the nana visitor too 
0,the fight choreography this season has been terrible  that leg move was just dumb 
0,probably tng  right  it would familiarize them with pretty much every trope  trapping  virtue  vice  and characteristic of trek in the broadest sense  i think 
0, gt 	so  janeway had to pick between tuvok and neelix and tuvix   no she didn t  that s the point  they were already dead  she wanted to murder a living being to resurrect two others  it s not comparable   gt 	so you re saying a persons right to live comes from their ability to march and their ability to plead for their lives  what if they re asleep  you re saying they have no right to live you re dwelling way too much on the  plead for their lives  bit and missing my actual point   gt 	so you re saying a person s right to live stems from destiny no  star trek is saying that  whether or not they deserve to live is a separate debate  but the point is you can t compare these situations as they re very   very  different with different ethics and moral messages behind them   gt 	so  what about being dead and no longer existing makes someone less deserving of life  that s like saying asleep people are less deserving of consciousness loit s not like saying that because unconscious people are still alive  my point is that these two people died because of a transporter accident  no fault of anyone s   it was an accident  and they re gone  tuvix  on the other hand  is alive and breathing and innocent  their rights are not being violated from being dead  his are by being executed for doing nothing wrong    gt 	isn t resurrecting them freeing them from the prison of death no  because there s no such thing  being dead isn t being in a prison  it s being dead and not experiencing anything   gt 	were tuvok and neelix not both innocent and deserving of protection they were dead  they didn t need protection because there was nothing to protect them from  there was no  them   no tuvix  no neelix  you can t compare living and dead people and give them the same rights all i have to end this on is wwpd  what would picard do  because i know picard would not march an innocent man to his execution while he begs for his life

0, r thatsabooklight
0,the problem with this is the one of history  a society who believe they are the best thing available coming in and acting as they think is best is one we have experience of that s why the federation has the pd  not because of the impact on the race being helped  but the impact on the federation  the federation becomes responsible for them  as it was their involvement that created the situation  you save them from a asteroid  will you save them from nuclear armageddon  it creates a ton of debate amongst this new federation about what next  the pd gives the federation an exit  if you don t get involved  then there s nothing that can be debated unless this  utopian  society has no qualms with the likelihood of fucking over younger species  then they ll end up in a situation full of internal conflict of either justifying why it s okay to save some people and not others  or they end up trying to save everyone and ignoring their own people 
0,but then what was the point of making them maquis if they never explored it  they could have just made the first episode where they are all star fleet exploring a nebula  it s just funny when he lectures janeway on starfleet morales without acknowledging he was a terrorist who went against star fleet 
0,given the different fate of his dad  kelvin kirk s differences make sense to me  i have more of a problem with kelvin spock being overly emotional 
0,the lens flare is still there  seriously  something bad being 12 years old doesn t make it less bad  it s still bad  for the same reasons  and if someone starts a thread asking  why is this thing bad  people will respond with those reasons  spock s brain is over 50 years old  and if someone starts a thread asking  why don t people like spock s brain   people are going to discuss the things about it they don t like  which are mostly the same things they didn t like about it 50 years ago btw  i do want fun movies  but i also want them to be good movies with interesting characters  a well thought out setting  and a good plot  how can a movie even be fun if it doesn t check those boxes 
0,well  the beauty of yulin s performance is that  if you see him in other works  he s almost always much quieter and more reserved in his acting style  nothing super theatrical  but he dialed it up in  duet   precisely because that s how maritza saw gul dar heel  and how he felt he needed to act to bring the bajorans down on him  it s unclear who dar heel was in life  or whether maritza accurately portrayed him  i d suspect not  but because of how much loathing maritza had  both for himself and for dar heel  as well as  tacitly  how broken the cardassian system of justice  which exists to demonstrate the infallibility and supremacy of the cardassian state rather than to determine guilt or innocence  had rendered maritza  he opted for a wildly over the top performance  just to make himself seem even more despicable and it almost worked  even though his plan is completely crazy  it almost worked 
0,all replicators function that way 
0, gt  there are so many trek episodes where they find some new life form and discover it s sentient  so they feed it  protect it  try to communicate with it  etc  but here janeway is speaking face to face with a humanoid with a full range of emotions  hopes  desires  and she s just like   you re a bargaining chip in my gamble with fate  are tuvok and neelix not both  humanoid s  with a full range of emotions  hopes  desires  or are you saying they re both just bargaining chips to save tuvix  gt  if janeway had stuck to federation principles there wouldn t have even been a discussion about how tuvix came to be  or at what cost  what matters is his sovereignty over his own life  but because she lost friends and crew in the process now her principles don t matter what about the sovereignty of both tuvok and neelix  did tuvox steal their sovereignty  lol gt  was it right to let tuvok and neelix die not when you can bring them back  gt   if you honor what they fight for  yes     yoda  the empire strikes backthis was from yoda arguing to kill people for the greater good  so yoda agrees with me  thanks for bringing that up 
0,he literally cheated on the kobiyashi maru test  nuanced my butt   in both universes cheating on a test because you don t agree with it  is rebellious behavior 
0,starfleet serves in the capacity of the federation s military but it is not primarily a military institution  it s mandate also covers scientific research and diplomatic out reach  consequently their ships are designed to be multi role  you could certainly make the argument that this is not a good idea  and that even peace loving societies should have a dedicated military  but that doesn t make it implausible by contrast comparable powers like the klingons  romulans  cardassians etc have dedicated militaries  a bird of prey is not spending its time seeking out strange new worlds  if it s not fighting it s patrolling  this is why starfleet can often be outperformed when it comes to fighting where they make up for it is that their peaceful  multicultural society is richer and enjoys faster scientific progress  there s a reason the dominion military has a healthy respect for starfleet engineers  going so far as to quip they can turn  rocks into replicators  
0,okay   but i don t see an issue with what happened on kelvin timeline   and what about my other points  you won t gaslight me my friend he also cheated on the kobiyashi maru test

0,i m not sure if quinto or the writers  or both  caused the problems i have with kelvin spock  thoughtful deliberation and negotiation aren t present in most  star trek  films 
0,there was an episode where she was trapped in a crashed shuttle midway through the show and most of it focused on her kid worrying about it she was rescued at the end of it  but the writers thought they d killed her off and didn t include her in any scripts until someone pointed out their mistake in season 7

0,andrew robinson  harris yulin  and tony todd were were the reasons why  they crushed it   the visitor was tony todd getting a chance to take off the makeup and act without a tough guy persona   while robinson and yulin got to put on some makeup and really go as over the top melodramatic as possible  the give the series regulars something meaty to chew on  stellar work from actors  writers  and directors   one additional note  i think old jake sisko s home is one of the most comfortable sets i ve ever seen  i want to spend a week living there

0, gt  for the riker situation he was saying you might have to pick between people to save  so  janeway had to pick between tuvok and neelix and tuvix    gt  that s very different to marching a person an innocent off to their execution while they plead for their lives so you re saying a persons right to live comes from their ability to march and their ability to plead for their lives  what if they re asleep  you re saying they have no right to live  gt  as for edith keeler  the point there was that she was destined to die  and saving her might alter the timeline  there was no implication of that with tuvix  so you re saying a person s right to live stems from destiny  who decides what destiny is  wasn t mccoy going back in time to save keeler also destiny  why are you forgetting that destiny but remembering the other destiny  gt  for all intents and purposes  they were already dead  they no longer had rights  because they no longer existed so  what about being dead and no longer existing makes someone less deserving of life  that s like saying asleep people are less deserving of consciousness lol  gt  what happened at the end of that episode wasn t freeing them from some prison  it was resurrecting them by murdering someone elseisn t resurrecting them freeing them from the prison of death  gt  someone innocent who deserved protection were tuvok and neelix not both innocent and deserving of protection

0, gt we have no idea the type of person  kirk was when he was younger  but based on his attitude  he seemed like a  rebel  and i am glad jj explored that he was a walking stack of books according to those who knew him  a real taskmaster  his only act of rebellion was reprogramming the kobayashi maru  because he didn t believe in the utility of the test  it was a little protest  and the academy liked it enough to give him a commendation he was also deeply affected by the tarsus massacre  a wound that should have been fresher in his academy days  though i suppose jj wiped that from continuity through his experiences in the service and with the influence of his friends  he matured into a person with a nuanced view of duty  in his old age  he risked his career and reputation to do what he thought was right  but always in the service of others  and only after trying to do things through official channels  and he always came back so he could be held to account for his actions he was never a rebel

0,honestly  i think that most of the critiques against the acting are  actually  against the  writing  and  directing   the cast of dis are all very fine actors  and they re all doing a terrific job with the low grade written material that they re being given smg is an absolutely terrific actor  but the writers continue to shove her character into over the top  hyper flag waving situations where she has to over emote to the point of exhaustion dis s biggest flaw is that the writers constantly invert the rule of  show  don t tell   virtually every encounter between the characters of discovery is one of emotional exposition instead of actually living their virtues and  doing  their character arcs  it s all being spelled out instead of witnessed  this gets grating almost immediately in any story  be it tv  movie  or written word  but seriously  when the cast is given the chance to escape the lazy confines of the bad writing they re constantly handed  they absolutely shine  that scene with burnham in s3 ep1 with the truth serum that made her go bonkers  amazing  stamets burnham s interaction in s3 ep 12  absolutely incredible  burnham and spock in  if memory serves  were fantastic  vance and osyraa in this last ep  magnetic  when it works  it works  the problem is that it s almost never allowed to 
0,laforge s program where he has a weird 3 way with a pair of bynars
0,oh no people dont agree with me they must be bigots 
0,there are so many trek episodes where they find some new life form and discover it s sentient  so they feed it  protect it  try to communicate with it  etc  but here janeway is speaking face to face with a humanoid with a full range of emotions  hopes  desires  and she s just like   you re a bargaining chip in my gamble with fate  if janeway had stuck to federation principles there wouldn t have even been a discussion about how tuvix came to be  or at what cost  what matters is his sovereignty over his own life  but because she lost friends and crew in the process now her principles don t matter was it right to let tuvok and neelix die  if you honor what they fight for  yes     yoda  the empire strikes back
0,can t violate something that hadn t existed yet
0,his aaaaaassssssets
0,it s basically star trek in name only  if you watched a bit of the old shows  they re extremely different 
0,resources aren t infinite  if a handful of planets separated from the federation they now only have access to the resources of a handful of planets  the fleet they re able to build is not going to be large  or as sophisticated whatever 10 planets can do 150 planets can do more  and better  economies of scale didn t become obsolete  
0,one of the most infuriating episodes in all of trek  voyager missed their chance to get home trivially easily because they couldn t manage to keep 2 ferengi from   escaping their quarters  taking out their guards  making it all the way to the shuttlebay  opening the shuttlebay  launching their shuttleafter that  every security officer on the ship should ve handed in their badge and spent the rest of the trip home locked in their quarters considering their insurmountable failure and the casualties it resulted in
0,shout out to oded fehr   mvp of this episode 
0,that was hilarious 
0,at some point in the tng  the person that plays nelix played a ferengi in tng i didn t like the ending of the episode as i have little respect for ferengi and i m like screw these guys but it was a great overall plotline and i am always a fan of crossover episodes between series  exception  enterprise ending 
0,boundary expander 3  commander riker
0, gt  did you not see what riker told troi on her command test or what kirk did to edith keeler these are both different  for the riker situation he was saying you might have to pick between people to save  that s very different to marching a person an innocent off to their execution while they plead for their lives  as for edith keeler  the point there was that she was destined to die  and saving her might alter the timeline  there was no implication of that with tuvix   gt what about the individual rights of tuvok and neelix  don t each of them have just as many individual rights for all intents and purposes  they were already dead  they no longer had rights  because they no longer existed  what happened at the end of that episode wasn t freeing them from some prison  it was resurrecting them by murdering someone else  someone innocent who deserved protection 
0,that s a great episode  in particular for how it makes the comedy ferengi shriek of fear and pain that star trek usually plays for laughs into something really grim  very clever subversion of the show s own running joke 
0,for me it only works if they eventually explain to us why tal is different from dax  that s my personal feeling anyway  like is it because this is the first human host  has it always been that way  is it becuase they were lovers   no one seems to have an answer  to ke it s another mystery box that isn t getting a proper look which is so unsatisfying  if it s just got blatant representation that makes it even worse because it s borderline pandering
0,next week we ll discover that the original kelpian word for dilithium was  ham  or something similar lol 
0,she didn t have as many episodes as janeway  the doctor or 7  once 7 joined  voyager    but there were still plenty of b elanna episodes 
0,that s before tos  kinda 
0,that s the entire basis for a potential chief o brien at work spin off  that sounds like tng era o brien alright 
0,garak was definitely interested in bashir s assets
0,the klingons are well armed to a man   that s obviously helped maintain their utopia 
0,my prediction was that her time travel to the future somehow would kick off a chain of events leading to the burn  i mean  aside from saving all life in the universe which then allowed somebody to be the cause  
0,   yeah  i agree with you  i was providing another example of something that s so non sensical it makes sheer nonsense look sane 
0, gt  i see a lot of people using this argument  though it s clear that spock never intended it to be used in this way  killing one guy to bring back two others isn t a very federation thing to do  it is a federation thing to do  did you not see what riker told troi on her command test or what kirk did to edith keeler  gt  plus  as st established in the next film  the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many  again  did you not see what riker said to troi or kirk did to keeler  gt  individual rights must be respected and upheld what about the individual rights of tuvok and neelix  don t each of them have just as many individual rights 
0,holodecks all the way down man

0,no love for janeway or seven  huh 
0,if it s mirror kira  i d pay serious money to see that on ppv 
0,ds9 had the best overall acting   sisko of course   kira  odo and quark were great   garak  martok  dukat  weyoun were amazing   and the rest served their roles well 
0, gt  but would kirk  noi think that is wrong  i mean  look at  a private little war   look at what he did for khan at the end of  space seed   which came back to bite him hard   heck  even look at st6  in the end  kirk will do all sorts of things  if you convince him it s the right thing to do   heck  look at his questionable interventions in  the apple  or  this side of paradise   if he thought the best thing would be to save countless lives or improve their lives via access to the spore drive  i bet he does it in a second 
0,i m not saying it didn t work  but i do think overall it is more visually interesting to see two physical characters interact on screen  than it is to see one physical character imagining another character and having one sided interactions on screen 
0, gt  in wrath of khan  spock willingly sacrifices himself  tuvix is forced into oblivion by people who claim to respect life and free will above all else it s  the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few  not  the few should commit suicide for the many  lol  gt  dilemmas of the voyager crew aside  it s cold blooded murder  no question what would leaving tuvok and neelix dead be  afternoon tea  lol
0,i noticed the same thing last night  rewatching ds9 right now   there was one scene that had me thinking that it would have had to suck to work with an actor with bad breath 
0,i do wonder how they do any green screen effects with the orion s around  that s some decent chroma key matching they got going on 
0,i definitely think we re meant to take away that transportation is now so quick as to effectively be instant  there was a great shot in the ni var episode where the ni varan delegation teleported in whilst walking  if you re going to be transported mid stride without seeming to skip a beat that s got to be quick 
0,i totally agree  this is why we have short treks  it s unlikely that we ll ever go back to 26 episode seasons of star trek  i think season 3 has been the best so far for discovery  and they do have an arc for michael i think focusing too much on her hampers the show 
0,originally mostly just the us  but later being more  western  democracies  russia  klingons  and china  romulans  are both on the un security council  so it can t really be the un  at least initially   it s an imperfect and hyperbolic metaphor especially as the star trek has become more modern i can t really find a good authoritative reference for the my claim on what the ufp was a metaphor for  although there are many discussions   see below for authoritative reference on how the klingons being a metaphor for russian and romulans being a metaphor for china  it infers what the ufp was a metaphor for  take it how you will later races are more model around ideals  cardasians being authoritarian  ferengi being unchecked capitalists  etc  although i don t think every race is a metaphor  i d be hard pressed to say what the breen  tholian  or domion were metaphors for  here are references on the metaphors for klingon and romulan  amp  x200b  gt gene coon primarily modeled the klingons  metaphorically  on contemporary  russians   making the standoff between the species and the federation representative of that between the russians and the  americans   during the then ongoing cold war   amp  x200b  gt  roddenberry s original concept of the romulans  however  was that they represented 1960s  chinese communists  
0,ops officer    number two  right   data was 3rd in command of enterprise during tng if i recall correctly 
0,given  voyager  s situation  i understood making him into a model starfleet officer  quickly turning the maquis members who had no starfleet experience into starfleet members and doing it with only a little bit of conflict was more problematic to me 
0,i think he was right to require that  not just from a moral perspective but from a pragmatic one  i m sure federation citizens would welcome peace  and an alliance with another power  but would they welcome it if a war criminal was given de facto amnesty as part of that  like osyrra said the federation might be diminished but it s still a symbol of hope  and justice to many parts of the galaxy  if those worlds see osyrra living in peace and prosperity in the new normal what will they think of the federation  perhaps even worse  what if it inspires other federation citizens to stoop to  ends justify the means  atrocities because their leaders have openly signalled that it s something they are willing to accept if the ends are good enough really great episode and really great story line  exploring how the ideals of the federation are challenged and what the society does is classic trek 
0,as a big fsn of face off and trek  i have a lot of respect for westmores designs and neville is great but when discovery came out and i found out neville and thst punk goth douche guy were responsible for the new klingons i thought they  went way too far  it almost feels like a slight against michael westmore as well 
0,because the committed the primary sin the star trek fandom  attempting to appeal to people who weren t already star trek fans 
0,that episode hit me real good 
0,here s the thing they did such a good job with both daxs without doing that all the time  it was understood that at times she  ezri  had issues distinguishing her memories from dax s  and jadzia seemed to be very comfortable dipping her toes into the memory pool  they weren t just sitting alone at tables and taking to air  which seems like a cry for help to me anyways lol
0,12 years eh  damn i m getting old  but yeah you re right  sad really because there are plenty of good things about the many new star trek series going around  if too many people become too critical to where they can t see and enjoy the good things  the creators of the things we love will just give up and say fuck it  not that i am against criticism  it s healthy and the only way things can improve  but i feel people are becoming so critical they cannot enjoy anything  once upon a time i was guilty of that 
0,its just really stiff bad prosthetics
0,the acting is fine  the casting is fine  the special effects are fine  the directing is passable  probably  but the writing is terrible  and probably the editing too and no  i m not a homophobic transphobic racist  misogynist just because the writing is terrible it s just terrible all on its own 
0,no correct answer here  id say tng season 3  but honesty any except tos should do  i don t see someone in their 20s enjoying tos though  heck im 41 and i ve always struggled with tos
0,i was 7 when  voyager  premiered  but i learned enough about native americans during those years that i was cringing by season 5 whenever  voyager  featured vision quests or chakotay s medicine wheel 
0, gt meanwhile gray continues to show up without the methods jadzia and ezri used  there is literally no precedent for this so i m sure the writers are doing whether they want but it seems more like an inclusion angle rather than a story angle i actually think the  seeing your past hosts  is just a retcon of the storytelling method used to convey the idea of previous hosts and their internal interactions i firmly believe that if jadzia dax had been created in this decade  instead of the 90s  then we would be seeing her hosts on screen  but only visible to her  quite a bit   but that s because audiences today can  get it  as that kind of storytelling  where some on camera characters are visible to one character  but not the rest  is normalized nowadays  whereas it would have just been seen as  confusing  in the 90s  or at least  the network execs would have insisted that it would be too confusing for general audiences    i guess we can thank  the sixth sense  for the start of that normalization i also think this  storytelling retcon  makes for better storytelling  so i m ok with it  in the same way that i m ok with the  visual retcon  of having modern day interfaces in pre tos tech look more advanced than it did in the 60s however  i do think that the writers   and stamets   treatment of adira  culber  and stamets as a  family unit  is unjustified and unsupported by what we ve seen of them so far 
0,the simple green painted humans worked so well for so long then they went and frigged with it  they look plastic and like they re clearly wearing very stiff prosthetics  i find the prosthetic blending around the mouths very noticeable  not good  
0,find him and kill him
0,i disagree so strongly 
0,yep  and armin shimerman delivers that reminder perfectly 
0,that would have been rough  i didn t really like tuvix very much but who made gul janeway judge  jury and executioner  that s anti federation  as far as i m concerned  might as well be the bajoran occupation 
0,if you have a utopia but it s surrounded by hostile and aggressive neighbors it s not going to be a utopia for long unless you can defend it   the federation has learned this the hard way   that s why after wolf 359 they started building warships and better armed ships 
0, gt  gt we had a probe travel thousands of light years to talk to whales  star trek iv  gt  gt and a slow as heck probe being turned into a gigantic probe that returned back to earth because reasons i m not saying they are bad  but i m pointing out the flaws in his non sensical argument 
0,the enterprise being a flagship never actually makes sense  in the context of what a flagship actually is 
0,according to the voyager  equinox  two parter  in multi ship operations the captain of the ship with tactical superiority has a level of authority above the captains of the other ships this is supported in  the doomsday machine   in which commodore decker s ship was heavily damaged   if decker had been a captain  kirk could have refused his order to use the enterprise to attack the planet killer   but since decker hadn t been relieved of duty or declared medically unfit  he was able to take command of the enterprise by pulling rank so  it s no surprise that picard takes command of the fleet when there isn t an admiral or commodore to give orders  since both the galaxy class enterprise d and the sovereign class enterprise e are reliably the most powerful starfleet ships wherever they go as far as the latest enterprise remaining the flagship indefinitely   all good things     seems to indicate that isn t the case   in the 25 years later timeline  the enterprise d is only 1 3 of the way into its designed lifespan  and has already had at least one major refit   yet  admiral riker had to exert his privilege either to personally command the ship or to have it in service at his beck and call  either way suggesting that it had been retired from the flagship role 
0,as much as a have major problems with voyager  neelix was never one of them and even when the writers were trying really hard to make him annoying  i never thought he was 
0, gt  i salute you for starting on tos and not getting turned off by it  it wasn t my cup of tea and i ve never watched much of it ngl  i was tempted to skip it and go directly to the next generation as i fucking love patrick stewart and will watch anything with him in it  i decided to start with tos as it s where everything began  and i feel like i would have missed critical references made in the next generation and other star trek shows  some effects are silly looking  but nothing too bad when you ve seen  these monsters   in new who who both are silly looking  and fart for some reason  i think the only episode that was hard to get through so far in season 1  was  charlie x  as every time he did the face to make things disappear  i died laughing thank you for the recommendation on how to watch the whole universe 
0,i like the not so subtle reminder that while humanity by and large has tamed its wilder nature  that savagery is just below the surface 
0,in early episodes of tng they do state the klingons joined  but that was quickly retconned away to be simply allies 
0, eyeroll the acting isn t bad  the writing is bad 
0,tos if they like camp  tng if they re a normie   it is my firm belief that a first time viewer the first season of tng is not noticeably bad  so i wouldn t really treat that as a factor  i really do think this is only evident as a comparison thing once you ve seen the whole series  imho season one is totally great and fun the first time around  
0,actors are paid to make the awkward look natural   compared to some of the stuff they have to do  standing inside a typical personal space bubble is nothing 
0,i have nothing against abrams personally  and  objectively  he has done some amazing things  i couldn t do anything of what he has done  having said that i wasn t particularly fond of his st films  honestly mainly because of the recasting  it was never going to work for me  i guess the stories on top of that weren t so amazing that it made up for it  on top of that i d like to also take this moment to say that super 8 was not an enjoyable experience for me either 
0,is that about being up on the low rises crew or watching the docks and the warehouse where s garak  kira   where s garak 
0,star trek started out as a one hour tv show  it grew bigger and better  but one hour tv shows do not always translate into great 2 3 hour movies  i love star trek  always have  always will  no matter who is the director  it is the story that makes the  trek    live long and prosper 
0, gt we had a probe travel thousands of light years to talk to whales  star trek iv and a slow as heck probe being turned into a gigantic probe that returned back to earth because reasons 
0,i know but it s just a waste of his character to make him a model starfleet officer after the first 2 episodes   he even whips other officers in shape like when paris was gambleing and the other maquis  they could have done so much more with him as a former terrorists 
0,true indeed  no question about that

0,chakotay was a starfleet officer before he joined the maquis  so he knew what starfleet s rules were  and there were instances such as the  equinox  2 parter where his criticism made sense  
0,i had fun with them     in fact i liked them better as almost all other star trek movies  except 2 or 3 movies   the todays problem is  that everyone is a fucking critic and the internet and reddit enables them to post their  problems  about the movies everywhere

0,yes  need to account for inflation since 1966 
0,they were entraining  but didn t have that star trek soul   it was a generic sci fi movie that just happened to have the star trek name 
0,robert beltran was definitely critical of the way chakotay was written  and rightfully so   there s plenty of documentation about it on memory alpha 
0,i absolutely hate it  the application looks shoddy as well around the lips  discovery cant leave well enough alone 
0,i was seven so they were very serviceable when they aired to me lol 
0,i m a president  not a businessman
0,i keep hearing the first few seasons of tng were bad  but how recently have you watched them  season 1 had one genuinely awful episode  code of honor  and a couple meh episodes  but the rest were pretty good and several were excellent  season 2 was similar  but it brought a few greats like measure of a man and q who 
0,i don t hate the abrams trek movies simply because it s what finally got me into trek one of my earliest memories was of my mother bringing me to watch nemesis when it came out i was 4 at the time and didn t think much of trek till i watched the reboot and fell in love with trek but i see both sides of the argument some i can agree on some i think people are being very to nit picky with why they hated it after going back and watching nearly all of trek  still haven t seen every episode of ds9 and tng and i can t stand to watch tos but love the tos movies go figure  i see where they come from but at the end of the day if it wasn t for the reboot i probably wouldn t have gotten into trek in the first place and we probably wouldn t have new trek despite a few wishing we didn t have new trek
0,yea o brien specifically notes this in an episode of ds9 stating that it was suuuuper boring being the transporter chief on the enterprise as nothing ever happened and he prayed for a malfunction so that he would have something to do also the operations officer most likely is in charge of resources throughout the ship and monitoring how much of what the ship has and what the ship needs while probably liaising between engineering and the sciences for stuff like computer utilization  power distribution  and sensor positions  tactical officer probably is also running a lot of drills  not just battle simulations but also emergency procedure and internal security drills 
0,i did check that page before posting   i found it a little light on details

0,  
0,i normally suggest people start with tng  especially if they re younger  tos has a slower pace and a bit harder to get into for some new people 
0,you could assume that   but you could assume alot of things  like tuvoks mannerisms when he states how long it would take to reprogram the array  doesn t suggest he is unde pressure
0,but why did osayraa had to capture enterprise and risk getting killed when flying into the shields when she wants to negotiate  she could have just called or what am i missing 
0,helps a lot when someone else is doing the writing for you
0,it could have been more heart wrenching and incredibly powerful if he d been in a few more episodes  but probably would have resulted in viewer outrage at her actions 
0,you do know the show creator runner for discovery was the main writer for that movie  right  the script really makes things much clearer 
0,episodes like  remember  and  muse   which i think were 2 of the best b elanna episodes  didn t have a  klingon outburst  plot 
0,is that really relevant to the acting i ll take major kira and or jadzia dax over any of the discovery girls any time  but i wouldn t say the acting would be of any factor in this decision

0,  
0,space opera is more grand scale  at most ds9   its more about space battles and adventure on an epic scale  star trek is at its best when it stays with more intimate sci fi stories or morality plays  but that s just my opinion 
0, remember    faces  and  muse  are my favorite b elanna episodes  and i think  remember  is the 2nd best  voyager  episode

0,by  on the other end of the spectrum  i m going to have to assume you mean fantastic comedy storytelling  as opposed to the great drama storytelling of the previously listed episodes  because that s what they all are

0,  
0,it s great due to the episode placement it s during a super tense story arc and the baseball game is refreshing break from the intensity of the dominion war
0,okay  i like all of those  maybe not so much one little ship  but i do enjoy all the others 
0,it s excellent  and one little ship  while not excellent  is classic tng style trek 
0,wow  imagine their promises of utopia  imagine the lies and manipulations of promises of utopia as the planets had their referenda on leaving the federation  how they were promised it would be so easy and they would have their sovereignty back to build this utopia  then the slow  endless grind of negotiations re defence and trade to leave the federation  rushing something through in a panic at the end  and finding that building a better utopia compared to the real politick utopia of the federation didn t work and actually  no one wanted to join  or if they did  weren t welcome  and as the project failed they blamed the people for not wishing hard enough for their unicorn utopia with pixie dust   sorry  jaded remainer here   but also  people have enough to eat  freedom to express themselves  jobs they like and are valued for  even if they are just a gardener  it s why i don t buy into the picard android thing premise in the first place   all are valued  even those with low intellect and ability should and can contribute to society  it is anti tech in that way  all versions of trek  have shown in stories people chasing other utopias tend to be na√Øve hippies or fundamentalists of some kind  inadequate or threatening of personal freedoms  so i don t buy it happening  but if it did  then the federation would just respect its new neighbours ex members to do their own thing  unless they attacked them  it is a founding principle 
0,garak s introduction in s1e4 is simply amazing  right away he pick up doctor bashir has a potential asset he can exploit later  garak compliments the doctor s quality he s looking for in an asset  it s the same qualities that had him be replaced by the dominion and recruited in section 31 later  what a great setup 
0, gt she s also impressed saru on numerous occasions throughout the series with her command abilitydo you have any examples 
0,the operations officer monitors sensors and internal systems  even when nothing is going on  they are the one in charge of monitoring ship systems to make sure everything is working correctly  monitoring sensor readings to see if they are passing anything interesting dangerous worth investigating  everything beyond tos has no comm officer  communications are handled by either the tactical officer or operations officer  the tactical officer probably isn t doing all that much most of the time  they are probably also keeping an eye on sensors to know about any tactical threat as soon as possible  and if they are also security officer they need to draw up duty schedules and assignments and all that kind of stuff  when the ship is just cruising through space without any thing going on it s probably pretty boring for the entire bridge crew  i imagine they watch seinfeld on the viewscreen   
0,i love the original series  but it might be difficult for a newbie because it s fifty years old and the episodes are hit or miss  i would start them off with season three of the next generation  if they enjoy that  then they ll probably enjoy the rest 
0,i view id as a reinterpretation of space seed and something of an inversion of the undiscovered country in the warhawk admiral marcus  beyond   generic muh revenge plot  it s a sleek timeline though  i enjoy revisiting it regularly 
0,i liked it too 
0,that s just the writers hanging a lampshade 
0,oof i had forgotten all about that part  guess that means it s time for a rewatch      
0,i didn t like the fact that it took burnham to discover the cause of the burn and that nobody from the current timeline could work it out  it is illogical it seems that both discovery and picard have a thing with the federation being reluctant or unwilling to resolve a huge mystery  specifically the cause of a huge catastrophic event  this is something that would ve once been done in the space of a few episodes  with no shortage of technobabble and someone reversing the polarity  
0,i actually find her eerily like some engineers i ve known 
0,ops officer probably is constantly running scans and watching for anything weird comm would do the same thing but for watching for any possible incoming messages 
0,i asked the same thing while watching  i kind of liked it though  once i settled in to the unexpected choice 
0,the best character
0, since my personal taste is objectively spectacular  when i dislike something it must be because of the writing or the acting being bad  yes    and the pacing is all over the place smh   people are my favorite  there was a popular post yesterday  ranting about burnham being the protagonist of dsc  it was full of them

0,thank you 
0,same  i was actually surprised as my memory from when it was on the air was different it wasn t just that she got angry a lot  because we saw that with worf as well  but she d constantly get angry at the people around her and it became exhausting when it felt like that was all she really was  she was a good and reliable engineer  but she pretty much noped out of her klingon heritage for too long  seemed like 5 seasons like you said  i was very disappointed on my most recent rewatch 
0,riker made an oopsie and did a eugenics 
0,a lot of these stories require such leaps  julian assange is a russian spy  we invaded iraq to liberate their people the crazier the story sounds  the more concerned the storytellers are about making it sound crazy  so you don t ask too many questions  of them  or yourself 
0,she does not look happy  poor kes 
0,cadet kirk being promoted directly to captain was the honestly the biggest problem i had with those movies  it made literally zero sense and i have absolutely no idea why they did it 
0,for a show you don t like  you seem awfully obsessed with making mean comments to people who do like it 
0,you re really running into the problem with your argument when you try to conflate age with experience or quality of acting with age  cruz has barely any stage experience  his television and movie roles are minor and few and far between  with few remarkable roles to point to  rapp s the best actor of the bunch  too bad he s a side character and yeoh is was a reoccurring guest star  are you not even going to try to defend martin green s wooden acting  she is the star after all  should you try and compare her to the stars of other trek shows and not side characters like geordi 
0,could have been  the urgency of their actions implies the opposite though does it not 
0,it s okay if you don t like the show  you don t need to go be a jerk online to people about it though 
0,i find this argument to be on extremely shaky ground  in wrath of khan  spock willingly sacrifices himself  tuvix is  forced  into oblivion by people who claim to respect life and free will above all else  dilemmas of the voyager crew aside  it s cold blooded murder  no question 
0,you know what  i like lens flares  they make everything look shiny and futuristic and i like the vibe  hating them is not really a problem with the whole film just one stylistic aspect of the cinematography  i think they re fun films  very enjoyable  and a totally valid interpretation of the os characters 
0, was he 40  i m not sure how long talaxians live  also  comparing her to naomi is very different from what you are saying 
0,the implication is that riker realized he wasn t doing geordi a favor  and respected his agency and choice in the matter 
0,ds9 is by far my favorite and feels more modern and topical than tos or tng 
0,tuvix was janeways very own     kobeeashy maroo
0,you mean besides this already heart wrenching  stomach churning episode 
0,riker violated geordi s bodily autonomy by granting him functioning eyes  yes are treatment providers removing cochlear implants immediately on demand  or are there discussions   here s a link to an article about removal    medical and bioethical considerations in elective cochlear implant array removal   would seem to indicate that it really is more complicated than simply  do it   okay  
0,this is my concern with most of the criticism surrounding michael   if this was the christopher pike show i m almost certain you wouldn t have the constant complaints about focussing on a single character    actually  what am i talking about   we already have a star trek show about a single white male and nobody complains about the lack of an ensemble cast in picard 
0,i thought it was making fun of the enterprise a intro scene
0,lemme help   
0,hm guess i must ve missed that  was it yesterday 
0,its the name  any show called  the wire  turns out to be good i guess
0,and it s only the fourth garak episode 
0,i assume that the people who didn t like his songs just didn t go to  vic s  
0,because they weren t star trek   they were generic space action movie directed by a guy who s only interest is to see how much shit he can put on the screen   the story in the first one was like something a child wrote   a cadet on on probation for cheating gets command   and gets promoted five grades instantly and command of the fleet flagship   come on   that was just stupid   the second one was even more nonsensical than the first   and the last one   unreal   beating the aliens with rap music 
0,originally they didn t  they locked it and deleted the post  that s why i say  thank you to the mods for putting this back  
0,the first one in 2009  you don t get to   gt  just destroy vulcan   lt i still enjoyed the movies except for that  for the most part though 
0,wish he d had a story arc  would have packed an emotional punch 
0,implicit in the idea of a utopia is that you shouldn t have to be trained and armed to live healthy and free   if you are  you are living in perpetual fear of an enemy who could be your neighbor   that doesn t sound utopian to me 
0, deleted 
0,i think that s the better framing  let s say that doctor crusher could perform a regular eye transplant to  fix  geordi s vision   it would be unethical to perform the transplant  without his permission   and that s effectively what riker did here  i think 
0,the first one is ok as an homage  kind of like the latest godzilla  it s a fan letter of references and in jokes  nothing groundbreaking but nothing bad either  into darkness was the opposite  it was kind of sacrilegious without any respect for the source material  not good beyond was meh 
0,needs more ensemble acting and less pairing up all the time   something like a poker game or a real bar with bartender 
0,and also why split it at that point  whose death was the last straw for her 
0,it s been a while since i saw that episode  so i only vaguely recall the specifics  but didn t riker do it expressly because he said he knew it was something that geordie wanted and wished for  like  sure  someone who s been disabled in some way since they were a child may have accepted and come to terms with it as an adult  still doesn t mean they didn t wish the condition was reversed  and he definitely seemed happy when he got to actually  see  tasha yar for the first time 
0,tos is is the place to start  if you like it you ll get hooked  i m currently in ds9  doing a chronological sweep  
0,this is something that happens in real life  people born without hearing have received cochlear implants and then later had them     this is due to the fact that cochlear implants can be perceived to  cure  deafness or fix an individual s hearing    34     when in reality those who are deaf may not feel a need to be cured or fixed  forcing a  cure  onto geordie when he did not want or need one  is itself immoral 
0,it was never her fault though  she was affected by the actions of others  braxton mainly 
0,  or the one 
0,they did during the  movie  episode  they also made fun of the drydock scene from tmp  amongst others 
0,yea  you see this giant station  but still the promenade is so small 
0,i don t know   not that i remember 
0,picard s the worst for sure  i d say lower decks is the best followed by dis and then picard way  way below either  i d have disco above ld if it didn t start out so unevenly 
0,and then had the  gall  to say that kirk and company would have been thrown out of star fleet for their actions  still pisses me off 
0,she killed tuvix 
0,recently  i rewatched faces  that episode was just such a weird way to handle her inner turmoil on a sidenote  i was really bothered that they just left all the other aliens to be worked harvested by the viridians 
0,i think both are important   just look at america   it s the most heavily armed population on the planet   but most people don t value freedom   they say they do but they don t   and until that changes we won t have freedom 
0,sure  but what i m getting at is that andrew robinson  or patrick stewart are already sitting on a decent enough foundation that even if garak or picard weren t played by their respective actors  they d probably still be decent enough characters  and  if they  weren t  they d probably be written out of the show  garak  for all he s loved by the fandom  has a fairly slow start   he appears only in a single episode of season 1  and only 4 in season 2 
0,i disagree with you  but i don t think tig notaro does 
0,the circumstances of her collaboration were understandable  but it was still considered collaboration  though i imagine the decision was even tougher for her since her son was 1 of the 42  
0,though i could ve done without avery brooks  duet on  best is yet to come   honestly   
0,archer is still part of the equation  his expedition paved the way for what captains should and shouldn t do in starfleet  he even makes loose reference to the prime directive in  dear doctor   when he decides  not  to interfere in the evolution of a species 
0, gt but why wouldn t geordi be fine with being able to see normally what you deem normal is something geordi never experienced in his entire life up until this point  he used a visor since he was 5  while geordi is certainly aware that his condition isn t the norm  him seeing through the visor was his normalcy for decades    he was also fine with the way he lived and he was already a capable starfleet officer  he therefor logically objected to something which was forced upon him 
0,tng
0,we were so lucky then  i miss he days of 23 episode seasons  discovery s season 3 finale will be episode number 13  i thought we d have a few more than that    
0,janeway is my favorite because the other captains are so boring and one dimensional  like i love picard but i know at the end of each episode he is going to be making an unrealistically great decision that benefitted everyone   with janeway she made bad calls and there were consequences  like in reality 
0,bear in mind old star trek got the benefit of seasons almost twice as long  in the sense of having enough practice to work out the kinks  and more time each season to actually get at least something right  s4 tng is like s8 disco 
0,i m watching this very episode right now lol  i thought it was awesome they brought that small piece of lore from tng
0,if you say so   an armed population is probably the only reason america hasn t turned into nazi germany   and it gives any would be invader a reason not to invade 
0,this is broken bow the first one  just keep with it  it doesn t stick to that 
0,rom is awesome  he cares about people tries to help others like the dabo girls   this show has so much great character growth for many of it s characters overall 
0,ngl  i don t like kirk either tbh 
0,i m pretty sure the actor who plays j  tal  hope i m remembering his name right  also played dr  mora  which is probably why he reminds you of him
0,i also think that roxann dawson was one of the better actors on voy  next to kate mulgrew and robert picardo the writers didn t give her a lot of great character building moments  but when she had them roxann nailed them in the later seasons  the b elanna character was always caught between two worlds   it takes acting skill to nuance your way through a range of emotions like that she also embraced the techno babble and made it believable  something other actors clearly struggled with 
0,without getting technical  i see it as a mixed message like the jedi from star wars  the action heroes are also pacifists  it s a contradiction that boils down to the creators having their cake and eating it too 
0, gt  a galaxy wide disaster being perpetrated by a kid being emotional is so much worse than even spock s brain that it s not even funny you are criticizing this  have you forgotten   charlie x  a lot of q episodes  nagilum  the survivors episode and that kevin fella  trelaneand also on the point of other weird episodes   threshold  we still don t know if paris and janeway had little babies either  that time barclay got a really weird flu  the whole galactic barrier incident  a lot of shit with the transporters  like kiddo picard  the whole mirror universe fuckerygenuinely though  star trek has a long history of omnipotent beings just fucking up the universe  often without understanding the repercussions of their actions  or viewing all us simply sentient beings like we view ants 
0,i always suggest tos 
0,or beaming photon torpedoes into the kazon ships to destroy them  something they only did once with the borg 
0,idk if the mods wanted to enforce a pro discovery groupthink why leave this thread up  considering it s filled with ppl agreeing with op and offering their own criticisms of discovery and the occasional hate comment 
0,i agree  but i don t think that boils down to the actress being bad  in fact  while i m quite tired of the melodrama i will say that one of the highlights of season two was seeing burnham and spock share scenes  yes the drama was annoying but those two had chemistry and it showed 
0,when this happens i assume that the writers are writing for the execs advertisers more then the viewers and fans and most of the time are they are morons 
0,i was mid s2 of my first full ds9 watch through when the pandemic hit  watching the rest of that series in the first few months was definitely anxiety inducing at times  it s especially rough when you see large crowds on the promenade  or a large complement exiting a ship through the docks into the station  ds9 is just a lot busier  and more claustrophobic than the enterprise 
0,my understanding of the hatred for ds9 was that if you missed a week you may have missed a big part of the series  this wasn t true with any of the others really  ds9 lends itself really well to this era we re in where you can just binge watch it 
0,wasn t there a voyager one with chakotay 
0,my condolences to your liver 
0,warp cores are pretty great though   
0,nah no  sisko and janeway are the worst  number one is definitely pike because he really is the heart of the best version of star fleet in every act and word  second place is archer  he was alone with his crew  no possible back up  nothing  a pioneer  he had it harder than anyone else then picard who did have some flaws  then captain saru then kirk with his cowboy mentality then janeway  and then sisko with the moral code of a stone 
0,audiences enjoy singing  and writers enjoy taking a break 
0,with discovery it s a bit shoddy because the writing is good at best but if you watched the latest episode  it has a very good set of scenes between an admiral and the current big bad that touches upon a lot of important things as for picard  well the whole premise of kickoff for the show was how easy we re willing to sacrifice our values  that s the whole  the federation right now sucks  thing  but the show has a bit of an issue to bring up an interesting premise then not going anywhere with it  which has been an issue i am having with it if neither of these things are touching you somehow then    well it can just not be your thing  that s fine  you don t have to like everything in a franchise  i don t think lower decks is a good addition to trek at all  yet a lot of people seem to enjoy it  i recently watched enterprise and found the experince watching it kinda jarring because it was noticeable when it was written and that a lot of writers were americans 
0,some people aren t really angry at a thing  they are just angry  maybe at themselves  maybe at life  but they have allowed their emotional state to override their rationality and impartiality  the jj treks are good  but they are action fluff meant to reboot a beloved franchise nothing more and that sets some people off  some people need to basically just check  themselves before they wreck themselves  many topics could be debated to death  but at its core it seems it is rationality debating the result of emotions being left unbridled  just my take on it and all of the recent  controversies  see  toxic behaviour  the sci fi community has been facing  it s meant to be entertainment  stop taking it so seriously or find a way to get involved with it if that s what you want  geez 
0,exactly this  every franchise will be criticized  it s the legitimacy of the criticism that matters  there s zero question that the fan response to the new trek series has been more negative than any past series  and there are very good reasons for the reaction 
0,that was tng   and they chose to be under cardassian jurisdiction   considering how the cardassins treat their prisoners and how corrupt their legal system is it was not a smart decision 
0,that s because michael burnham being the solution to the majority of things is only a short hand people are using for a more general criticism of the show there s a repeat character this season without a name  unless you watch using subtitles  even on discussion boards people can t tell you the names of the bridge crew or sometimes their specific roles on the ship  who is the chief medical officer do you know without looking it up  do you know their name in past series there was a focus on specific characters  but they aren t reliably the only person offering solutions  burnham went on multiple 2 person away missions this season  each time resolving the issue while another person was utterly useless even if the focus was intended to be on them 
0,haven t watched the video u linked yet  but i will say that up until seska betrays the crew  the first 10ish episodes or so of voyager are actually kind of good  or at least surprisingly more tolerable than i remembered  currently on season 2 episode 6 so i ll see how it turns out 
0,if garak had done a singing number i dont think there would be complaints  yeah  it was most likely time filler  but vic was being used to make the crew members happy 
0,i m pretty sure lower decks had a few scenes with extra lens flare tossed in for comedic effect 
0,how old is your friend 
0,because abrams is a terrible writer and hsa terrible scripts   it was just a generic action scifi movie that happened to have a star trek theme   abrams singlhandidly ruined star wars too 
0,so if i enjoyed  old trek  at the time  tng  ds9  voy  and ent  are my criticisms and reservations about discovery and picard somehow more relevant  does that prove that i don t find them problematic simply because they re new 
0,interesting  i liked the first and third ones the most  into darkness was fun but had the most nonsensical plotholes of the three  my biggest gripe about beyond was that before it came out the writers were claiming that the antagonist wasn t going to be generic bad guy and would just have a different viewpoint vs the federation  but then when it was released he was just a generic bad guy without some alternate ideology 
0,i don t understand this apologist mentality  while it s true that new iterations of beloved franchises will always get some amount of a reactionary response  and especially in the internet age  it ignores the facts of the matter  those shows became beloved and showed more than a bit of critical merit by the end of their third seasons  not really for voy or ent imo  but then neither of those tend to be fan favorites compared to tos tng ds9  they at the very least felt cohesive with 90s trek verse   dis seems much more hugely divisive in comparison and can be broken down from an objective viewpoint  it has measurable storytelling and character writing flaws  if these things were more solid  the lazy adherence to canon and the whole michael burnham premise would be forgivable by most i think it s not that big a problem to me  i just consider abrams kurtzman to be non canon  the massive tonal discrepancies of dis and pic make it really easy  the whole kelvin   prime timeline thing is ultimately a corporate construct that i can choose to ignore as easily as nu trek ignores its own legacy 
0,this pretty much sums up the points that were made by different people in a single comment  if i could  i d mark it as the correct answer for that 
0, gt  aside from detmernone of them have had appreciable character development either  we had a few episodes of detmer dealing with ptsd and that was very quickly solved  we know that owo grew up in a  primitive  compound or something on earth  but that s it  we know literally nothing about rhys or bryce 
0,  
0,basically what happened on nervala was almost exactly what happened to the crew of the no bloody enterprise in mirror mirror  transporting through an ion storm   my theory basically goes that when they tried to second containment beam it lensed through the storm and locked onto a version of riker from a multi verse that had been functionally identical in all ways relevant to the federation prior to that moment  the initial transport failed  prime riker got left on nervala  alt riker beamed up to the potemkin with no idea anything was out of place  but then he wasn t quite the same person  so his relationship with deanna collapsed  he  suddenly  felt guilty about his actions on the pegasus  etc  that s why when they found tom he almost managed to get with troi  he was the man she d fallen in love with  and the only differences were their respective life experiences since his stranding  not fundamental minor differences in personality that will had 
0,so if i enjoyed  old trek  at the time  tng  ds9  voy  and ent  are my criticisms and reservations about discovery and picard somehow more relevant  does that prove that i don t find them problematic simply because they re new 
0,she seemed like a  grown woman  in the way a 20 year old is technically a grown woman  still creepy if a 40 year old is trying to lock that down  and that is definitely the creepy vibe her relationship with neelix has 
0,well  i m feeling intensity but not in a good way haha  but eventually you get used to it  must be the same for the actors
0,this happened on voyager  that planet of native  americans that refused to relocate again  they chose to be outside of star fleet as the remedy 
0,beating the aliens with rap music 
0,this is my personal experience from someone who watched tos starting at  8 years old on vhs  i love the kelvin trek films because i think they captured much of the tos spirit of an action adventure science fiction show that allowed for social commentary i think the biggest reason why they get hated upon is because they moved outside of preconceived notions of trek from prior eras  either tos or tng  and not be willing to move outside of that box  star trek had to be dramatic  and slower paced  and the characters had to behave a certain way  amp  x200b in abrams  trek you find a star trek that was designed with a faster pace  and very 2000s sensibilities  and it felt very different from the 60s  80s or 90s of prior treks  and that is why i think there was such push back  amp  x200b it was also one of the first times that classic characters like kirk and spock had been rebooted in this franchise  so  it was a bit like going from adam west batman to burton batman  though  i would say  not quite that extreme  but  if one comes looking for tos you re not going to find it  amp  x200b into darkness was the one place of a misstep with khan  khan  to my mind  was completely unnecessary  and i m not talking about casting  in a world of consciousness transfers cosmetic surgery to hide an identity is rather pedestrian  having khan invariably invites comparisons to what is considered star trek s best work  so  no matter what abrams  and company did it would invite that comparing  and into darkness would come out poorly   amp  x200b to that end  i think into darkness is an ok film with a some excellent stand out parts  espeically with kirk and his overall arc of learning to be a leader  i think spock has great follow up from his own trauma of losing his planet and mom  there are excellent character moments throughout that film that still make it enjoyable for me  amp  x200b beyond is a good film  largely because it continues on with kirk and spock  the villain is sadly less than memorable  unfortunate  but kirk and company are still great  jaylah is a great addition  amp  x200b all told  i think abrams  trek suffers from doing its own thing with characters that had  up until that film  only one interpretation  so the pushback is less the films themselves and more them touching something many regard as sacred 
0,i loved that interaction  she hated everything to do with time travel and said so frequently  and the time cops hated her as well every time they saw her again i think it was an intentional running gag and i love the notion of the relentless having a  public enemy  board with janeway at the top 
0,well  i m the 8th comment  so i m going to say        8      
0,yep  been watching enterprise and voyager recently too  and people really love to get up in each others faces sometimes i suspect your theory is probably right  and they might feel it adds some intensity or something too 
0,i can understand if some say that discovery stories ignore traditional star trek lore  like people still using dilithium 900  years in the future instead of quantum slip stream  iconian gates  sikarian gates  micro singularities or any other advanced means of propulsion   but you can t fault the actors  they do a good job   or the visuals  the show looks great   much less  diversity   11 25  of humanity is caucasian  the other percentage includes everyone else   or a homosexual couple  homosexuals have existed forever and are part of society regardless of some not  liking  them  they don t need your approval to exist   
0,please don t apologise to this guy 
0,i have a couple of the roddenberry badges made from the original molds materials  the qmx badges are  mostly  the right size and shape but i ve never liked that they re metal  anyway here are some photos next to a ruler  
0,except there were other galaxy class ships commissioned at the time and the tng technical manual says the enterprise was the third galaxy class vessel built  why would the enterprise be the flagship and not one of the others 
0,you can see them here and searching for  star trek  
0,you mean who were also british subjects 
0, gt  i don t enjoy the writing   they say   the writing is terrible   the writing isn t terrible  people don t like the writing this is my issue  the vitriol  the majority of hate the show receives is wildly over the top  there are valid criticisms to be had  season 2 s overarching plot was mess because of shuffling showrunners  but i accept it s flaws and enjoy the great characterizations we get from pike  spock  stamets  culber  jett  and the rest of the main crew but the show is frequently berated in a fashion that tells me not only am i wrong for liking the show  warts and all  but that i m  hurting star trek  by liking it  that just gets frustrating 
0,because it s awesome  da fuck 
0,the thing about kirk is that while some things are campy   expound on the importance of the constitution in a torn t shirt    that is different than outright bad  things in the old trek tos  tng  ds9  voy  ent  and their movies  is that they can be campy and fun  even the kelvin timeline movies can be campy and stupid  std takes itself way too seriously  so much so i only watch the first episode and haven t watched one since 
0,i mean  i m straight  but if pike asked me to dance it would be hard to say no 
0,how is voy any different   one episode almost destroyed  low on supplies  heavily damaged and the next ep like nothing happened   they sure bet on the fans being morons for accepting it  voy had so much potential to be the best trek ever 
0,ahsoka tano is a well written character  what are you talking about  
0,right   where is naomi s mom   there are so many moments where we only see naomi and neelix or seven and never her mom  even when they are in naomi s quarters  so strange  who is supervising that child  
0,because they aren t very good at least the first two  i never saw the third one  2009  the best part of course is that leonard nimoy  other then that this film is okay  but the flashes of light are annoying  and the whole  kirk  skips the ranks form ensign to captain is stupid and makes no sense  into darkness  steals from the original movies and didn t need to recreate the famous scene just swamping characters  i do not feel these movies needed to be made 
0,seems like she probably just split the timeline  the same way the kelvin universe split off due to time travel shenanigans 
0,also  it turns out  if you watch it you don t get a say in how it should go 
0,i think the same is true of most characters  would garak be the same character if he wasn t played by andrew robinson  would picard be if he wasn t played by patrick stewart 
0,lol
0,didn t admiril janeway break a whole lot of rules and regulations in the finale  court marshall her  also she s on 29th century starfleet watch list 
0,because they are schlock and bad     
0,burnham having at least two of those drama scenes every episode doesn t help 
0,yeah  that was a drinking game i lost very quickly
0,we need more of the kelvin timeline asap 
0,psh  war crimes    he can live with those  
0,any utopia that has to work that hard on planetary defenses and has to arm citizenry to prevent tyranny is not a utopia 
0,that s a fair explanation  thank you 
0,the problem with all of your responses here is it basically falls under the idea that  the system should assume that things are always going to go right you assume that everyone always makes the right choice unless the pd prevents them   you assume that leaders are always benevolent  that citizens are always reasonable and peaceful and tolerant  that plans of action always go exactly as you intended them laws dont exist for the times everything is going fine  they exist for the times everything goes tits up   the road to hell is paved with good intentions  and that s what you re building your statehouse out of
0,when i want a strong female character who can kick ass  i ll watch ds9 thanks 
0,tig notaro  reno  acting is awful af the other actors and actresses are fine to me 
0,this  more than anything  it just wouldn t make for a very interesting episode if the antagonist of the week showed up  only for picard or whomever to be able to go   we clearly have the upper hand  nothing to see here  
0,she collaborated  but she did what she thought was best and saved 1200 people over 42 
0,oh hell no   making anything mandatory would be tyrannical   but owning weapons and arming ships should be encouraged   the federation had the technology to destroy it s enemies if they started a war   but they only lightly armed their ships   this led to a lot of unnecessary casualties in the cardassian border wars and dominion war   not to mention at wolf 359   also their tactics were horrible   what if the klingons  romulans  and cardassians joined forces and tried to conquer the federation   it would probably be wise for them to plan to be able to defeat all their enemies at once if they united against them   like in the mirror universe   mirror spock disarmed the terran empire and that led to it being conquered   so having heavily armed warships is probably a good idea you could also invest in planetary defenses   orbital defense platforms  surface to space cannons  planetary shields if you can generate the energy to power them  and mines but only deploy them if absolutely necessary   this could deter an invasion but not make it look like your planning to invade your neighbors   so there is something to be said for being ready to fight the whole quadrant   if the whole quadrant thinks that a war would cost them too much or that they would lose they would be far more inclined to want peace 
0,and dax  kira  janeway  etc
0,i like your use of stiv to explain what makes trek good  that s perfect  sadly  i don t think discovery is meant to be camp  i think it s supposed to be serious  socially aware drama that fails at that and at best comes across as camp 
0,positively 
0,michael explained it s an emergency escape pif energy bubble with a homing signal so fhq would see it 
0,tim burton and helena bonham carter exploring the origin of the borg 
0, gt  it takes a lot more energy to hate than accept does it  i find it takes more energy to subvert my natural response  if i dislike something it takes more energy to accept it  e g  cauliflower   if i like something it takes more energy to reject it  e g  burgers  
0,oh yeah  now that i think about there s a couple of war crimes in ds9
0,i don t know  but if i want to make myself cry i can listen to  it s only a paper moon  and that will do it
0, gt  tng had detractors because of some people who didn t like change  disco has detractors who are st fans and tried very hard to like it and are just exhausted by the terrible writing do you think the tng detractors would have described themselves as such  or do you think they would say they were exhausted by  terrible writing  do you think there s any chance discovery detractors might be more affected by an aversion to change than they re willing to admit 
0,its mainly because the first one was so good  that i remember people wondering what could be next for the now big budget trek films  but because of bad choices  into darkness  or into dumbness  sucked and beyond could ve been better 
0,pretty soon they ll have their lantern jawed hero to admire   until they write him as gay    which would be appropriate and necessary 
0,yeah  well  i m gonna go build my own federation   with black jack and hookers  in fact    forget the federation 
0,i dunno  i got the  adira and their two gay dads  vibe pretty hard the last few times we ve seen them all interact 
0,i ve got quite a few friends like that  we re different politically or when it comes to religion  but we re able to set that aside  however this last year i ve found my self cutting not one  but two people out of my life because they politized mask wearing and the pandemic  at some point someone s views can become dangerous  disagreeing over startrek or sport teams isn t that point 
0,yep  it s the writing  there were plenty of great female characters in old trek  dax  kira  seven  janeway  etc   it has nothing to do with female leads  i watched seasons 1 and 2 of discovery and was really hoping it would hit it s stride  but the season finale was a mess  it s a straight up quality issue  other people in this thread have detailed it s issues more concisely than i can  burnham s lack of character development  science basically becoming magic  ridiculously high save the universe stakes all the time   bad show is bad  it s fine if some people like it  but you can t say that people just don t like things that are new and different  when there is a long list of substantiated criticisms   the power of math  people    cringe 
0,wait  i want to hear more about this alternate timeline will riker   
0,they got it right 
0,i ve always found the appearances of those klingons quite distinct from the others   shallower  thinner ridges and generally smaller prosthetics  colonel worf is a telling example  you can see much more of michael dorn than in his usual makeup  the exceptions are the klingon ambassador  who maintains his kruge esque appearance from st4  and gorkon  who s still different but not jarringly so we seem to be having two different conversations  i m not arguing about the value of these changes  just responding to the claim that  they only changed them once  
0,looks at the expanse  pretty good from the off and just got better  the seasons leangth  number of episodes comparisons is mute 
0,spock s brain was actually a really good episode  in terms of the story between men and women on the planet and the really good acting of the main female lead in that episode   it s just the last 10 minutes of surgery on spock where he s directing bones mid surgery that s rather silly 
0,i never thought they had a bad rep  personally i just think it s the loud nitpickers that have an issue with it  no movie is perfect but i think those movies were perfectly acceptable movies to bring star trek to new audiences 
0, gt  i feel like it s always just on the cusp of getting good but it keeps stumbling personally  i think at this point it s pretty clear that any time it s approaching  goodness   it s purely accidental rather than by design  for example  i don t think saru would be nearly as beloved if it wasn t doug jones playing him  because as near as i can tell  doug jones really brings the characters he plays to life 
0,and  if you re going to call people sexists without any basess go ahead and do it  don t just be snarky about it  dr  who s writing has been heavily criticised since matt smiths final season star wars is heavily criticised for ruining characters and throwing established lore out the window discovery and picard are criticised for having bad dialogue  character development  and mystery box story telling  it must be nice to live in a world where you can just call people you disagree with some  ism  and never have to contend with what they say or why they re saying it 
0,is that the new episodic one 
0,nog too
0, gt  both also deliver messages that are relevant to these times what are they  this is my biggest struggle i think  i can t even see what they re trying to say  i feel i could forgive a lot more if i had some clue what the point was   though i admit  i haven t put a lot of thought into it because i haven t been enjoying the shows much  
0,what specifically didn t you like about vic   this is maybe one of the last takes i  ever  expected to hear  and i m dying to understand 
0,there is no longer any concept of  agreeing to disagree   my best friend and i have been friends for nearly 30 years despite being on opposite ends of the political spectrum  we just agree to more or less ignore that topic of conversation and stick to science fiction and medieval history 
0,nope
0,if i may   without getting my head bitten off  i suspect she s popular mainly amongst the males in the fandom  i can t stand the character and i m not terribly fond of the actress either  but it isn t really that important any more  i ve given up on ever loving trek the way i used to    most of the female characters i cared about have shortened stories that never truly did their characters any justice and their stories were truncated and not  told to their full potential  we never got to really go to betazed or hear about their war and troi s participation it it from the books  the hera crew and her female captain geordi s mother  sylvia  were handled as a footnote  admiral janeway should have had a movie and ensign wildman was the only female star trek officer that i can think of off the top of my head who actually married an alien  an alien who was incredibly loyal and most men can t say the same  a few episodes about her and their relationship would have been truly refreshing  but instead we got more klingons  more romulans    and more transporter malfunctions 
0,beyond was my favorite  to me me it  felt  the most like old trek    but it was written by a real fan  so not surprising 
0, gt  the abrams kurtzman era accounts for 74 of those  or 9 25  this doesn t make any sense  discovery  picard and lower decks are not abramsshitverse related  only abrams shitty as fuck kelvin verse movies are abrams related  the mentioned tv shows have nothing to do with abrams shitverse  so there is no  abrams kurtzman era  even if you define it by  stuff made after enterprise and nemesis   just a correction  i love your canon references threads  but i wanted to point this out 
0,i just feel like discovery is generic and forgettable  i ve watched them all and can t tell you much about the characters or plot lines 
0,there were episodes of ds9 where sisko appeared for about 30 seconds so he could technically be in every episode i m still waiting for that in discovery 
0,those movies look like generic big budget sci if films instead of star trek 
0,starships are actually really fragile  if you take out the shields of a starship  something  much  smaller than it can easily rip it to absolute shreds    photon torpedos will tear through even the strongest armor like a hot knife through butter      but the starfleet policy is that they re  not  a military  in tos tng days this was especially true  every single war fleet was just a group of the nearest science ships  which all happened to be fully armed      starfleet knew that a fleet of armed science ships that are ready to fight would sell the  we re a peaceful organization  better than a bunch of science ships with armed escorts  even though absolutely everyone sees through starfleet s  not a military  charade      my personal theory is that after the devastation of the dominion war and the threat of further borg incursions starfleet decided that they needed to militarize fast or face extinction  thus the fast response fleet at the end of picard  it makes sense to have a ready to go fleet of standardized warships  which makes manufacture  maintenance  and repair significantly more economical the average federation citizen may not have to deal with any form of economics but starfleet does   practical  and efficient if you can have a single line producing parts and ships one after the other  it makes popping out a new ship significantly faster and so they can ramp their fleets up when needed in a much shorter time     tl dr it s a political game to make starfleet look peaceful  as violent encounters in peacetime like what we saw with the enterprise was actually rather rare 
0,i like the new show  but it isn t a show i can watch with my six year old  like other star treks  that is my only complaint 
0,he spelled it that way on purpose  it s a meme that attacks nerds and men   the poster is a sexist and exposed themselves as such  
0,fuck it  i hate 32nd century replicators now
0,imagine if wesley cried every episode like burnham does  and broke rules without consequences  at least when wesley and lucarno fucked up at the academy starfleet imposed consequences  if that had been burnham she d have given a heart speech and all would ve been forgiven and then she d get a mcguffin to further the plot 
0,product of its time  i like the songs 
0, gt  lens flares when i tried to watch discovery i started counting lens flares at one point and there were 37 in 10 minutes 
0,series like tng  ds9  voy and ent was met with the same issue all sequels have   people are initially hesitant of different actors and tone   but all those shows were eventually welcomed by the fanbase because they proved that they retained the tone of the previous series   both the visual tone  how the show was visibly shot  and the emotional tone  the content of the writing  character development  egalitarian message and so on    all five of the first star trek shows had these principles that tied them all together the one exception to this was tng  which changed the visual tone of how things were shot   a lot less action and overacting of tos with a style trying to mimic a dramatic movie  with flat cinematography and  mostly  grounded acting   and saying flat cinematography is not a negative  which i ll go into in a minute   but basically  after the big  shock  of the transition between what was original star trek  tos   season 1 of tng  and the new more subdued and dramatic style  season 2 of tng   the show pretty much stuck to that style all the way into enterprise   with the only exception being a few movies  mostly first contact and nemesis  fast forward to star trek 2009 and jj abrams completely changed everything   both the visual tone and the emotional tone were about as opposite of star trek as you can get  with excessive cgi  fast paced editing  all the main characters can only interact with sarcasm or rage at each other  in contrast to old trek where the crew were friendly and professional to each other  and so on   this is not at all like old star trek   and jj abrams himself said he wanted it this way   he outright said in interviews he hated star trek and wanted to reboot it into what he likes   which is basically star wars with a few star trek name drops   it s not a coincidence that his star trek movies and his star wars movies have a similar tone  as well as macguffin and galaxy ending plots    but he at least said they were an alternate dimension  so we could just think of them as that   when discovery came out  kurtzman  jj abrams understudy  literally repeated the same tone of the jj abrams movies  yet insisted they were the  prime  universe   at a time when most fans were asking for a new post voy series that returned to the tone of original star trek   and many fans complained about this   the people who talked about this were smeared as  sexist  or  racist  when they weren t talking about race or sex at all   pointing out that the writing gives michael plot armor isn t sexist   pointing out that the whole romulan plot in picard is really weak is not racism  it has to do with how the romulan plot is totally overtaken by the borg plot and made pointless you can claim this is star trek  evolving  but i would say the exact opposite   because star trek hasn t evolved   it s just turned into the same generic angry action shows you see all over prime time tv   it s basically agents of shield or scandal in space   when ironically  if they had made a new show that had the tone of tng ent trek  it would stand out   people are tired of new star trek because it s just generic  poorly written melodrama 
0,star trek  2009  was fine  imo  there are some issues with it  one being jj abrams has zero concept of distances in space  or how to show the time it takes to get there in any way   also  yeah  a 3 day ensign gets captainhood just like that  wrath of khan pt 2  i mean  that sums it up right there  it was unoriginal   paid homage to  replicated so many moments from the tos  and movies  with  zero  emotional backing to them or any reason for events to happen like they did  they took wok  said  lets do this but completely different    and made it the same thing  but flashy beyond was    better  it still suffered from  hey they did this in movie 3  let s do it too   i understand the need to   sideline   destroy the enterprise    but there was no emotional  ooomph  to it  they just did it  the big problem i have with the nutrek movies is   they don t deserve any of the big moments they shove into them  trying to replicate the original show movies  looking into it  for example  kirk was in starfleet for  15 years  before getting command of the enterprise  abrams had him there in mere days of graduating the academy  tl dr version  abrams and co aimed to replicate as much as they could of the originals without caring to understand  why  those things worked in the first place 
0,for me  it s basically  already in my collection  vs  never going in my collection std  amp  stp come to mind for the latter 
0,what i find most fascinating is that every post in this sub lately is yet another post on the topic of either complaining about discovery or else sticking up for discovery  so much so that the mods have started locking threads rather quickly  but every time they lock one three more spring up  and all that s has ended up happening is that the star trek fan base is learning how to do everything that is opposite of the utopian world roddenberry wanted    we re all insulting each other and arguing with each other and silencing each other and     well  if this isn t evidence that discovery is destroying the star trek universe  i don t know what is 
0,it s a small issue  plot hole wasn t a good word to use 
0,the first two seasons of tng consistently had more bad writing than any dis season  or the first season of picard 
0,everything leveled at disco is stuff i leveled at ds9 when it came out  and i hated ds9 for it now i love it because i got over my own bullshit and i like disco too  it s bad writing why is ds9 in the middle of everything in the galaxy  why would you constantly have to have sisko  who isn t even a captain of a ship  lead the armada  why would starfleet intelligence need to tag an engineer from deep space nine  so kira is just magically part of the command structure whenever it suits them  and on and on  this is just how television works though  people don t think about it for ds9 any more because it has been decades  but the same complaints were coming out another one that i hated was this feeling that ds9 was making trek more like star wars  they changed the phasers to be pew pew pew  there were a bunch of wars  some of them at the time  like the klingon war  seemed like it was just for the sake of there being more pew pew fights  and  again  the klingons beam onto the station and sisko is  like  taking out twenty klingon warriors by himself with no weapons  why is deep space nine their only target  because it has to be the center of the galaxy and i hated  and really still hate  section 31 and the multiple starfleet coups and making it a military organization instead of exploration and on and on again  i love ds9 now  but everything people say about disco s bad writing and wrenching a character into a plot for no reason is shit i objected to twenty years ago and  if i m being honest  my beloved tng to which i measure everything else isn t really as good or consistent as it is in my head either 
0,i never much cared for him in tos  but movie kirk was much better   there was a noticeable through line in his character getting humbled and challenged   in tmp he realizes he may have lost his edge   wok is all about how he feels old and past his prime and then of course  gt  spock dies  lt    in tsfs he  gt  loses his ship and his son  lt  and in vh  gt  gets busted back down to captain  lt    then finally tuc he goes on his final mission and it has this very  ulysses   energy to it    tho we are not now that strength which in old days     and he ends triumphant  having saved the day one last time and overcome his own prejudices and insecurities it was a cool arc 
0,i disagree about voyager   see this video   here  it s a bit long  but basically the first 3 seasons of voyager are not nearly as bad as everyone says they were  the change in writing leadership lead to the more syndicated approach which didn t suit voyager s premise well at all 
0,they perverted the characters  especially kirk 
0,i have always said that it is interesting to hear the actors talk about the writing on the show   beltran and wang were frequent critics of the writing  and  i think for beltran  he had a point   chakotay had a   ton   of potential as a character  but he never had any decent screen time  and when he did get an episode  he was so poorly written that it must have driven beltran nuts 
0,wow  they did all that work and i couldn t even tell they did anything at all  and i do not mean that in a good way  i knew something was up with the facial expressions   stiff mouth but had no idea they were wearing a full covering etc
0,maybe spock s brain isn t the ideal comparison  then  maybe it s voyage home  in the beginning we have this incredibly powerful probe that is capable of ionizing the atmosphere and evaporating the oceans of entire worlds comes to potentially kill billions of people on earth  and effortlessly disables not only maybe nine starfleet vessels but spacedock itself  earth itself had to send out a distress call  huge mystery  billions of lives at stake  and what s the answer  whales  camp and serious came together in an incredible way to result in one of the best star trek movies  the joining of incredibly serious and not even remotely serious  along with sentimental and funny and boring and swashbuckling  worked  i m not saying that it ll always work  nor am i saying i even like discovery  i actually quite don t   but i also want to be careful characterizing trek as only being best in a narrow box  sometimes trek works really well when it s super serious  though sometimes not  sometimes trek works when it s balls to the wall zany  though sometimes not  trek can even thread the needle and manage to pull off both  though sometimes not  diversity in trek isn t limited to just genders or races or species  it s also genres  i think disco is meant to be melodramatic camp  and i worry that dismissing it because of this hamstrings trek going forward and misses that it s worked in the past 
1,he could be  but i m saying luke being a hermit on ahch to logically follows what han says in tfa  tlj is not inconsistent with tfa s set up for luke  that one quote  along with tfa ending with rey finding luke alone on the island  along with the   map to luke  does tie tlj and tfa together  i don t see another reason for luke hiding away on the island that makes as much sense as what we got 
1,honestly the treverow film did not seem any better for the most part where it did have a better idea is knowing what to do with finn 
1,thanks to filoni and favs we will be getting a lot about those 20 years  but your points still stand  the movies themselves did the universe no favors
1, gt 	i just hate that they mishandled this trilogy so badly that they have to fill in the blanks through supplemental material boy do i have an animated movie to sell you then    and an animated series that reboots that animated movie   and a spin off series   rinse and repeat  
1, gt rey was meant to harness both the dark side and the light side  she was meant to learn from luke s mistake in trying to surpass the darkness and anakin and ben s mistake in embracing it too much  she was meant to be the first jedi to truly embrace being human  the film would end with her teaching this to broom boy this makes literally every jedi ever an idiot  i understand the prequel story and that the jedi had many failures  but the idea that the jedi were complete fucking idiots  one and all  it not a satisfying conclusion 
1,yes  because the generic star wars fan on this sub is a young male who just wants badass lightsaber moments and doesn t care about anything else
1,out of training with lightsaber  not the force 
1,the whole point of luke skywalker and peter parker was that fans had someone they could connect with   all nerds dream of being the superhero swinging through the streets  or weilding a lightsaber and defeating bullies   i loved both characters  read all of the eu  including the comics and read spiderman comics   so i totally get where swt is coming from 
1,i m hoping the lando series continues some of the story arcs from solo
1,explain
1,luke being on starkiller out of nowhere would have been neat  would have loved to get an actual fight between like and kylo 
1,one of the biggest problems is the fact that jj is an idiot who would quit working on one of if not the biggest film franchises in history to work on something else
1,disney s brand is very much  we re never wrong   but they do move in reaction to what public thinks   this video   is a good look imo at part of what disney does to stay in line with current times  sequel trilogy is just unique in that we see this reactionism exaggerated and in quick succession   third movie is overreaction to second one which was overreaction to the first one 
1,you misspelled tlj 
1,anything is better than posting braindead felatio like you just did 
1,killing snoke was a pretty dark side thing to do  though  kill the master  take their place  every time someone tried to give kylo a chance  he rejected it and turned further to the dark 
1,    and give his life to save his son and all the things you mentioned ben doing weren t supposed to exist  that s the big issue everyone has with tros palpatine was behind snoke  behind the first order  and seemingly behind the knights of ren as well he was retroactively responsible for everything that happened in the sequels if he had stayed dead after anakin killed him  none of the sequels would have happened bringing him back for lack of a better direction to take  invalidated the whole story of anakin vader 
1,that arc is total filler  there is one thing a very minor detail near the end that s important  but i really dont reccomend it  for the final season  it sure was a waste of 4 episodes 
1,i agree that it was stupid and causes issues in universe  but it was also cool as hell  doesn t make it ok  but stylistically it s appealing
1,but hey we got useless space vegas for half the movie
1,i don t believe that tbh  i assume they had contact with eachother  but i don t believe that tlj s plot points were planned the whole time  given that the foreshadowing in tfa points the complete opposite direction half the time 
1,i was explaining this to someone yesterday  people literally don t understand the difference between storytelling devices and major characters when it comes to star wars  broom boy exists to show us there is hope in the galaxy and that rey is in fact not the last jedi  he wasn t out there to helm his own trilogy or be a major player in any event  and that s okay  will he get fleshed out at some point in some tertiary eu story  probably that s kind of what happens with star wars  but every character that s introduced doesn t need to be a fully fleshed out character with a full arc because that s not how storytelling works 
1,it was going great until the rise of skywalker where they succumbed to the backlash and tried to fan service their way to the finish line
1,you might as well be yelling into a barrel 
1,agreed  tros in particular felt like a jj abrams movie first with star wars second  i found it entertaining on rewatch the producers shouldn t try to please everyone but for me  i would wish for any possible follow up to the mortis themes from the animated shows  the only hint in tros was the word  dyad    i ll take it  ha 
1,i mean yeah we all have different opinions  i was just explaining why alot of adults like me love this movie so much  to you it may be poorly executed but i think they nailed it pretty well 
1,different tastes i suppose  i find the movie very fun and the acting quite good  cheesy dialogue  but then again star wars has always had cheesy dialogue to me  i really enjoy the tragedy of anakin s fall and order 66 and i m never bored throughout the movie  those are the biggest reasons why it s my personal favorite 
1,you re acting like broom boy didn t come from a force sensitive parent  all you guys are talking about is special families  not all jedi came from special families 
1,i think the absence on any plan became blatantly clear after tlj i really like the comparison i heard somewhere  that the sequel trilogy turned into the most expensive twitter spat ever  abrams and johnson pissing over each other   
1,plus that would make rose the third wheel 
1,he got it in the mandalorian and the vast majority praised it  clearly that show got it right
1,revan existed at some point in canon  but all we know is that he was a sith lord 
1,you cannot harness both the dark and the light side  they are exclusionary  the light side is about listening to the force and doing its bidding  while the dark side is about using the force for selfish means  you cannot do both  that s not how this works 
1,very well said to add on to your conclusion  i am all for challenging norms in established franchises  but doing that in the movie right before the conclusion of a 9 film arc  dunno about that one  many of the themes in last jedi would have been great if they were in 7  but having such a huge shift between 7 and 8 and then a huge shift away from that with a ton of retcons in 9 absolutely killed the flow of the trilogy 
1,when luceno wrote  tarkin  he named the emperor sheev palpatine  in this book  he wrote that palpatine got rid of his first name and went by just palpatine  he was a part of a family of naboo nobles called house palpatine and  gt  he became friends with hego damask  darth plagueis   who his father didn t like  palpatine murdered his whole whole family to become his apprentice   lt 
1,yup  just watched that scene last night  in fact  it s a bit cartoonish  but striking 
1,duel of the fates would ve been much better than what we got but i don t think the sequels had the foundation to hold it up  there just wasn t enough character development or world building or sense in the first two movies  maybe they could ve turned that all around in the last act and made a proper chapter in the franchise like revenge of the sith did for the prequels  but not having a plan  or in this case not carrying out the original plan  was only half the issue  the other was just bad story telling 
1, oh yeah i got time    hey can someone bring me a coffee while i m waiting to fly into this big ass energy beam thing that will end the entire rebellion  
1,sand person    with a badass gaffi stick
1,you must have a terrible small mind  tlj was diarrhea 
1,lmfao i m just loving the idea of the same fans who are mad about holdo scene in tlj arguing  science says you can die of a broken heart 
1, this is the nick cage jedi i never knew i needed 
1,my buddy  lol  there was also kid sister
1,old eu had luke using a variant of force lightning
1,the force awakens was ok  but in the end it was just a worse retelling of a new hope the last jedi  is simultaneously the best and the worst movie of the trilogy  it dared  but in the end didnt follow through on its own themes  because by the end of the film nothing had changed and the rise of skywalker is just somebody flinging shit onto canvas rogue one so far has been the only good star wars movie 
1,han could be bitter cus he blames luke for bens fall  one quote does not tie these films together 
1,they even incorporated some fascism imagery in the force awakens with hux s speech  stormtroopers  red banners  etc  it could have been an interesting mirror to our own world where almost 100 years after the nazis were defeated  fascism still exists in some form 
1,i wish they d pick a direction on whether or not force sensitivity was genetic or not  if it is  then masters like mace  obi wan and yoda should be knocking up other masters like aayla  luminara and yaddle to make super jedi 
1,i imagine that s why i m getting downvotes haha   beauty of the human race is we all have our own opinions  in my opinion r1 is in the bottom 3  revenge of the sith bring the best of course 
1,vaapad form does draw on his anger and passion  but he s always at risk of losing control with it  i d argue mace windu  when fighting  is breaking from jedi tenents  but as long as he s fighting for good and channeling these emotions to a worthy goal  then he isn t truly using the dark side

1,the idea that rey is secretly palpatines grand daughter is a good strong story arc of an idea for the new trilogy but just played out so haphazardly if the idea is she is a mole puppet for the emperor to come back and destroy from within  cool  that plays with interesting themes of loyalty and good and evil  are you born bad  is it in the blood  but it isn t setup at all  there s no foreshadowing  no suspense  it s just confusing non sequitors until the the last half hour of ros  they bungled it completely  just look at how we are in love with the mandalorian so much  it respects the world and has setups and pays offs and gives fans largely what they want while telling original compelling emotional stories 
1,lol i get what your saying but technically they were still in atmosphere
1, ¬†old movies¬†  lmao 
1,lol i get what your saying but technically they were still in atmosphere

1,i understand that but the performances  directing  script  pacing  and some of the storytelling choices fall very flat  yes the plot sounds great on paper but it s poorly executed  the novelization by matthew stover is leagues better than the actual movie
1,which is exactly what luke did  so why do we need a new character to recognise this
1,real problem is lack of light saber fights and 2 angsty teens defeating palpatine 
1,and it still makes more sense than anything in tros
1,is this up for available reading somewhere 
1,my nephew was the animator for that video and if i was any more puffed with pride i would explode 
1, gt failing to accomplish anything except  oh you know  defeating palpatine and the empire  including their last grasp at power with the first and final orders   and luke and leia ensuring the jedi live on in some form through their work and teachings  apparently  defeating palpatine   apparently  defeating the empire  and what do they have to show for their labors  after thirty years they are still in caves fighting the empire  luke s an embittered island recluse and what s left of the jedi s teachings fits in a small box oh  and their ot exploits are only remembered by the universe at large as  myth  it was sad and it was bleak  and this is why favreau and filoni are trying their damnedest to fix some of the damage the st did to the franchise  because star wars shouldn t be sad and bleak  it should be uplifting and exciting 
1,sheev yeet 
1,no
1, gt kylo is shown multiple times to have been wounded heavily on his leg  kind of essential for a lightsabre fight  not only that  he was injured by a wookie blaster bolt  which have been shown to kill people with a single shot in the film first of all he is a fucking dark jedi  him being wounded would fuel him with pain which he would then turn into anger  making him even stronger  and even if he was wounded  why was he still able to move around so easily   gt rey has just awakened to a heavy power in the force  which isn t a reason enough to win  what is  is that while yes  she s never used a lightsabre before  she has been shown throughout the movie to be heavily proficient in the use of her staff  a staff isn t a one to one match up for a lightsabre  but it is beleiveable that she would be able to fight well in a melee fight a staff is something entirely different than a lightsaber  also she isin t a master when it comes to fighting with a staff  far from it  a lightsaber requires years of training to master and it would take months to even properly hold it in your hands  without you cutting yourselfs  also rey has shown to randomly use a jedi fucking mindtrick while she just heard of them   gt it was impossible to have a satisfying and well written payoff to rey s parents  no cuz the last jedi did it  which tros then ruined  impossible for snoke  no  none of it was impossible  difficult  some of it  but none of it was impossible he is fully trained dark jedi  teached by both snoke and luke skywalker  it was impossible for him too loose the fight against a girl who s only skill is too use a staff  still wouldnt make any sense that she is suddenly good with a lightsaber because she used a staff once or twice in her life  a sword and staff are two entirely different things  you aren t suddenly able to weild a sword if you trained with a staff all of your life   gt same motivation  a storm trooper who finds his own identity and uses it to run from his problems but grows to learn that his issues won t dissappear without his intervention  rey wants to find her parents and stay exactly on the planet she was on  yet luke wanted to do the opposite  he wants to find the adventure while rey rejects it  just because they changed a few things doesnt suddenly mean the story is good  finn went from caring about his fellow stormtrooper who died in his arms  to murdering them all 10 minutes later  rey wants to go back to a planet which is probably overrun with stormtroopers when she returns  she can t go back there  the first order probably left behind tons of spy s and stormtroopers in case she comes back  the new character are mostly original i agree  but the story went absolutely no where in this movie  leia blindlly trusting finn for no reason even though he could be a bloody spy for all we know  han being too lazy to bring finn and rey directly to the resistance base  starkiller base somehow being build in a span of 30 years  the movie was hot garbage and a big middle finger to the star wars story and lore 
1,they didn t even have the balls to get finn to tell rey whatever it was he was thinking and wanted to tell her the entire fucking movie
1,having rey  learn from lukes mistake  and embrace the dark side is shitty because luke was supposed to have done that in return of the jedi  he was supposed to be the balance in the force    so they erased that idea so that their new hero can be the true one to do it 
1,  
1,i m not arguing he s needed  i m explaining tlj s theme and why he s in the last shots of the film 
1,have a look at the making of before claiming  ¬†whole movie is cgi¬†  
1,literally the only good thing from rise of skywalker
1,he lost the star wars 
1,you bring up an excellent point  i have a feeling there s some legal reason or fear of litigation as to why disney has not pursued the deepfake route that is superior  while it is one thing  like what you said  for a fan to create their own deepfake for non profit and the amusement of themselves and others  it is quite another for a multi billion dollar company to do the same with the goal being the monetizing of the end result fans can pull whatever video and image source they want to get the best result without fear of consequences  at least for the time being a large company with deep pockets can t escape notice so easily this reminds me of when crispin glover sued the producers of back to the future 2 for recycling footage from the first film without paying him  he set a precedent if i remember correctly and apparently  according to the wikipedia article  sag now bars the use of an actor s likeness in some cases  though the way the article section is written it doesn t make it clear which methods are barred  having another actor impersonate the original actor or using footage from another film  while cgi and creating a deepfake using sourced archival footage would likely both cost disney money  which would ultimately be more expensive  that i do not know  i could see it going either way   i m not in the entertainment world and what little i know about law  i learned from matlock 
1,will the first line could be referring to the clone war but not the purge  the war itself was a trap for the jedi but like qui gon said in tpm  his fate is uncertain  in regards to anakin  so to me had things been different anakin could have sided with mace and killed palpatine in rots  the middle seems like filler and the last part is what he know sometimes less is more 
1,i m just mad about space horses not developing hypoxia 
1,blocked
1,this is the way
1,the movie by itself is pretty bad  if you watched the clone wars  then the movie is much better because anakin s fall is fleshed out and there is just a much bigger impact  i m currently reading the rots novel right now as well  and it s widely known for being 10x better than the movie  it really dives into what each character is thinking and shows how severely flawed anakin is 
1,prequel trilogy had 20 years to develop with 3 movies and a  100 episode long series together with countless books sequel trilogy had  only  been around since 5 years give it some time 
1,it is my least favorite star war   i never could get with the tone of it   it s far sadder that i desire from the galaxy far far away   it s why i also am not a huge fan of rogue one  a very good movie but not one i ever sit down to watch   there is little fun in the movie and while some set pieces are cool and it s got that great lizard sound effect there is nothing that draws me back except during a full cinematic watch through i also don t like that it is a point of no return for star wars in general with the pg 13 rating   the first 3 movies are so wonderfully family entertainment without making concessions for a family rating   at the time there was no pg 13 but even today they are very pg   the first 2 prequels managed to maintain that family core while still being every bit a star war  quality being a subjective point    i know the rating is an odd thing to get stuck on but   shrug 
1,  
1,if star wars x doesn t start off with  somehow  jar jar isa back  the  new  new republic isan big poodoo   i say we riot and take down the mouse s castle 
1,it didn t have to mirror it  imo  the sequel trilogy was strongest when it wasn t trying to do  original trilogy 2 0  
1,it s confirmed real by colin treverrow himself  it used to be available on r starwarsleaks  but it seems the tweet with the link has been deleted
1,han says in tfa   one boy  an apprentice  turned against him  destroyed it all  luke felt responsible  he just walked away from everything   i think the events of tlj are a logical follow up to this quote 
1,even the title is more hype
1,i agree  the script would have had fresh ideas and fleshed out a unique story  the issue i had with rise if skywalker is going back on all the new ideas rian introduced  it fell flat because it mirrored return of the jedi too much 
1,it would ve been good that way   if you read dawn of the jedi   into the void  the jedis  predecessors were all essentially grey  using both sides of the force 
1,i tried so hard to push through but like you i just couldn t stand the writing style 
1,or even poe and ben
1,it would be the same in a reversed timeline  people would hate on dotf and praise this unreleased version of a jj script 
1,while that was an interesting script  one part goes against a lot of the canon  the whole point of the dark side  is that it always corrupts and there is no way out of that  it s why grey jedi can never be canon 
1,i feel like i m 50 years  i want to see all of this rebooted  who knows what new technology we may have  but take the opportunity to keep the great parts and get rid of the bad parts  if they do it as a high budget series  we could get a longer  fuller story that better tells the tale from beginning to end  no more jumping around the timeline with different stories 
1,as it should  tlj needs to be undone 
1,  
1,i agree it s a problem but just one of very very many
1,it s real
1,i think there is ambiguity in the jedi  compare the pt jedi order to luke s jedi order in the eu  or with revan s philosophy in the revan book  i even find ambiguity in the sith code  there isn t anything inherently evil or dark in the sith code  could someone follow the sith code and not fall to the dark side  i do think jedi are absolutely preferable to sith when it comes to the good of the galaxy  and while kotor is amazing and i would kill for a 3rd one  the prequels do show that the jedi are fallible and flawed  and i ve yet to see the sith being portrayed anywhere as anything but evil  and the more morally complex stories such as this should remain in supplemental material only i think 
1,and yet i think its the best  movie  of the sequels 
1, gt   somehow  palpatine returned     and managed to secretly construct a fleet of 1000 star destroyers and recruit a massive army  which is worthless   
1,i disagree  when watching tlj and esb they feel like district  great  films  the same can t be said for tfa and anh
1,oh they will be retconned hard in 5 years we will be talking about how they changed so much about the sequels through books  comics  and tv  they re already doing it  they aren t gonna throw them out  but they will try to put band aids on the ridiculous parts of those flicks 
1,thats because abrams is terrible at building tension  i hated the abrams star trek movies for the same reason  lots of flash  lots of things happening  and yet none of it feels invigorating
1,rogue 1 is the best star wars movie 
1,imagine being hired after tfa and you ask jj for details on what he was planning with all of his plot and mystery set ups  and he s like  who gives a fuck  do what you want   then you do what you want and jj shows up after your movie to shit on you in interviews because you didn t follow the plan 
1,dunno  in mandalorian  or better yet in return of the jedi itself  luke s shown to be capable of dipping his toe into the dark side but ultimately staying true to the light  and old canon  i believe  had even more of that not that i think rey s a good character  but the sequels are already the ogs but worse  no need to turn her even more into luke but worse 
1,it also opens up time for games  books  tv series  etc 
1, gt  defeating palpatine and the empirethe empire was still around  just called the first order  literally exact same organization other than all of their ships and walkers were scaled to 2x instead of 1x  they even had a death star that was scaled up to 5x    and luke didn t defeat palpatine according to epix  palpatine just fell back to another location where he managed to gather an army and a fleet of 1000 star destroyers   somehow  
1,my biggest problems with the sequels   1  they are bad movies from a technical point of view  just compare the light saber duels from the prequels with the sequels  especially tros is just a mess   2  they push female characters just because they are female  not because they are interesting characters  i think everyone would have loved a trilogy about ahsoka tano  also they pretty much ruined luke  lea and han   3  the story is unoriginal  lazy and often just dumb   they should have made a new saga and leave the skywalker saga where it was also  different directors was a horrible decision  a big part of both tlj and tros was  correcting  things the previous director established and they didn t like 
1,i mostly agree  but i think you underestimate the role tlj had in setting up the failure  the biggest problem is that tlj did not want to work as a trilogy  almost no plot threads prior to tlj still existed at the end of it  and even most plot threads in tlj end in the movie rather than setting up future points esb sets up han s rescue  the emperor as the main antagonist  vader as a major threat and focus of luke s future character development  leia and han s romance  etc  tlj destroys the rebel fleet  the first order fleet  snoke  rey s parentage  and luke  and resolves all character arcs it starts  one builds up to the future  the other aims to tie up all loose ends  resulting in 3 standalone movies rather than a continuous trilogy 
1,you do not understand star wars and what teri balance means  one cannot  just accept darkness  you become aware of it and acknowledge it  but never harness it even a little  that is the pathway of the dark side  george lucas says that true balance in the force is the absence of the dark side 
1,this would be so much better  i liked tfa  absolutely loved tlj but tros just didn t make sense  this concept ticks all the boxes for me
1,so i m gonna clear up what some other commenters have stated  first there has been a significant fan base of the prequels for years  even prior to the sequels   people forget that the people who grew up with the prequels like myself are now adults with jobs and all that and it wasn t until recent years that we got a voice online  in terms of your actual question  revenge of the sith is my all time favorite movie for so many reasons  it s a tragic story and that ma something we don t see alot in movies like this  especially compared to the sequels and ot where the trilogies end with a  happy ending   you say the dialogue is trash and the story isn t any good but there s so much genius behind the story  it s the culmination of a 1000 year plot by the sith to take over the galaxy and the downfall of this selfless young man into something terrifying  the movie shows the flaws of this jedi order that was referenced back in the 70s and 80s trilogy and how it was arrogance and denial  concepts jedi stand against  that ultimately led to their own destruction  the genius behind the sith evolving into politicans instead of these typical warriors seem thousands of years prior just showed how the sith were ready to adapt  the jedi were fighting an enemy that was in a form they couldn t recognize  the heartbreak behind an army of clones with their own feelings and thoughts being programmed to enact an entire genocide of monks is one of the movies strong points  what i really love about the movie is the amount of different locations we get to see in the galaxy  in the orginals and in the sequels we see a total of like 5 planets in each trilogy  in episode 3 alone we see so many unique and mew planets with different life forms and terrain  so much thought went into the design of the many settings seen in the story  ewan mcgregor has obiwan is the best preformance of the movie  you see this jedi master who we see as the perfect jedi fall apart after learning the boy he essentialy raised for over a decade has become this servant of evil and the emotion he showed after realising that he s can t save anakin is beautifully written  i get some of the lines in the movie are a bit ehh but the story and the thought given to the characters the the wider galaxy is honestly enough to make up for some of the off moments  i hope this clarifies a but why people love this movie and why a significant amount of people actually say this is the best star wars movie  this movie has everything in my eyes 
1,if d amp d won t redo game of thrones season 7 and 8 then   why would this be any different  there were more people disappointed in the got ending than the st ending  i think it s okay not to like the last trilogy  you can exclude it from cannon in your mind  as far as i am concerned season 7 and 8 happened differently   
1,yes i agree 7 did no favors for anyone that would have had to make 8 work  plus it just felt underwhelming being a sort of reboot in a massive galaxy with a ton of potential for really interesting ideas if the books or games are anything to go by  i imagine how cool a series or trilogy would be if it was as compelling as kotor2 i have plenty of issues with 8 and 9  which align with what most people dislike about them  but at least i can get some contrarian enjoyment from 8 and appreciate luke s kreia like phase followed by cool binary sunset redemption  and some campy enjoyment over palpatine s comedic evilness in 9 plus the obvious hints to rey s lineage  but 7 leaves me with nothing 
1,tl dr  sequels bad  upvote me
1,i don t think colin trevorrow of jurassic world  cringe  fame was really the savior of the sequels 
1,it was so obvious    it s like the darth before a siths name  it would make it so that rey wasn t just taking someone s last name but instead making it into a title 
1,  
1,rey was trained as a jedi by leia
1,one must be trained as a jedi to be one  that path can take many different avenues  but it all leads back to the jedi order itself
1,it really wouldn t be that common to be able to convince people to kamikaze  and building a capital ship is a very costly endeavor  the resistance probably only had a few  ships like the raddus were more valuable to the resistance than the upside in blowing them upi don t like the prequels and i didn t love bringing kamikaze tactics too heavily into the story  but theres lots of logistical problems in sw throughout  this one is pretty far down my  extensive  list of gripes about the sequels
1,  
1,ok    and anakin wasn t the only one with a high mid count  you re being very pedantic with two quotes vs hundreds of hours of examples of how that wasn t only applied to those two   the point being is that broom boy is not needed  we already had 1000 s of broom boys in the pt 
1,never say never  they wiped canon once already  but i doubt it   dont come at me with the  eu was never canon  bs they are already rewriting sequel era lore in comics  books   amp  the mandalorian  while they arent going to throw them out they are at the very least going to heavily retcon the events of the sequels if it were to me  they would just slap a  legends  logo on those movies and move on  post rotj era is where the interest is  the sequels didnt make the lasting pop culture impact they wanted to 
1,idk  i remember yoda being adamantly against having any fear at all
1,because tlj s unholy trash that ruins everything about star wars 
1,disagree tlj screwed them over  tros tried it s been best to make all nine films cohesive  but ended up making the trilogy disjointed  i love tros though 
1,so she would be han and leia s daughter other than luke i think that fits best and makes it a brother vs sister story like the sequels were originally planned to be
1,  
1,oops  corrected with vii 
1,in tfa they managed to have a project larger than a death star  starkiller base  and blew up the entire new republic government planets with it  i can t reconcile that level of power with them being a scrappy terrorist force 
1,i think that that would have been an amazing idea 
1,sure thing  kid 
1,from what i heard the script sounded cool
1,but also the middle  the bendu says multiple times that he is neither light nor dark
1,fuck me that would have been awesome  im truly dissapointed ill never be able to see this 
1,i mean  the current canon is that the force does exist in a dichotomy  the brother and the sister 
1,yeah disney isn t going to redo the sequels  the best shot at a better sequel trilogy would be whatever filoni and favs are cooking up with their tv series   i m betting on an adaptation of heir to the empire 
1,no  can we stop asking this every day
1,i m on this sub  i m debating with someone who doesn t want to actually argue their point because they know it sucks
1, risk taking  isn t a description that fits disney  even pixar dosen t deviate too much from their usual harmless fair 
1,no  tlj killed it  it was an abomination  ros almost saves it 
1,i think the jedi are wrong to suppress their emotions  emotions are not good or bad  they just are  it s how you react and use your emotions that determines good or evil  a jedi can feel anger or fear  but then they should calm themselves and ideally let go of it or fix the cause of the anger or fear peacefully if possible  but acting out of anger or fear is what can lead to the dark side  just like in real life you want to have a level head and deal with a problem intelligently and not just lash out when afraid or angry 
1,i think it s honestly a combinations of everything  trevarrow also had a stinker  critically at least  in book of henry which also spurred rumors of replacement it did absolutely suffer from not having a firm outline vision for the trilogy though  that doesn t mean each movie can t be its own thing and honestly i wouldn t change much about 7 and 8 but they would have both benefitted from knowing what they would be before shooting  as it is  it feels disconnected  i do agree about duel of the fates  i read the leak and i was actively mad they didn t try to stick with that more  i do think it would have been much more cohesive with the 7 and 8 that we got but still would ve felt disconnected  i really truly believe that if episodes 7  8 and 9 were instead episodes 10  11 and 12  12 would still need a lot of work  then they would ve been received much better  i said this after 8 was released but it should be so evident post mandalorian  for the vast majority of anyone whose seen star wars  seeing luke function entirely in his prime is the thing we ve wanted more than anyone  now  i love tlj luke  i completely buy he s where he s at but it s still just not what i wanted to see  i m so friggin tired of the reluctant hero story  it s one of the chief ongoing problems with batman movies is that most of the time he can t wait to stop being batman what i do believe is at least episodes 7 and 8 will age so much better now that fav roni are exploring the time but i m rambling  to summarize  i think you definitely identified a problem but reality is i really think it s a combination of all of them and i do think the not planning beforehand enabled the other problems to occur just my two cents 
1,is the rise of skywalker post tlj the first time disney scrambled to course correct based on public outcry criticism  they seem like a  we re never wrong  and would never admit it if we were because we can t be  type whereas  as you said  elsewhere in the world  the snyder cut  eventually gets released lol
1,at present  it seems like rogue squadron  the upcoming film from patty jenkins  will be
1,i had no idea this existed oh  and now i am super mad haha
1,what s their incentive to really do so the movies collectively made more money than the gdp of some small countries and at least two of them were critically very well received on the whole  as a business decision the complicated messaging of invalidating those movies makes absolutely no sense 
1,if someone at disney developed a aneurysm and suddenly decides that the compaby needs to cater to insular internet communities  they would open a pandoras box  if people realises that enough complaining and crying can change major company decidions we would never get anything again
1,of the nine skywalker films  only three of them dared to make plot decisions that would move the story and mythos forward  every single other film in the franchise were just marketing responses to those choices  rather than a continuation of those choicesthose three films were a new hope  the empire strikes back  and the last jediedit   a word
1,not gonna happen 
1,right  i mean  in the old canon  cloned palpatine returned  twice   with greater than death star superweapons  and threatened the galaxy yet again with his overwhelming military force and huge fleets of starships  hell  luke even went over to the dark side  we had numerous resurgences of imperial forces  conflicts  heck  we even got a complete galactic invasion that made palpatine look like a puppy dog none of that stuff impacted how i viewed the original movies  what the sequel trilogy has done is peanuts in comparison to some stuff that used to be canon  dae suncrusher le bestiest superweapon   
1,i put it in the middle tier  lots of bad scenes but lots of great scenes  anakin vs dooku is great  the space battle above coruscant is cool  order 66 is great  great score  i don t like anakin vs obi thoughprobably my 5th fav of the movies
1, deleted 
1,neither do the prquels
1,all of that was stuff they did in the ot  that the st comes along and says they really didn t actually do at all   they have only lost from where they were in the ot 
1,no  please go away
1,star wars fans can easily be happy  see mandalorian reception  they key to satisfying your fanbase is making content they want to watch  with the sequel trilogy they just didn t hit that mark 
1,that is a great explanation  it s not the cgi it s self that s bad  but the way it s used  like the cgi was prioritized over other concerns like acting or world building 
1,pretty good   i say that about almost any alternative to episode 9 though   
1,i had the cd audio books where kyle went to get the plans  and then jyn erso is the one    it s weird  cause in reddit only the canon is law  and fun facts are dismissed  and the films are law  but the films killed off alot of real good characters and events
1,i think all three have the same major flaw  they don t work with the prior movie s   tfa goes  hey remember the new republic  the biggest reward of the last 6 movies  yeah no hit undo on that shit  we re back to empire and rebels   tlj goes  hey remember the hints that rey s parents were important  and that there would be an important moment with rey passing the torch to luke  and that snoke would be the big bad  yeah no hit undo on that shit  i want to do something unrelated to the foreshadowing   tros goes  hey remember both the first order and rebels losing their entire fleets and kylo deciding to be independent and luke destroying palpatine  yeah no hit undo on that shit  we re bringing back plapatine as the main villain and the rebels are back in numbers 
1,kylo wasn t a servant of palpatine  remember palp said  kill rey   and kylo never tried  he had other plans  and palpatine knew it  it was all reverse psychology to get rey to exegol
1,no  i m saying i m not gonna waste my time  if you re genuinely interested as to why people don t like tlj  i recommend checking out r starwars 
1,bro kylo is literally space hitler  why does everyone forget he took out hundreds of planets 
1, i don t believe it  that is why you fail 
1,for everything cool the fates script had in it  it had 3 awful decisions 
1,what are you talking about  there are only three indiana jones movies and none of them have that title   
1,rey s hand reaching up and grabbing the lightsaber as it comes towards the camera is one of my favorite shots in any star wars film 
1,ah so your argument to me is that i should just assume a character existing is a flaw in a movie  without explaining yourself  solid 
1,disclaimer  i  like  tlj  i hoped tros would have improved it  also  from some new expanded universe stuff i ve seen  the first order was  a lot more interesting during the cold war period when they could be used as actually slightly subtle space nazis instead of over the top  think the nazis from the early indiana jones films that have limited authority and are concerned about being the face of law and order  i feel like tros would have been much better if it had baked for another year or two  it s got a lot of good stuff   well acted   some great set pieces like the fight on the ds wreckage our the rey kylo hand off sequence the bits that bothered me   the plot feels forced and just kind of boring  sure  tfa was kind of a knock off of anh  but there was at least fun characters in it   the plot was rushed  no foreshadowing to the whole  emperor s not dead  plot element  for example   it relied on a lot of stuff that either didn t matter  most of the c3p0 plot felt kind of like a waste when it was done  the dagger worked despite rey being in a practically random location    the last combat felt like a bad knock off of the infinity war ending  with everyone showing up  the big difference is in iw everyone got to  do something meaningful  in the last fight  here  the main relevant was just being there  a big comparison to rotj is at least the fleet in that movie is important  it s suggested that even if luke had  the emperor that the ds2 would still be a huge threat  here there s a bunch of star destroyers which are certainly potential threats  but in a much less immediate or interesting way   this is related to many of the above  but missing from tros is any real sort of  then gang are back together and it s awesome  moments  at least in rotj we feel like we have an actual team of characters going in to the final conflict  whereas the groups are separate in tros i feel like carrie fisher s death made a lot of plots difficult  but in general i wanted something better  my  dream version  is that it s a few years after tlj and the big conflict is that the first order has a crack formed because hux and kylo ren aren t capable of ruling individually  so have a toxic relationship of ren as the  spiritual  leader  with his knights and such as inquisitor types ruling from the ds2 ruins  and hux as the military industrial complex ruler  who knows where the bodies are buried and can get stuff done  but is not really capable of compelling endless loyalty   not sure how it d progress  but the resistance would have to exploit this  also  ren and hux would each have their own  advisors  of sorts  kylo would have ghost emperor and ghost like as something akin to the  shoulder angel shoulder devil  trope  while hux would probably have less interesting military and corporate advisors   
1,they still could have had a time jump  they did  not need to pick back up from luke and rey on the cliff main charters could have not been separated the entire film kylo being injured didn t mattersnoke didn t have to be a complete joke rey never needed to know what happened to her parents  or they could have explained her parents luke could have had an actual reason for leaving  han was borderline senile so his interpretation is extremely questionable  rian could have done any number of things to  actually expand on tfa  don t get me wrong   tfa sucked too  but rian was not pigeonholed into doing anything  he botched it big time in my opinion and gave us by far the worst star wars film 
1,i m married bitch 
1,woah  that s wild  i hadn t heard of this  but i ll be diving into that rabbit hole for sure however  my hot take on the cancellation it sounds like ep 9  dotf would have rather neatly capped off a lot of plotlines for disney    and considering how much they paid for it  and how much they made from the movies so far  they want to keep milking that cash cow  as they say  follow the money 
1,my response 
1,  
1,seriously  this is a multi billion dollar franchise  get a freaking show runner to plan out the trilogy  broad strokes are fine  and let the directors fill in the details 
1,the dead speak but only in a fortnight map    
1,no  they should stop making star wars movies and move on 
1,i feel like this is a dig at how some people bring up contextless inconsistencies between the ot pt and st  showing that it can be done both ways
1,not much  luke and leia make out  and leia mentions knowing her biological mother  but otherwise the movies are pretty consistent  narratively anyways   quality wise  it varies 
1,anything released on an international scale is going to get death threats for any number of reasons  you can t hold basic political opinions in 99  of the world without catching a few death threats  its a moot point 
1,but wait  here s another empire waiting in the wings  and they have the same emperor  yeah     really accomplished a lot there 
1,the audacity   how dare you view things by their own merit rather than by some things other people made up much later
1,like i said  don t worry about it 
1,no it s done  people will get over it eventually
1,i m someone who believes it to be the best star wars movie  i love it because it s not only the birth of vader but it s also the movie that inspires the most in depth analysis  it makes us question the jedi order and whether or not they re actually a force for good ian mcdiarmid is absolutely delightful  yes he s a little silly but he s so much fun to watch  christiansen has an impossible task and he honestly does well in my opinion  lastly  the visuals are outstanding  mustafar looks great  grievous is well generated and the scenes in space and coruscant look awesome
1,this is why i thought they should have ditched all of the previous star main characters all together except in reference or a 1 scene shot  the star war series is like a tug of war between the old characters and new characters that made it uninteresting  old characters teaching new characters  but also stealing the spotlight  maybe they were just waiting for rian johson to write a completely new star war trilogy on the next round  but because tlj was soo trashed by  fans  that we might never see new star wars or there will be riots if there isn t a whole montage of old characters being brought back to life again to appease the  fans   when palpatine was announced for nostalgia s sake  all the  fans  were happy and excited  but now when the tros came out everyone is suddenly crying about why they brought him back  you can t win with the fans  you just need to go with what is right 
1,lmao
1,i d argue that qui gon was a light sided jedi through and through  he just listened to the will of the force instead of the jedi council 
1,i would be  the owner   a death stick addict on coruscant who thinks he owns the galaxy 
1,from someone else in this thread  so maybe not true  supposedly  trevor asked to keep luke alive at the end of tlj after fisher s passing and both jj and kennedy said no leading to trevor walking away 
1,we do know that because george lucas and lucasfilm have been incredibly explicit about this for 15 years now
1,i don t really like the sequels because they don t stay true to the original cannon
1,i never read any of the books in the expanded universe so i could be way off on this  but seeing the concept art for duel of the fates illicits the same kind of feeling that i would get from the expanded universe from the 90s it had this darkness and dirtiness about it  and that s the same feeling i d get from seeing the book covers at the library or playing shadows of the empire i even started the heir to the empire audiobook  and so far it gives me that same atmospheric feeling that i don t think i have gotten from anything else in star wars i would have loved to see how that could have played out in colin s movie 
1,i think in the discussion of the sequel trilogy post tros i think people underestimate the importance of endings when discussing a larger piece of work  the ending to something is often the overruling factor in how people remember movies  in the case of the sequel trilogy it ended with a movie that seemed scared more than anything else  leaving an underwhelming taste in people s mouth definitely unfortunate as i also really like tfa and tlj to this day and i agree with a lot of what you ve said here about the production of the trilogy as a whole  saddens me the story those two movies will built will always be sacked with an unsatisfactory conclusion 
1,umm    let me remind you of a character who got redeemed after killing hundreds of children anakin went waayyyyy more evil than kylo  like anakin was megahitler levels of evil 
1, deleted 
1,eh    i think tros is the only bad one in the bunch  i liked tfa  i thought that despite its flaws  it did a good job of bringing star wars back   loved tlj but yeah  it could have been so much more if they didn t recycle so much 
1,  
1,yousa in big doo doo this sa time
1,a boy born a slave to a slave on a shitty back water that gets rescued by a group of monks who refuse to let him see his mother or to buy her freedom with their considerable resources he grows up in this religious order and falls in love with a friend from childhood but is forbidden to act on it  he is then made a general in a galaxy spanning war and witnesses atrocities for years before being used to topple the government he serves  fights his mentor and best friend to the death  is robbed of his body  and is made the servant of an evil sorcerer  his kids are spirited off to foster parents without his knowledge they exist  one becomes a professional politician and has it pretty easy  the other is a farm kid on the same planet in the ass end of the galaxy his dad was from  is isolated from society and forbidden to seek his passion by his adopted parents  he meets up with his father s mentor  only to watch him die as soon as they became friends  he then is thrust into war himself  witnesses atrocities  and then learned his father was the person who killed his mentor  this is after his dad has tried to kill him multiple times  he then had to fight his dad to the near death to save his life and rebellion  what exactly about these people isn t depressing 
1,i liked the chemistry between the actors in the scenes on pasaana and kijimi  wish we had more of that
1,come friends    r saltierthancrait would love to have all this saltiness fuck the st   absolute garbage hey let s just redo anh and make it a bigger death star now   so fucking stupid  all they had to do was the thrawn trilogy and it would have smashed   adapt heir the empire for film  consult with timothy zahn and bam  you got your self a shake n bake box office smash  but nooooo 
1,because they don t mention it  han s dad is only mentioned for a throw away line to set up han instantly mastering the falcon
1,wait gt kylo dies evilnevermind i dont think this wouldve been better guys
1,so in other words  you cant read
1,if you think han was the same character in tfa as he was in the ot then you werent paying attentionhan in tfa was a broken man mourning the loss of his son  he regressed to being a smuggler again  but it felt different than what he was like as a young man  it felt like an old man running from his life 
1,it seems to be legit and while it seems to be an improvement  except for some ideas  we ll never know  it would heavily depend on the execution of the story  also it seems quite long  it s only one draft of the script  so there were probably going to be changed  for better or worse  we can speculate all we want whether it would have been better  or just be happy with what we got  i heard rumours that they might make an animated version of the film  but i don t believe that
1,  
1,the real problem is that disney would rather thsnk the chinese gestapo  than earn less from one country that s the real problem 
1,harry gregson williams and j√≥hann j√≥hannsson are quite good  the latter unfortunately passed away a couple of years ago  his soundtrack for the arrival and sicario are amazing  he often worked with denis villeneuve who is directing the new dune movie  j√≥hann would have likely been the one to score it for him 
1, deleted 
1,finallysomeone else who likes tlj
1,i honestly don t understand what the complaint about rose or the complaint about rey s story is the complaint about snoke dying makes absolutely no sense  unless your argument is the st should have just had palpatine 2 0 as the big bad 
1,exactly 
1,they ve been having issues since episode vii  but lucasfilm did nothing about it 
1,yes and no  lucasfilm has their official canon that al their storytelling is to work withbut canon can be whatever you want  if you want to use kyle katarn instead of jyn erso  that s your choice  and very few people will fault you for it
1, gt  you want to source that quote  because the first ever reference to a midi cholrian was the pm script in the mid 90s i mean  it s literally right there   the making of star wars  by jw rinzler
1,they didn t meet until she saved them in tlj   she introduced herself and he said   i know      probably tlj trying to recreate the  i know  moment from esb 
1,then i guess it got broken when qui gon first spoke to yoda in clone wars 
1, gt the whole fight was litterally kylo being not able to use a lightsaber for some reason even though luke fucking skywalker traineƒè him  and somehow rey won the duel while the only thing she did was trying to stab him  the first point i agree with  this one i do not  reasons rey one that fight fairly1  kylo is shown multiple times to have been wounded heavily on his leg  kind of essential for a lightsabre fight  not only that  he was injured by a wookie blaster bolt  which have been shown to kill people with a single shot in the film 2  rey has just awakened to a heavy power in the force  which isn t a reason enough to win  what is  is that while yes  she s never used a lightsabre before  she has been shown throughout the movie to be heavily proficient in the use of her staff  a staff isn t a one to one match up for a lightsabre  but it is beleiveable that she would be able to fight well in a melee fight kylo has a heavy disadvantage  underestimating rey and having a serious injury aswell as rey being proficient with a melee weapon and basic force skills is why it s makes sense she won the fight  gt it was impossible to make a sequel to this because of the fact that it was so similair to a new hope  thats why the last jedi was also very similair to the empire strikes back  because rian was backed into a corner  it was impossible to have a satisfying and well written payoff to rey s parents  no cuz the last jedi did it  which tros then ruined  impossible for snoke  no  none of it was impossible  difficult  some of it  but none of it was impossible  gt no it wasn t  most of the motivations where the exact same as in a new hope  the rebels are looking for a droid because it contains important information  they have to blow a giant planet killing weapon etc etc  the movie was god awfull in my opinion  but i am glad you found something to like in it same motivation  a storm trooper who finds his own identity and uses it to run from his problems but grows to learn that his issues won t dissappear without his intervention  rey wants to find her parents and stay exactly on the planet she was on  yet luke wanted to do the opposite  he wants to find the adventure while rey rejects it  let s go over and compare a scene that some say is a copy  cantina  in tnh it acts as a launching point for the adventure  luke and obi wan meet jan and chewie  teach some scum in the cantina a lesson and make an escape on a high point  tfa  it acts as the mid point the characters lowest point  they go there for info  and while fin tries to run the first order attacks and takes the one good thing he had found since he left the first order  rey  it ends on a very low note and launches fins character change  as for characters  luke   rey  not at all  there motivations are very much the opposite  and there personalitys differ aswell  a brash cocky kid craving adventure who thinks he knows best  a girl abandoned who holds onto false hope that someone will come for her  who is skilled in survival after having to fight alone for so long  fin    not han  not luke  i really don t know  han    acts as a mentor sure  but acts as not only the obi wan role  but also the han  strange  kylo vader  no  kylo is a child who isn t sure of himself  trying to live up to a false idea of vader  he s nowhere near the calm cold powerhouse vader was  despite trying to be  i enjoy this film  its ok if you don t  but just wanted to point some flaws i saw in your arguments 
1,i personally don t really care for a redeemed kylo ren  having him die bad doesn t neccesarily have to be sad  they could have the theme to be to learn from his mistakes  i just think it s kinda silly to have the character who s first act in the new trilogy was to murder a village  and second act to murder billions on multiple planet to be redeemed  imo at least
1, gt  it s absurd that people are still pretending it s some great revelation that rey was a  nobody  simply because they want to defend tlj  i am not pretending it s a great revelation  i am not defending tlj i am stating that that is the theme of the film and that broom boy is the punctuation on that theme no idea where you re drawing any other conclusions here i m happy to debate whether tlj is good or not  i think it is   but that s not the discussion we re having 
1,agreed  no one can use the words   i know  like poe did in tlj without those words being a heavy allusion to romance within the star wars universe i think it actually fits poe and rey s characters very well  and the setup was great  i didn t see it coming  but loved its simplicity when it did  but then immediately seeming to be immensely annoyed by each other at the beginning of tros was whiplash my fandom still hasn t recovered from lol
1,how much time did redeemed anakin get  i feel it kinda mirrored that 
1,i still can t forgive the last jedi for canonizing the ridiculously destructive powers of building a giant hunk of metal with hyperspace boosters on it and being able to destroy any ship in the galaxy no matter how large or expensive it is  why do ships fight each other with dinky laser guns and bombing runs when they could just have a fleet of 50 ton hunks of metal with a hyperspace drive and droid pilot  all starship battles we see in the future will now be stupid as shit because we all know they would win the battle instantly using this strategy 
1, gt if they really wanted to do a follow up  there were some amazing stories in the old eu they could have drawn fromthat s all they really had to do   instead we got rey and  ben   why is his name fucking ben it makes no sense 
1,yup  i knew that but thx anyway
1, but how are we supposed to make the audience curious about who their parents were if we don t keep bringing it up constantly  how are we supposed to make our audiences be mystified by the mystery box if they forget it s even there    s 
1,why do some people have more force sensitivity  genetics it s right there and it was right there in 1977  too  from his interview with carol titelman in 1977  the force gives you the power to have extrasensory perception and to be able to see things and hear things  read minds and levitate things  it is said that certain creatures   are born   with a higher awareness of the force than humans  their brains are different    they have more midi chlorians in their cells     the making of star wars  by jw rinzlerif you have quotes where lucas says the force has no genetic component  please provide them 
1,he s definitely up there for me as well  given what we know about rogue squadron it seems like it may be set after tros which gives me hope that we ll get to see denis lawson take on the role of wedge again which would just be perfect 
1,true  but they don t historically put a lot of spin on the truth  for example   in attack of the clones  dooku told obi wan exactly what was going on and obi wan didn t believe him    in the final episodes of the clone wars  maul tells ahsoka exactly what sideous  intentions are with anakin  he even has the better plan to stop what was about to happen   vader tells luke the truth about his parentage when obi wan and yoda lie right to his face    luke initially lies  or at the very least intentionally omits key details  to rey about what happened with ben while kylo was up front to her about everything  when you start looking for it  it starts presenting itself everywhere 
1, best i can do is this picture of the best star wars ship  
1,i m gonna have to disagree on some of these points  while i do think abrams left tfa in a weird way  i don t think rian was nearly as pidgeonholed as this makes him out to be  i personally think he just wasn t focusing on tradition and wanted to destroy that rigid adherence to the star wars legacy        the next movie can t have a time jump    it absolutely can  have the film open with rey handing luke the saber  luke reacts  cut forward 5 years to deal with the aftermath of that first encounter  good or bad  no corner  odd to have a time jump right at the beginning  sure  but better than not having one at all      separates the main characters    i see this less as a problem and more of an avenue to take  how do the main characters get back to eachother over the course of this movie  add in the potential time jump and it s even easier  no corner     kylo ren is injured    which pushes him further down the dark side and makes him feel closer to his grandfather  or it could be a  slap in the face  that makes him start questioning which side he s on  no corner here       snoke  aka evil old ugly baddie 2 0 exists    snoke could have been so many things  a puppet for palpatine  a usurper who doesn t understand that he s fucking with skywalkers  an ancient sith exile back from the outer rim  etc  you could do so much with that      rey needs to know what happened to her parents    again  there are multiple options  her parents being nobody i thought was actually awesome  should ve stuck with that  also  luke didn t find out who his pappy really was until episode 5       luke abandoned everyone to the point where han solo died    this is surprising character development  and something interesting to explore in the followup films  so much to unwrap and explore there  you could have a redemption arc  you could make him the sacrifice guy like ben  you could make him go evil  luke experiencing failure does not ruin his character  it allows him to grow and transform and learn      the hero beats the villain in the first movie  which goes against typical story structure    except episode 4 ends with luke and the rebellion blowing up the death star and getting medals  and episode 1 ends with naboo saved and darth maul destroyed  destroying palpatines plans up to that point  also they got medals  perhaps people should ve gotten more medals at the end of tfa     empire vs  rebels 2 0    yeah i didn t like this either  it was unoriginal and they could ve done something cooler  i think they just didn t know how to have the big space battles and space military that people like without repeating their predecessors  they took the easy route    all of this to say that i do think johnson had tons of wiggle room and instead chose to  throw away the past   a theme he touches on heavily throughout the film  and do something completely different and unexpected  when that blew up in their  disney s  face and fans started trashing tlj  they panicked and stopped being interesting  went straight back to source material and refused to continue the story johnson had told  they panicked so bad that they literally gutted their own story and made it almost nonsensical just to be more  fan friendly  
1,they re right though  someone that has seen the movie outside of the bubble that was tlj bitching  it s not criticism when actors are personally attacked  taking quotes out of context or blaming kk for  everything   will absolutely not care that much 
1,the bigger problem is it s a flawed concept to begin with  stop trying to shoe horn him into a series of films that he quite frankly doesn t belong in  and the problem solves itself  with a guaranteed better end result 
1,atleast with alderon we were made to  see   the impact through leah 
1,because he s emotionally vulnerable  and generally speaking  fellas don t like that in a villain  they want to them to be intimidating   that s the reason that the scene at the end of rogue one is so popular
1,i felt like they through away an extremely important story arch because of ford  ford got the rdj treatment and they axed him in the first movie  i feel like there should have been a lot of character development througg han for kylo but shelling out another 20 mil wasn t an option
1,also remember tfa s story was actually written back before 1977  so not too much work there  just swapping some names out 
1,  
1,tlj is a movie about how we deal with legacy and the past  that ultimatly rejects the viewpoint held by both luke and kylo to  kill the past   and instead to grow from the mistakes of the past  as such  the big thing i expected episode 9 to deal with would be how rey avoids the mistakes the brought down the previous two jedi orders  i also would have expected continuations of leias theme of  saving what you love  not killing what you hate   and reys search for family  albeit a surrogate one  i also was looking forward to kylo ren as supreme leader  i was curious if they would make him unstable and conflicted  or perhaps swing the other way and have him trying to be a good leader in the midst of a villainous empire  the seeds of a coup against him were set up in tfa and tlj so i was expecting that power play to be a big thing i was not expecting kylo to be relegated to a servant to papa palpatine in the first 30 seconds  or rey being palpatine s somewhat grandaughter
1,thank you so much for posting this   i had no idea   that 4 min summary was 10 000 times better than episode 9 it could have worked without leia   i cannot believe we missed out on this ending   would have been perfect 
1,my opinion for the past year has been that the last film was destined to fail either way  tros is not necessarily a bad movie  it has great cinematography  good acting  some good concepts and ideas but the issue with it is the leading hands of the project either didn t know what to do or were scampering to fix the backlash to tlj i ve said the same about the sequels as i have about the other two trilogies   the middle act depends entirely on the third act for whether or not it works  tfa is fondly remembered even though it s very much a greatest hits case  but it s a good film that stands on it s own  honours the past and offers up the future  tpm fell in this regard because it was entirely standalone  as a prequel it had to work towards the established canon and build an entire world before that which still felt like the world we knew  it had no prior building blocks  except for things that were chronologically yet to happen  and it had to build up to the climax of the clone wars  it had a very vast head start  perhaps more than necessary  and between some bad decisions that felt off in universe and a lot of ground to cover where not much really happens  it fell flat the difference between the older trilogies and the new one was that the second acts fit in as pieces of the puzzle  even though empire was praised and aotc was not they both served the purpose of continuing the previous story and did them in fairly safe but pleasing ways  clones just did this to a lesser degree and left quite a sour taste because of the depiction of anakin  but then  those trilogies got a cohesive final act that pulled it all together  empire and aotc were both improved by rotj and rots  because they paid off a narrative clearly in the making  they tied things up and delivered powerful emotional payoffs for long built relationships and plot threads  tlj should have been the same  it s legacy depended entirely on episode 9  but from what we know i don t believe either film would have satisfied the same way the other trilogies did tros for example dropped the ball on all character relationships except for rey and ben  and partially rey and leia  and managed to reduce the rest of the cast to caricatures with dead end development  instead of properly resolving the existing plot threads  we got palpatine back  and not in a way that benefited the story as it could have if he had been a lingering warning of the dark side and a corrupting force  instead he was literally the villain and drove the plot  tros did not work in service of either of the prior films or offer satisfying conclusions to anything except ben solo s arc  and that retroactively left tlj to still be considered a failure where it could have been elevated to the most important piece of the puzzle neither dotf or tros seemed to serve the trilogy properly  at least in my view  they both has great ideas and bad ideas  you could take bits and pieces from both projects and make a satisfying movie  but instead we wound up with a just okay conclusion when we were promised a satisfying ending to the entire saga 
1,i never suggested it was groundbreaking  or that it had to be done  i m merely suggesting it s what the film says i have no idea what you re quibbling with since you seem to agree with me on that point 
1,well you ve been on the sub long enough to know the general complaints people have when it comes to tlj  i m not gonna waste my time explaining something you either already know  or just forget about whenever it suits you 
1, gt  but anakin s entire story in the original trilogy is that he s a fallen jedi who redeems himself by defeating the greater evil threatening the galaxy yep  knowing he becomes a murderous maniac didn t affect how i viewed or related to the actions of a 10 year old child  the actions of the 10 year old child did that 
1,well they were both created by george lucas so  most likely an easter egg
1,no the jedi are not a disturbance  the jedi use the force to protect all life  keeping it in its natural state   they do not use their powers for personal gain  they simply exist for the sole purpose of stopping any individual that would use the force for evil intent  they are the keepers of balance there is no such thing as a neutral jedi  to think so is to not understand how the darkside works  there will never be one force user who wields everything equal  as long as the force exists  there will be those who wield it for personal gain  those who would arm life for their own greed it s a cycle and it will never end  there are those who want to control the force for themselves and the force will do it s best to make sure someone stops them  chosen one prophecy so when there are no sith present  that s when the force is  balanced   without conflict  but such a state can never be permanent  for evil is always present in everyone s hearts 
1,when i first saw the film i didn t even realise what planets they were i just thought it was some random system they just didn t like
1,yeah  but he has main character plot armor 
1,my time travel machine has worked  i m reliving the aftermath of tlj s release 
1,i can t stand it  it all feels so fake  but that s just me 
1,do not defend palpatine  please  haha  it was out of left field  and i don t want to hear people who have bits and pieces from novels and stuff in a sad attempt to justify it  it was not decided on and wouldn t be until it was put in film  his inclusion is one of the worst aspects of by far the worst film of the sequels  there wasn t really balance  he s been alive and working in the shadows for apparently decades  snoke was controlled through him  there was no balance 
1,wedge is and i m not even joking in my top ten characters and he s barely had screen time  so if he dies i ll just be glad we got to see him again
1,yes  congratulations for reviewing the plot points of the film and telling me i ignored them
1,i d buy this if there weren t already so many other problems that persist throughout the st that suggest that even if they did have a plan  it was a shitty one   rey has no character arc  and really no character  she s good at everything and everyone loves her  she can already beat luke and kylo in hand to hand combat without needing to  balance  anything  if she is supposed to be a  gray jedi   jamming an arc into episode 9 wouldn t be enough to make anyone interested in her  that late in the game    tlj seems to forget about finn s origins  almost completely except for the fight with phasma  he has no issue killing stormtroopers and often provides comic relief while doing so  to have him then lead a bunch of rebel stormtroopers would be jarring  five minutes ago he was making jokes while he murdered their comrades   why would luke want to haunt kylo after having decided on a whim that kylo should be killed in cold blood  we know force ghosts can move things in the real world  yoda and the temple   so why not just turn on kylos lightsaber while it s on his belt  tlj botched luke so bad that even if they went ahead with duel of the fates  his character arc is a mess and i for one would not be interested in seeing it  i m glad jj largely left him dead    the location of the final battle and cartoon  videogame tie ins aren t story beats  they are merchandising and franchising opportunities  trevorrow has a spotty track record at best  i doubt he would have been able to save the sequels  but if this helps you sleep at night  so be it 
1,i think duel of the fates would have been better than what we got but it was still a pretty bad sounding movie 
1,do you mean the expanded works around it  cause if so  i d say that the mandalorian is much more closely tied to the sequels than either the ot or ptor do you mean the literal worlds themselves  because in that case  i d say that it s really only crait that feels empty  jakku and takodana are sparsely populated  but have clear systems of commerce and living that comes through  ach to is filled with creatures  and canto bight is a full out city  passana is another desert  but also heavily populated  as is kijimi  i don t really get what you mean either way tbh  but happy to discuss further
1,all of jj s stuff backs everything into a corner imo  lost  trek  star wars    he gets one exciting season film in and leaves a mess for the next guy 
1,they ll become the very thing they tried to destroy  the eu   ironic   
1,then that s fine   
1,you seem to believe that because rian johnson made a movie with a theme about  anyone can be force sensitive  it s not a bloodline thing  that it had to be done  that the theme needed to be thing it doesn t  a film maker is allowed to make mistakes  and forcing the redundant concept of  anyone can be force sensitive  was unnecessary  i ll agree with you and the film makers whole heartedly that broom boy represents the democratization of the force and that anybody can be force sensitive  but that wasn t anything new or ground breaking 
1,it s to create tension  plot  and growth for poe as a character  otherwise  poe wouldn t be an interesting character worth mention if he s the perfect leader and perfect soldier because that not how humans are  if poe was told the plan from the get go then the story would just be them waiting in a ship until it s time to run away on the cloaked transport  but that wouldn t have happened because the story would be different 
1, deleted 
1,same same  this thread is gold bc i m finding some similar star wars fans in here for once lol
1,he literally says otherwise 
1,a lot of his scores are very samey  kinda comes with the territory when you re known for doing one thing very well  same thing happened to hans zimmer after dark knight   
1,are we really supposed to gloss over the fact that you think tlj is amazing  sorry no can do  what the hell makes you think that dumpster fire of a film is watchable 
1,wow this actually could have been a good movie  sounds way better than homeless girl saves the galaxy and never struggles the entire time except that one time she dies but she gets brought back to life to save the galaxy from guy that was already dead 
1,yeah yeah but yoda exists   ahsoka exists   there are so many examples   every sw fan already knew before the st that you didn t have to be part of a special bloodline to be a powerful force user   it s absurd that people are still pretending it s some great revelation that rey was a  nobody  simply because they want to defend tlj   if you liked the movie  fine  but this argument is silly 
1,there have been tons of amazing sequels that were completely made from the ground up with no build up from the previous film  look at the dark knight  toy story 2  terminator 2  aliens  all amazing sequels that feel totally in tune with the originals all while creating fresh plotlines and continuing to develop main characters from the first films  these are professional writers  not high school drama departments  a lack of mystery boxes and cliffhangers isn t an excuse for writing a story that spits in the face of anakins entire arc  even though they kinda already did it with tfa but at least that movie was coherent 
1,not really 
1,yup  that s the other thing  far more of an emotional impact if  say  wedge antilles  hero of the rebellion  gets flat out assassinated early on  nuking unnamed planets with unnamed people worked in anh  because it was unprecedented  doing it again in tfa was    eh   and i quite liked tfa  actually in the middle of rewatch right now with the wife it s a very fun film with a lot of promise  despite its flaws  and it did a fantastic job of reintroducing old characters and introducing new ones i just wish the main plot points were better done 
1,it d be a bummer to see wedge die  but given the role of mentors in star wars it would seem likely  so long as it s done well  though  i d be perfectly fine with it 
1,i think the strongest element of last jedi was the idea that a anybody can become powerful in the force  i like that rey wasn t related to anyone  and that one of the canto bight slave children was force sensitive a close runner up was last jedi s theme of abandoning the rigidness of the old jedi and trying something new even though everyone hates last jedi  i wish i could have seen where those two themes led 
1,kylo ren and his story was single handedly the best part of the sequel trilogy  until they made him kiss rey lol  and it shows
1, gt that johnson ruined everything tfa set up  etc  however  none of those are the issue  i mean  i can t say it s johnson alone   but tlj absolutely destroyed my interest in any of this sequel  duel of the fates sounds pretty questionable too  i don t like ros either  but i had no expectations at all for that film  i felt like tlj pretty much destroyed any interesting direction the story could have gone 
1,  
1,yeah  i don t understand how their are just blanket complaints about any of those things 
1,you want to source that quote  because the first ever reference to a midi cholrian was the pm script in the mid 90s  before that  and as late as 1983  george lucas stated that learning to use the force was something literally anyone could do  comparing it to martial arts training in the book  the making of return of the jedi    gt revenge of the jedi story conference transcript  july 13 to july 17  1981 summaryparticipants  george lucas  richard marquand  lawrence kasdan  and howard kazanjianlocation  park way housenote  many of the ideas here are conceptual only and should not be considered canon in the star wars saga      the story of anakinlawrence kasadan  the force was available to anyone who could hook into it george lucas  yes  everyone can do it kasadan  not just the jedi lucas  it s just the jedi who take the time to do it marquand  they use it as a technique lucas  like yoga  if you want to take the time to do it  you can do it  but the ones that really want to do it are the ones who are into that kind of thing  also like karate 
1,what lucas does really well is world building  where each location feels very unique and interesting  the sequel trilogy worlds all felt like rehashed themes  the main characters felt like they were only there to fill character archetypes rather than to tell an interesting story  revenge of the sith felt cinematic and otherworldly to me   the sequel movies felt like a chore to watch with a few nostalgic moments to look forward to  i just wish more effort had gone into the scripts for the prequels  lucas should have deferred to others for that  lucas needed someone he trusted to tell him when something may not work  such as jar jar binks
1,lmao  there s no physics in star wars  it s not sci fi  and to focus on that misses the entire point of the movies how are they walking around without gravity how do light sabers works  kyber crystal  just say magic and stop why do fighters fly around space like its an aerial dogfight in atmosphere why have bombers  what causes the bombs to  drop  why not put hyper drives on torpedoes we got people moving objects with their minds single biome planets the very idea of a starkiller base is absurd  the energy from the star would destroy the weapon as well how does the hyperdrive even work anyways hand blaster making laser sounds  you ever heard a laser make a sound tyson once joked  the only thing star wars got scientifically accurate was the twins suns on tatooine  of course you didn t like the sequels  you watching for the wrong reasons 
1,eh  still don t think its as bad as tpm and aotc  those were entire movies of painful cringe that was hard to watch and still is  with 15 mins each of good content  at least tros had some cool parts throughout  leia s send off was done extremely well and hit hard  i def agree though  there were quite a few filming basics that seemed to have been forgotten lol
1,i m saying that you ve ignored all of the complaints about every one of these aspects of the film  if you actually need me to explain them then that just proves my point  but sure  stick to  muh people just had their headcanon ruined   it s better for you 
1,i dont think anyone at lucasfilm cares  they are generally fine with fan content so long as you dont make money with it
1, gt then  rian comes along and follows the logical story points set up in tfa  which means luke is an angry hermit  because why else would he be hiding and not leading  wat  that doesn t follow at all  there are an infinite number of perfectly good reasons luke was in hiding  we know that because in the year between tfa and tlj  star wars speculation was its own whole genre on youtube rian picked an answer  he didn t pick the only answer  and the backlash was huge because he intentionally picked a controversial answer  and he did this for basically every mystery box from tfa then ros walked back most of those instead of doubling down on that theme  so we got a spastic trilogy that has no cohesion
1,i m sorry that you think a trilogy where the major plot point to protect the bad guy s plan is clouding every jedi s judgement across the entire galaxy is better than the sequels  then i don t know what to tell you 
1,yeah everyone can have a opinion and everyone can tell you how dumb it is 
1,im all for it but i don t want wedge gone 
1,even if there wasn t a gaymance  a bromance would have been good  instead  there was just animosity between the two throughout the last film 
1,hey what happened to carl s voice 
1,yeah fuck death star mark iii  have a group just straight up suicide bomb the senate with leah being one of the few survivors and i ll have atleast some emotional impact  instead of 4 random planets i don t care about bite it
1,he could have gone faster  but he chose to fly through the energy beam  i don t know that it makes him dumb  he wasn t expecting somebody to come knock him off his trajectory 
1,put things together as much as you want  i love both the clone wars multimedia project stories and the clone wars so they are both the story to me  something with the prequel novelizations 
1,i just can t get over the loss of smaller detail that the clone wars had  that  amp  season 1 of rebels is garbage  just a personal opinion  it s much harder to get into rebels not really understanding the mess of each person s history etc  but i suppose that s part of the enjoyment  watching it unfold
1,i mean it would probably have gone through some more drafts
1, gt   and adored tlj don t kill me no need  you are already lost  no need to read further for me  we fundamentally disagree on what star wars is meant to be  if you haven t seen the mandalorian yet    don t bother  it is peak  ideal star wars  to me and as such i suspect you would hate it 
1,true  20 years long after episode 6 nothing happend  but in two days  episode 7   8       solo died     luke died     leia poppins died     almost     ackbar died     rey becomes a master jedi     snoke appeares and vanishes     kylo turns against his master after 2 days built up     the galactic senat is blown upits just ridiculous and shrinks the universe dramatically
1,we need more characters like barclay from star trek  he was weird  awkward  made mistakes  and was not very good at his job  he was meant to show that not everyone in star fleet was this perfect specimen of a person  which star wars leans on a bit too hard  where are the socially awkward jedi  where are the mediocre force users  they shouldn t all be gods 
1,  
1,well  this is kind of a bs argument  the reason poe  had  to say that was so that they holdo maneuver could be retconned away as something which we wouldn t see against    couldn t be used to swoop in and save the day basically  it s such bad writing which neglects everything we ve ever seen in star wars space battles that the next movie needed to pause to address it you could certainly frame it the way you do  to suggest that closing the loop on this makes for a consistent narrative in universe  from our perspective as consumers of a fictional story  however  we ve actually been taken out of the story a bit to have something explained away due to meta issues with the sequel trilogy and its narrative planning  or lack thereof  
1,i m pretty sure they ll remake the whole thing in 20 or 30 years
1,mostly because despite the flaws it nails it from an emotional aspect  you feel the tragedy of the fall of the republic  the fall of the jedi  anakin and obi wan becoming enemies  the culmination of three movies worth of planning and building and story and character arcs come together in a satisfying way  take note  jj and rian   on top of that it has some great special effects  especially the opening shots of the battle above coruscant  that blew me away far more than anything in the new films   an epic dual and palpatine s big reveal of his true self  it ended on the perfect  bittersweet note leading to the ot 
1,what are those complaints casino rose rey s story snokes death bombers how are these negatives exactly other than you said they are 
1,true but i meant finn and poe shouldve kissed
1,the shot at the end of tpm is explicit confirmation of it for the audience  and much of the drama in aotc is predicated on the audience knowing that palpatine is behind it all  and the characters not  dooku flat out reveals it  and the jedi reject the idea entirely because the story is ultimately a tragedy  i m rather hard on the prequels  but i do enjoy that element of the story the characters aren t made aware until rots  and i suppose if one didn t pick up on that  they wouldn t know until then  but it s never hidden in the prior films
1,if you want to deliberately misread tlj  be my guest  if you want to disagree with the creators of the film  similarly that doesn t leave us much room to continue this conversation  unfortunately 
1, gt there has been a lot of revisionist opinions about the prequel trilogyagreed  i think people forget how much the prequels truly destroyed star wars fandom  and also  how poorly received the clone wars movie was and the first few cw series  including the character of ahsoka  i think the ideas and themes of the prequels are great and all the supplemental material has definitely made them better  100   but if we re comparing the prequels vs  the sequels  strictly  as a three film trilogy  there s no contest in my opinion  the sequels are   you know   competently made however  i legitimately have no interest in comparing the two trilogies like that  i love the prequels unironically  i love the sequels unironically  the sequels just resonate a bit more with me personally 
1,i do agree with you  and my friends and i hate tlj  rose being the worst  but now i understand the real finale is much better that supposed to be  your research is not unwanted or unimportant  thank you for your post  as i understand that  pardon my french  disney fucked it up in tlj  and tros absolutely was an apology for tlj  good job sir or madam 
1,i ll never understand why they let this happen  star wars is one of  if not  the  biggest movie franchises in the world  and they don t even set any kind of basic plan up  all they had was their checklist to make audiences go  i remember that thing from that older movie  
1,honestly if i could get in a room with the execs  i d beg and plead with em to just give us good story lines that make sense  you ain t gotta get crazy  we re easy targets  we want to be swept up in a fun story  the fact that they re not delivering when they have such a wealth of material and talent to work with is really disheartening 
1,i ll take one  you mad bastard 
1,this  everyone blames tlj but the st was already ruined in the first 5 minutes of tfa  resetting and remaking the ot was an interesting direction  i hate that 
1, gt kylo ren becomes ben solo  happens off screen before the film starts  so no  gt rey becomes a jedi knight  not really  because she starts off insanely powerful and already able to beat the antagonist in the first film  we don t get to see growth or development  gt the empire rises and falls again again  the empire  rises  off screen before the film starts  we see the empire defeated at the end of vi and then vii the empire is at full force again  had we gotten a few seasons of  mandalorian  and a kylo film before the new trilogy  we could have actually seen the empire rise and kylo fall  but instead got a classic case of  tell  don t show  which is one of the worst things films can do 
1,ha  no worries  i m juggling a lot of conversations right now i m really surprised that people are unaware of the genetic component of the force and the long  long debates older star wars fans have had about heredity and whatnot just a shame that tros undercut tlj in so many ways   
1,  
1,i thought she did call herself a jedi  or at the very least  didn t correct anyone 
1, gt  you can disagree with me  but you re also disagreeing with the people who made the actual film yes and  gt  he s a literal slave and yet has special powers sounds like someone else i know  a nobody slave born to a slave on a backwater world far away from everything  luke was training a bunch of nobodies as well  before somebody ruined it 
1,time will tell
1,let the last jedi die  kill it if you have to 
1, gt  if we got the original episode 9  would the sequels have been better received or would it have been tlj 2 0 it would be tlj 2 0 times 100  if only for the first bullet point alone first jedi to truly embrace being  human   lacking a better term  how does it apply with non humans   is silly  because yoda already accomplished this when he faced his inner darkness during the clone wars  he prevailed by coming to the realization that his darkness exists  and by acknowledging and accepting that reality  allowed him to deny it power over him  that does not mean he now has the means to use the dark side for power the notion of rey struggling with the dark side was a great story  but this take on it would have been terrible  and therein lies one of my personal beefs with the sequel films  they had a great setup for two characters showcasing the struggle with the dark side from either side of the equation  and denied us a great chance to see rey nearly give in to the dark side  not because palpatine had her in a no win situation  but because she craved the power the dark side offered  without realizing she was about to rush head first into ruin  and only with the help of someone  kylo ren ben solo  who has lived on the dark side but ultimately found it lacking could she turn away from the brink of disaster oh  so much lost potential  i m imagining a rage fueled dark side rey fighting a centered and balanced ben solo  the things they could have done with that  could have anakin s blade bleed into a red saber during the fight  because ben would totally be using leia s saber   a sign that ben would pick up on that violence would not resolve anything  but the jedi way could  flash to the luke leia practice flashback  resolving the conflict doesn t come from the skill of the blade  but through compassion  have him drop leia s saber  taking a maiming blow  but embraces her  and tells her it s ok  she can let it all go now  she doesn t have to fight anymore i think of stuff like that all the time  and it makes me sad  ha 
1,yeah  consistency really shouldn t be much to ask for 
1,rebels is fucking great
1,lol  right i m in the wrong sub
1,same  i think he should ve gone in a  ronin in atonement  direction 
1,hey op  late to the thread as always but listen up  you re exactly right on everything  and now it s time you accepted the hardest truth about star wars fandom  this is a purely hollywood franchise  if it sells tickets or toys  it s part of the movie 
1,i m glad someone finally is talking bout the grysk  they are the big bad no one seems to be mentioning
1,i mean  if you want to ignore the central theme of tlj  sure  i guess then again  tros dispensed with the central theme of tlj  so might as well 
1,rogue one then 4  5  6
1,why do we have diesel gas electric vehicles 
1,it s a prophecy  one who will bring balance to the force  the jedi council believed anakin was the chosen one so that s why he was allowed to be trained so old  he was the chosen one as he brought balance to the force until disney shit on star wars with the sequels
1,almost everything people blame tlj for came from tfa  luke bailing on the galaxy  already established by tfa  it was just left to tlj to come up with a plausible reason why luke would leave everyone to suffer  empire vs  rebels 2 0  tfa is the one that killed off the entire new republic and established that a side faction of rebels were the only ones fighting back against the first order the only things it directly subverted were rey s parentage  which imo  making her not special was a  good  thing  and trying to make ben more sympathetic  also more interesting imo  
1, gt  enjoying the st while disliking all original star warsagain  that s a straw man  it applies to effectively no one  gt  liking the st better than all original star wars means you aren t a star wars fanwhy  if someone is a fan of the ot but happens to like the st better  then suddenly they re not a fan what if someone likes the pt better than the ot 
1, gt then all the tlj complains are  why didn t they do exactly what i wanted them to do with luke  so you ve ignored the complaints about the casino  rose  the pointless side quest  rey s story  snoke s crappy death  the bombers  the backwards holdo manoeuvre  holdo as a character  the horrendous speeder scene on crait  yoda as a force ghost  hyperspace tracking and the fact that the trilogy is pretty much done after two films  you ignored all of that and plenty more just to strengthen your own narrative that the only reason people don t like tlj is because their expectations are subverted you are something else  truly 
1,think it also would ve avoided that really  really awkward opening of luke flinging his lightsaber over his shoulder 
1,not having a clear vision  and not committing to a coherent story is kks failure  i was ready to forgive the horrific bits of all 3 if they had a unified story to tell  but it s just 3 drunken ramblings of stars wars fever dreams 
1,did you guys know that because of disney  there has technically only ever been one villain in star wars ever  somehow  palpatine returned 
1,hapan man toy
1,they also got a lot of legitimate death threats directed at everyone involved  i like to think that if those hadn t been a factor  they would ve been much more confident 
1,i d be down for the sequels to eventually be considered non canon 
1, gt  midi cholrians aren t a genetic thing  re read lucas  own quote  gt   the midichlorians are kind of a side issue  not in a sort of spiritual  metaphysical part of the force  but the more practical  biological  physical part of the force  or how we come to know the force  which has to do really with the   genetics   of why some people have more in tune to the force than others  they re literally a genetic thing  they are literally the genetic component of the force as stated by the guy who created them 
1,never noticed this  do you have an example 
1,that s called the new testament
1,my original goal was just trying to be nice and send an error  but that comment got me a little heated ngl
1,then they should have made a spin off movie on that subject instead of bastardizing the main trilogy and its characters  its at least nice to see that sequel defenders are honest about how they dont like genuine star wars though so thats why they like the idea of the sequels 
1,this is the most accurate comment about tlj that i ve ever read
1,you won t get a disagreement out of me on the she s got help bit in the final battle  it s a cool scene  but just really on the nose in terms of fan service 
1,the positive is that they could bring back some of these ideas again  a new trilogy where rey masters the dark and light side and we bring in a better cast including asohka and characters from thrawn  the grysks could be the main enemy and finn teaches reformed storm troopers to fight for the new new republic  keri russel could come back with her love interest poe but disney should show he face this time  it could even have an enders game style twist where the grysks are not just imperialistic monsters but they want peace  or they are are the mass effect reapers of the star wars universe selling this to the public will be easy if they throw in some mandolorians and possibly grogu if they are still alive 
1,tpm or aotc if you are an adult who can recognize noses and voices  somewhere during clone wars if you missed it in those  rots if you are really thick 
1,the only one she loves  
1,i didn t realise it was possible to have less respect for the creators looking at how amazing it could have been  and how simple it could have been to churn out something at least intelligible just shows the true incompetance of these people  couldn t do it without carrie fisher  sounds like corporate scum scapegoating the dead for their shitty movies  look at what they did to her final performance yet supposedly she could have saved their terrible writing 
1,maybe  the pt has weaknesses in writing and in directing  so novel vs movie wouldnt fix everythingthe big thing it needed was dissent  someone like gary kurtz or lawrence kasdan who had a strong personality to give harsh critiques to lucas s ideas  lucasfilm seemed very tech oriented at that time so most of the people were excited to be pushing the technology forward and were geniuses in those departments  i am not saying lucas surrounded himself with yes men so much as that the people he surrounded himself with were not expert story tellers as much as they were expert visual artists  computer engineers  etc
1,he went from guy shooting at wamprats to a pilot who could dogfight better than even the most veteran pilots and from dude who can t block a remote droid s lasers to cutting off the hand of the greatest jedi to ever live  a guy who killed one of the most skilled duellists in dooku again  quite a take 
1,you can say the same for broom boy
1,so if some fanfic comes out and retcons the  i am your father  scene in esb to instead make vader say  i am you  and turn out to be future luke  would that be canon because star wars is supposed to evolve past the ot  according to you 
1,the plot of the movie is great on paper but poor in execution 
1, i think it s crap  isn t a point  it s a whiny childish opinion without any qualification or explanation  i don t like potatoes   cool  go about your life then  i thought you had an actual point to talk about  but there s not much to be said about your vague and meritless opinion 
1,i wish they would redo the prequels and then redo the sequels
1,by literally the same people who talked about it at release   any new viewers of tlj or anyone who hasnt watched the endless bs youtube videos about rawwwwtljruinedmychildhood wont give 2 shits 
1,does she take the mantel  i dont think so  others call her a jedi but in old republic days people would call everything with a lightsaber a jedi if they didnt know about the sith 
1,i think there can exist a sense of awareness about both sides of the force without changing the major stuff  like that last sentence  yeah using the dark side always comes with a cost  those types of things don t have to be untrue for a newer order of jedi to have a better understanding of the force and it s facets  to help fight it  if nothing else  it s a mystical energy field  and it is always going to feel mystical  i don t think leading to a generation of jedi that understand the force better has to be about obtaining this mystical  grey state  that allows you to use both power sets or something  it s merely philosophical shifting  that doesn t change anything about the dynamics or events of the ot  really
1,i totally agree  say if the galaxy had a jump to a few years later  with luke training rey like yoda with luke but longer  than i would have liked it better  i remember reading that even the man himself  mark hamil wasn t happy with what they did with luke  because they told him to do things luke would never do  and he even told them that  he said he felt like he was like another skywalker   larry  or something i don t remember  because he didn t feel like luke
1,the newest trilogy felt pointless and forced  it made me laugh at times but there was nothing with actual depth because it was all copy and pasted 
1,because they don t feel grimy  lived in  and tangible like the original three movies do some of that is intentional  of course  but it was very jarring for those of us who grew up with the more grounded feeling space fantasy the phantom menace is maybe the best looking of the movies  with incredibly miniatures and great set design 
1, adored tlj  nothing to see here folks  this person is an idiot and they don t like star warsthat movie still sounds horrible and would not fix the issues with the sequels 
1,i may get crap for this  but aftermath  the entire trilogy  if possible  i would love to see those characters and eventually the battle if jakku on the big screen  reading that novel felt like i was reading a screenplay  it just feels made to be a movie 
1,post this to r prequelmemes the original draft actually sounds interesting af  and i m not big on the sequels
1,sorry i got a little lost in your guys back and forth  i loved tlj as well and loved that main theme  reminds me of ratatouille   not everyone can cook  but a cook can come from anyone  
1,interestingly i d argue endgame contains both  stepping away from the overall story fanservice there are two moments that embody good bad imo great  cap going back in time  it s  absolutely fan service   but we ve spent a decade watching cap wrestle with his past  the memories that are  painfully  recent for him  the dead love and lost life  him being sorely tempted when they get the stones is absolutely consistent with his character and the story and it s a functional  natural part of the story for him   knowing the  great evil  has been stopped and time travel is basically risk free   to take that option and go for that dance  it s fan service but doesn t  feel  like a forced  hey  listen  awful  girls assemble  it s the middle of a warzone where they ve  all been actively fighting  for a solid 15 minutes but are somehow all close enough and completely not engaged in combat to meet up with flawless timing  mantis is present despite being a completely non combative superhero  gamora doesn t know  any of these people  at this point  rescue removes her helmet purely for the face time  shuri apparently abandons her people and army to chip in  all of them literally just watched marvel  punch through a city sized spaceship  so have no reason to believe she needs their help  etc  it s fan service and done so badly you can  hear  the directors going  hey  listen  look how many strong women we have  
1,that is so awesome 
1,you d think they could muster the  bravery  to do it considering they made a billion  on both those movies 
1,well george lucas gave them a finished trilogy and they thought that fans wouldn t like it so they didn t use it 
1,if you have lucas statements that contradict the idea that force sensitivity has a genetic component  i m all ears however  this one goes all the way back to a 1977 interview with carol titelman  the force gives you the power to have extrasensory perception and to be able to see things and hear things  read minds and levitate things  it is said that certain creatures are born with a higher awareness of the force than humans  their brains are different  they have more midi chlorians in their cells   the making of star wars  by jw rinzlerseems pretty consistent to me 
1,he s flying into a beam of energy flowing in the opposite direction  even if he was going as fast as he could  the fact that rose could catch him means that he clearly wasn t moving at top speed 
1,i was thinking of doing the same thing to my room how did he do it 
1,it s a sad tragic story  i understand if some of the dialogue was not to your liking but you have to remember that everything that happend was to lure anakin to the dark side  and as far as the death of padme  science has concluded that people can die of a broken heart 
1,there were thousands of jedi born to nobodies and only three     jedi born to somebody in the movies   only 2 if you count pt and ot    the force never belonged to an elite bloodline 
1,it s not exactly an example of consistent storytelling  we cant pretend the ot had this consistent vision all the way through when stuff like luke and leia being siblings and vader being redeemed werent added until the last movie of the trilogy  this is the exact same stuff the st is being criticized for 
1, gt  falls in love with a guy who literally tortured her  held her captive  and killed his own father her friend in front of her in tfaeverybody s got their kinks 
1,anakin didn t get a love interest and a kiss through the ot though lolno one s complaining that kylo s family still loved him and tried to save him  which is what happened to anakin in rotj 
1,were you around when the prequels came out 
1,tlj fans think theyre big brain but they legitimately are just clueless on sw lore
1,  
1,i would have liked parts tfa but been disappointed by how close it stuck to the ot formula  i would have loved tlj  and i would have disliked tros 
1,it s the slide transitions that bother me 
1,john williams composes great main themes and they all sound very different  all the other more background stuff sounds very similar over all the scores he had composed  not bad just similar 
1,the star trek films weren t that good to begin with  the nostalgia wanking the sequel trilogy suffers from can be traced back to these films as well 
1,i mean  at least claire and owen have a history in jw  i would need to actually rewatch the movies to remember when rey and poe interacted for more than five seconds at a time 
1,you re missing the point of the post though  the op is making the argument that the hashing out did happen and that dotf was the result  before being swept aside
1,yeah  basically every non tlj complaint about new star wars has been familiarity  then all the tlj complains are  why didn t they do exactly what i wanted them to do with luke  
1,i mean in terms of actual force ability  in anh he uses the force to get the timing right on a torpedo shot and nothing more  which isn t odd for untrained force sensitives  in esb he fails to pull his fighter from the swamp  misinterprets visions  and only survives his duel with vader because vader wasn t trying to kill him  in rotj he shows significant improvement  but  since vader still isn t trying to kill him  his greatest force related stunt is still just the battle at the sarlacc pit  which is still pretty standard fare for a jedi knight  if anything  his advantage is that he s  smart  and plans well  not that he s powerful 
1,the sequels had so much potential  but it unfortunately ended up as a failure  and that moment when luke threw away his lightsaber and then drunk that green disguisting  milk  really killed it 
1,nah 
1,i do believe this will essentially be what we get and i m all for it  though i ll add that i also feel as if we ll see wedge as the mentor character and he ll end up making a sacrifice or something along those lines 
1,poe creating a mutiny was a really crappy thing to do  soldiers don t do that and it just made him look impulsive and petty  it felt like they were trying to make a statement about standing up against poor leadership but the purple haired leader who took over was making good decisions and you don t always tell everyone every little detail to a plan  especially when the enemy could have planted spies  it just fell flat as a concept  but that all happened after the leia in space which was also a ridiculous scene  once again  it s a shame 
1,i disagree or you wouldn t be cherry picking information that suits your argument  midi cholrians aren t a genetic thing  they are a bacteria that is drawn in higher numbers to people in tune with the force  they are present in everything  a higher count indicates a being is more likely to be stronger  but nothing more 
1,i don t know what s more amusing  that you called them or that there answer was that the show was crafted to not have errors  as if that s how errors work
1,i would have preferred kylo dying as a villain  but yeah  tor vallum is a very unique character  but i don t see his purpose here 
1,i d say it will be talked about for decades to come
1,we do know from rogue one that ships hyperspacing into ships causes destruction  but it seemed relative to size  but truthfully it doesnt matter  the ot and pt worked off the rule of cool when it came to space  my only issue with the holdo maneuver is that it should have somehow been set up in the first or second act rather than coming out of nowhere at the break into act 3 moment
1,i have had the great misfortune of watching book of henry  i remember leaving the theater full of despair that trevorrow was in charge of episode ix  at the time   perhaps kathleen kennedy had the same feeling 
1,i m not mad at you   
1,b r u h  i seriously don t understand how tf that got in the movie  for them to not even mention it then  like to just fuck over people watching the movie that way was so infuriating
1,this is one of the biggest problems  but i didn t realize it at the time  i assumed they would start episode 8 with that scene where rey hands luke the saber  he ll react  throwing it  sure  whatever  and then it would cut forward like 5 or more years  shows rey taking her training into her own hands  luke starts seeing that she s losing control and maybe comes out of hiding to teach her what it took him decades to figure out  that the jedi is bullshit and the sith are bullshit and she needs to learn to be better than both of them 
1,then you don t understand why fans don t like it if you think it s just because they  want something new but are scared 
1,coulda had a larger time jump and luke s and rey s story coulda been told through flashbacks as the main plot of 8 progresses  but that s not how star wars movies are generally set up so they probably didn t want to deviate 
1,i m kinda the opposite on this movie  i love every minute of the first half of the movie  i think it s some of the best star wars in existence  once anakin and obi wan go their separate ways the movie loses me 
1,dotf seems a like a wild fever dream  hux s death seems out of character as he seems like the type who d rather pretend to be good than die  and i love kylo s redemption  to me outside some core components like the ones u listed so i m happy they scrapped it but tros should be kept some of them like coruscant s return 
1,yeah   in a race against time before the weapon can fire he s going like 30 40  on the throttle 
1,thats a lot of words to say  disney had no vision 
1,oh right  okay that makes sense
1, thanks 
1,  
1,i mean  ask lucas  who knows  but if genetics play a part  they were force sensitives  most likely  or force sensitivity is somewhere close in their genes 
1,i think the reasons they dislike it are largely very silly
1,andrew winegarner is making a comic adaptation on his website   duel of the fates comic  the duel of the fates is an actual conclusion to the trilogy  and for a early draft  i think it is pretty solid  it s a shame that they didn t go with that version  maybe one day disney will release an official comic adaptation like what dark horse did with the star wars  george lucas  original star wars draft  
1,i d argue it s less evidence  and more just hoping people wouldnt notice
1,i thought op s point was that trevorrow s script would have  saved  the sequels  i do agree that abrams was responding to tlj but that has nothing to do with the duel of the fates script 
1,the killik trilogy from the expanded universe goes into a  no more light dark  view  before walking it back in the next book 
1,just because they had a prior treatment of the script doesn t really mean they had a plan  there is no arc  there was no plan  could the orginal 3rd movie script potentially had some cohesion to the trilogy  sure  but to say they had a plan is disingenuous at best 
1,re read lucas quotes  that  is what was established 20 years ago 
1,i agree with you  and i also liked the sequels  a lot    i m glad there s a silent minority that liked your post the problem is that many of us think that they never truly sat down and said  this happens in 7  this in 8  and we finish like this in 9   with an outline of each movie  they might have had an overall idea  but not enough to make it cohesive i also think they missed the opportunity of doing gl s scripts  say what you say  but he never gave you a similar sw movie  he s good at writing  but they should ve let others direct  i think it would ve worked better  my biggest thing is   the hate  yes  hate  that many have against the st  even more than the pt   were the movies good  heck no  but at least for me  they were extremely entertaining  and that for me makes this trilogy worth it  along with the great casting of the main characters 
1,completely agree  flip flopping directors killed the arc and made the whole palpatine2 thing really lame and a cop out  disney didn t have the balls to do the proper finale  so the whole sequel series is less than it could have been 
1,i liked the slow space chase  reminded me of wrath of kahan
1,dual of the fates  a summary  
1,vader slaughtered literal children and people were still fine with his son holding him as he passed 
1,that sounds better than what actually happened 
1,and  this video    from star wars theory going over the official concept art with some commentary 
1,somehow this brings back memories about mass effect   
1,don t get mad at me  get mad at lucas  i didn t make star wars 
1, small details such as reys parents      bro this has to be a joke
1,all star wars movies have had a bad sense of time and space  tlj was no worse at this than tfa or the prequels
1,i think you re absolutely right  at the end of tlj  after rey and kylo s confrontation  and the multiple stories about the failure of luke s academy  that there was meant to be some  middle  path  a sort peace with the force  rather than trying to control one side or the other and with rey being essentially a nobody  and the plot began by rose  this idea that the dark side was this bourgeois versus the light  which belongs to everyone would have been neat to explore  i m disappointed that they ditched these paths  it is the most cowardly stripping down of a story that i think i ve ever seen  instead of all of these ideas  they basically played super safe fetch quests  recycled a secondary villain  and copy pasted stuff from avengers without laying the groundwork 
1,doesn t jar jar visit a temple just like the one in  kotcs  in  the clone wars   i m pretty sure the temple is there  but i m not sure if the beings are that said  i think these are just easter eggs  and they are not really intended to link the franchises in canon 
1,a surprise  to be sure  but a welcome one  lol 
1,i have never cared for it  one of the most depressing sw films out there and it doesn t stand up because anakin s choice and padme s death just leave me scratching my head  the final duel is more spectacle than feeling like a fight   amp  x200b all i wanted after i walked out of watching that film was to watch a new hope and never watch rots again  i ll take attack of the clones over rots 
1,damn  crazy that balance exists within the force even without the jedi order s existence then 
1,it s more that he was always so constantly full of rage that he had the appearance of control  he never  lost his temper  because he deliberately kept himself too heated to have one 
1,we already sorta got that  who were kenobis parents  windu  yoda  qui gon 
1,literally because of that we had a cool character in snoke with a mysterious backstory  only for the next director to kill him for shock effect
1, gt 	i felt like such a clown when i left the theater lmaoso did all who lived to see such times 
1,pretty much  cut the saber toss  which pissed everyone off anyway  and have her tail him for a ridiculous amount of time  jake skywalker is depressing enough that i m willing to believe he let rey follow him for a year 
1,i am of the opinion that the original creator s intent is more correct than anybody else s 
1,honestly it is boring  the movies just slog on and have no real character development or interesting stories 
1,looks like tombery from ff8   where s the knife just kidding looks great
1,they had destroyed the shield generator though before hand so they were vulnerable
1,i think jenny nicholson said it best in her video on the leaked script  if one were forced to choose between the two finished scripts  tros is much more cohesive and complete  however  if one were choosing between the two as a starting point for future drafts  then the duel of fates has much stronger  more emotionally resonant ideas within it that tros  dof had better ideas  tros was a better script  essentially
1,and most importantly it would have had trevorrow making it  which was a huge thing people here didn t like at the time but have conveniently forgotten it every time this script comes up
1,i was thinking something similar  guess we were wrong about that 
1,  
1,where am i stating that i m upset i m presenting the theme of tlj  which i loved i m not sure where you re getting the impression i don t like something about it 
1,it wasn t  though  those cheap serials only inspired the imagery and tonality of the films  the story itself came from ancient mythology  or more directly  from joseph campbell s contemporary study of ancient mythology 
1,tlj was honestly complex and good enough that i m satisfied with the sequels completely regardless of tros not tying up loose endsit s a complex and bold take on sw that has never been attempted and a true piece of art   much like a well aged and properly decanted wine i m not surprised that it s lost on most  each rewatch reveals layers that an intertextual knowledge of hero myth making throughout various literatures and national sagas is required to truly experience at a deep level i don t blame a coarse populist like jj for bumbling a closing finale after rians beautiful minuet  i will treasure this film for the rest of my days and pray rians trilogy becomes a reality 
1,lucas has made many statements often contradictory  do you want to go off something he said in tpm comments  or later works 
1,not a popular opinion but after many iconic themes  the majority of john williams compositions are almost interchangeable now 
1,would love to see it  edit end of tfa to not include rey   chewie s journey to see luke  make a rogue one style movie to take place between 7 and 8 and show character development and provide some passage of time  start tlj where tfa ends 
1,yeah  it s a breath of fresh air 
1,the message not being in the movie was a big mistake imo   it could have made for a stellar opening to see like a battle between resistance and first order suddenly interrupted by the transmission   but the movie probably would have needed to be longer  which i wish it had been anyway 
1,if by now you mean the sequels then in some aspects it was better  in some scenes rey has a huge green border around her 
1,you re the typical tlj fanboy lol  i m so happy everyone else is calling you out for how pathetic your  arguments  are 
1,richard marquand directed vi  not jj 
1,i ve honestly prefer the idea of the duel of the fates since i heard about it  it s not perfect  and ben dying no matter what just bugs me because he didn t necessarily have to die like vader did after getting redeemed  but it s seems more coherent and interesting than what we got   it tied in to the prequels  clone wars series  and ot  tros has both the first order and the sith eternal  the  first order was supposed to be the military faction that rose from the empire  now they seem like a sideshow and that the sith eternal was the true intention  despite the fact that the first order was made because of the contingency plan   in dotf  it would ve been just the first order and kylo at the head  tros feels like kylo and palpatine trying to fight for the spotlight as main antagonist  overall  it just feels like a better alternative   but then again  i ve kind of wanted a ending where rey turns to the dark side while ben is redeemed and allows for another sequel trilogy so my tastes might not be that quality 
1,there s a difference between  boring  and  not a good story  if you re just not into that kind of story 
1,i am sorry if one small inconsistency ruins a movie or series for you 
1,well     fuck
1,not surprising  given how much crap williams went through when trying to score aotc  by reports  williams got frustrated because lucas kept changing the edit  making him need to back and rescore it  so  reusing tracks doesn t surprise me 
1,is it fair to say that the sith are a disturbance  and the jedi are not   having only jedi and no sith is no more balance than having all sith and no jedi  but to have no jedi  and no sith  leaving all the force in the life of one neutral being  would truly be balanced
1,first darth jar jar and now this  when will we learn that our actions have consequences 
1, deleted 
1,jj abrams can t launch a new storyline  he always needs to nostalgia wank and throw around some useless riddles before he can even produce even the most mediocre plot 
1,i think dotf is equally as bad as tros in concluding the skywalker saga  they both are problematic for the entire sw universe tros brought back palpatine and made the original trio s accomplishments worth nothing  it also undermines anakin s role in the entire story  the worst part about tros is that the state of the universe is the same as it was by the end of rotj  dotf has some very neat ideas such as having the climax at both coruscant and mortis plus having finn actually have a role in the story  what s kills the script for me personally is the ending to kylo s story  it s more depressing than tros   a rey and poe romance  incredibly random   and the inclusion of tor valum kylo s story is actually pretty cool in dotf because he s on a quest for power but the problem is that he stays evil for the entirety of dotf and dies evil  that s a depressing ending for the skywalker bloodline  rey and poe being a couple sounds like really bad and random writing  these two had no interactions at all in the first two movies and now are randomly a couple  the inclusion of a character like tor valum breaks the sw lore as it destroys the rule of two  his role is also strange because he s established as palpatine s or i think plagueis s master and has like 5 minutes of screentime where he teaches kylo to essentially be a force vampire and then kylo just kills him  i think it would have been better to have tor valum be the main antagonist and have him be one of the whills from one of george s original ideas for the trilogy where the whills were going to be revealed as parasitic beings  feeding off of the force  in the end both films are still an unsatisfying finale to the skywalker saga because all three movies didn t connect with one another and build off of what was previously established 
1,sure  both are flying saucers like we know from ufo sightings and 50s scifi the transdimensional beings from indiana jones also look like aliens fighting on the  great hyperspace war mural  in palpatines office  but both also look like 50s aliens or  grays 
1,  
1,yeah he should have been redeemed in the first 30 minutes  there were so many missed opportunities for reconciliation with luke  and the comedic potential of him having to go to the resistance and team up with finn to go rescue rey or something  why can t disney just give people a good time  tros was so depressing 
1,i don t think lucas should get the final word on everything star wars for the rest of eternity  if we refuse to adapt the series beyond lucas  vision  then star wars should ve ended in 2012  what s the point of making new star wars content if it s not allowed to depart from the vision of a man who had both great and horrible ideas for the series 
1,this is all well and good but it s also ignoring that during this time trevorrow made a movie so reviled and poorly reviewed  the book of henry  that there s no way that the powers in charge of lucasfilm could ve ignored that   in fact  it sure looks like the only thing he s done since that is a jurassic park short  
1,  
1,it s been a little bit since i ve seen tlj  so i might be wrong but isn t that pretty close to what happens rey extends saber at end of tfa  tlj opens with luke taking extended saber and tossing over his shoulder  first 15 20 minutes of film is rey following him around being weird  and their first intro is 20 minutes in 
1,man i ship stormpilot too but part of me can t blame disneylucas considering the insane shitstorm of vitriol they got just for putting a black man in tfa and an asian lady in tlj 
1,such a good argument 
1,are you really  that   from reality you don t know why people dislike tlj 
1,you should note that was just a draft  with some feedback  they could have brung out a much more fully fleshed movie that every sw fan would adore  or atleast the majority that would love it   the concept art alone makes me wish for this draft to be the the movie we got in december of 2019  first order occupied coruscant looks like something lucas would look at and say   yep  that looks like something i would do  and the beginning of the movie with rey slashing stormtroopers with a double bladed lightsaber like they re toys to get access to an eclipse star destroyer in luke s suit would ve been something every sw fan would have been amazed at ofcourse there were shortcomings  the rey and poe romance was shoehorned in  with them making out  twice  why couldn t they have rey and finn  that was very evident in tfa and boyega and ridley seem to be more relaxed together compared to ridley and driver  or they could have done a unique one with finn and poe  but conservative countries  you know    but oh well  they can t really do it now with boyega announcing he does not want to be involved in any disney star wars projects  and with carrie fisher actor for leia  s unfortunate death back in 2016  im hoping favreau and filoni  those 2 amazing men can save the sequels with the new tv shows showed at disney  s investor video  they seem to have a plan of making people appreciate the sequels more by adding in more context and lore  just like the clone wars and rebels did to make the prequel trilogy look much more amazing 
1,fricking auto correct
1,which is incredibly stupid because luke dying had absolutely no effect on the tlj story 
1,details he leaves out the shipyard at the beginning is specifically kuat the ship they steal wasn t just any star destroyer  it was  the eclipse  ssd completely with it s super laser and it becomes the new resistance flagship after lighting the temple beacon finn and rose are forced to flee into the lower levels of coruscant where they re saved by locals who have been fighting back  they also find groups of storm troopers have been defecting after hearing about how finn just left and was still accepted by those outside the orderthe final battle involves the resistance s limited fleet and  the eclipse  trying to break through the fo fleet  which includes a few new dreadnaught type ships  courscant is the fo capital in this btw   they re nearly overwhelmed since  the eclipse  can t use it s super laser without fear of missing and killing millions on the planet s surface on the ground finn gives a speech that rallies even more stormtroopers to their cause and he leads the locals and the stormtroopers  with a collection of modified fo and imperial vehicles  in an attack on the upper levels that secures a landing zone for the liberating resistance ground forcesthe main goal of attack coruscant was to destroy the first order citadel  a docked super ship that had served as their base over the decades and was also the source of the jamming tech they d been using to limit galactic communications  thus keeping the remaining republic forces and resistance from effectively coordinating and fighting back  the citadel ship can be seen in the background in the concept art of hux killing himself  mr sunday says it was windu s lightsaber  but iirc it was actually implied to be one of palpatine s blades from episode iii  that would ve been right after  the eclipse  landed the killing shot on the citadel and hux realized the battle was lost and he could either die on his terms or be captured and tried in courtthe ground team is attempting to upload a code that will cause the citadel to broadcast a specific signal  the eclipse  can lock onto so it can take it out without worrying about missing and leveling a swath of cityr2 is the one who is carrying this program but takes a shot in battle  handing it off to bb 8 to finish the mission  r2 lives  dont worry as the resistance fleet is being pushed back they do have a  help arrives  moment like in tros  but instead of a fleet of random bullshit  it s a new republic fleet answering the call to arms broadcast from the temple earlier on  i think they might also be under the command of a legacy character  but i m not surethe movie was to end with rey  still blind  starting her new order of force users
1,that s what happens when you make a sw trilogy with next to no world building 
1,this makes my heart hurt a bit at how good the latest trilogy could have been and what it ended up being    i didn t hate it  whatsoever  but the story could have been so much more cohese and epic
1,the maneuver alone didn t ruin tlj but it was a contributing factor  if i m just to limit my criticism to the  space fight  then i think the slow speed chase ruined the movie and all space battles more so than the holdo  who the hell turns on the tv to watch a slow speed car chase or a race between 2 turtles i could have ignored so much if only the movie was entertaining but it just wasn t 
1,this isn t about what i want  this is about what star wars is about 
1, gt  anakin was special  but luke never really did anything particularly impressive in the ot i have literally never seen this take before in all of my time in star wars fandom it is    unique it is quite the take 
1,doing so literal seconds before dying  after maiming rey  doesn t really count  his final act of good would ve been   just not killing rey 
1,i consider myself more than the casual star wars fan  i watch everything not just the movies  and i wish more than anything this is what they went with  damn it 
1,the prequels were nothing compared to this fiasco in terms of consistency to be honest  at least george lucas knew what he was doing with those three movies 
1,i ve never really understood this complaint about rots or the prequels in general  like to me  they look like something that was very well made in the 90s and 00s and is that the same as what a film in 2020 would look like  nope  but they still look great
1,please re read lucas  statements 
1,vader do not cut people to pieces  he force chokes them 
1,the whole movie is in cgi   fans don t like cgi since it looks so much different than the originals
1,the contradictions are minor at best and can be interpreted as the same story simply told a bit differently  for example the novel fleshes out a backstory for a particular character as it happened and in the show that character essentially gives an abridged version of that same story 
1,  
1,rumor has it  it was already in construction as they were to have multiple ones
1,yeah    because his redemption wouldn t have mattered if they bludgeoned you over the head with it before you knew anything about the universe  it would ve been terrible storytelling  just like the sequels 
1,first of all  they are old  and probably a bit out of training second  they have not seen each other for 20 years  they might want to find out how good their opponent really is third  obi wan is just doing it to create a distraction  more or less  that is why he only does what he have to do to keep the fight going fourth  as someone said it in one of the youtube comment sections   vader was being excessively cautious and timid in his offense  which is completely understandable  because who  wouldn t  be excessively cautious fighting the same guy who amputated three of your limbs and left you roasting alive the last time you saw him  
1,you can still argue against your first point  anakin was special  but luke never really did anything particularly impressive in the ot  i got the impression that luke was important more because he was one of only two people in the galaxy that vader might hesitate to kill  which actually wound up being the key to defeating palpatine  than because he had any special power 
1,that s not how production credits work  she still helped produce the show  you can t fault her for some things and then not give her credit for others 
1,i d like to preface this by saying i ve never bothered to watch the rise of skywalker but here s a quick synopsis of my issues with the trilogy but i ve already said them a million times  1st mistake rehashing episode 4 s plot in episode 7  same rebels vs empire completely diminishes the events of the ot and leaves us feeling like we ve already watched a better version of the film  should have explored the sequel trilogy as more of an adventure series exploring the history of jedi and sith with some geopolitical situation like the new republic trying to maintain peaceful order across the galaxy while respecting self determination of different cultures and planets because that s something we ve never seen  two i dislike shoe horned lines about sjw perspectives of life in a galaxy far far away  for example when finn grabs rey s hand and she yells at him several times  that was just embarrassing for everyone and pointless  at no point did luke grab leia s hand on the death star or anakin grab padme s hand on the battle of geonosis  it s stupid and adds nothing to the story and solves a problem that doesn t exist in this universe  thirdly what they did to luke is insulting  he was not the luke we saw in the ot and he distinctly existed to insult white males and belittle them imo  you ve already heard a million reasons why it doesn t make in universe sense for luke to be the way he was and there s a million alternatives so i ll leave it at that  fourth is obviously the mary sue argument  that nothing rey did was earned or relatable  she was just a superhero with no backstory and no character  anakin came from slavery and feared padme s death due to the trauma of his mother  he had quirks and pitifall s that led him to the dark side  luke similarly joined the rebellion after he lost everything with the death of his aunt and uncle  after his discovery of his father he battled within himself whether to succumb to the same temptations of his father  repeatedly struggling and failing in his training  none of this happens to rey  she s just the best always and forever and don t tell me kylo got shot by chewie s blaster or none of that nonsense  there s many ways that could have been handled better  fifth finn and poe are relegated to nothingness and i find their storylines  especially poe s extremely insulting to all males  poe being repeatedly belittled while receiving no input from his out of universe purple dyed superior seems to parallel with how i think kathleen kennedy runs the company and it s pathetic and insulting  sixth the whole sequence with yoda and luke burning the books or whatever feels like a cheap way of trying to explain away their destruction of the eu while trying to pretend like they weren t just trying to avoid paying royalties  it also doesn t fit the motivations of either character and i think it sets a horrible message to everyone  knowledge is always positive and worth looking into even if you ve found a better way of life it s important to understand our history and where we come from even in a fictional universe you think two of the most honourable and bright characters would understand the importance of historical works but i don t the disney s story group has ever flipped through a history textbook  seventh leia flying through space breaks several rules we understand about the force and is all the more ridiculous when the previous film literally had han make fun of outlandish uses of the force  eighth han and chewie going back to being smugglers is firstly ridiculous  a 70 year old living that life smh  secondly destroys the character development from the ot  thirdly it just feels like a squandered opportunity to double down on the message of hope that is pervasive in the ot  han and leia should have stayed together in spite of the conflict with their son cause that s the type of love and hope we finally established with vader saving luke in the ot and the type of precedence we discover in all their characters not just luke  i ve got a bunch of other minor issues but i ll leave it at that for now and conclude by saying to me it felt like tlj especially was written by someone who really hated star wars and everything it stood for  it was a complete slap in the face to sit through those films and all the more disheartening knowing it was the only chance to see our ot heroes on screen one last time  it hurts me on a deep level because of my upbringing with star wars and how the messages in those films shaped who i am today  the messages in the sequels terrify me thinking children might hold some of those concepts close to their heart because many of them are horrible ideals  the one positive thing i see people spout from the sequels is that lineage doesn t matter  but to me our hereditary relationships are a huge part of who we are but that doesn t mean they control your destiny  luke overcame the hereditary relationship with his father so why does that need to be disrespected to push this anyone can be great narrative  we already new anyone could be great cause luke came from nothing  han was a smuggler  leia was a princess but they all built who they were through their own efforts  the sequels is just rey doing everything and poe and finn are there to dismantle the patriarchy by belittling men on screen  that s the message i get from the films and i m at a loss to what their existence on screen means besides that  i m really disgusted and disappointed by the sequels and i refuse to acknowledge them as part of the star wars universe and i hope whoever was in charge of them is let go and moved on from  the mandalorian is a step in the right direction but i have a few complaints about that one too  but it s not nearly the horrendous rubbish that was the sequels 
1,  
1,same for me  i tried to rewatch it three times since i originally saw it in the theater  because i thought i might have been too negative since the out of place humor really through me off but i just couldn t finish it once  i really think it s a bad movie  even though it showed a bit of potential 
1,unless they can retcon the ending so it turns out that rey visited luke years or months later 
1,some things like the dark saber would have been too much  but overall i completely agree  the lack of direction will never cease to amaze me  it should have been one planned director from the beginning  the lack of a shared vision is apparent  even to a more general fan 
1,i think they could have kept the empire as a scary force if they did it correctly  the rebellion was always a small force  and definitely not strong or large enough to control the  new republic  it would have been interesting to have a warring states period with the empire lurking in the shadows  maybe the empire uses it s remaining resources to destabilize the new republic rather than outright conquering it 
1,release order    someone not giving a film a chance because it s  old  is ridiculous to me
1,the recent vader comics are great and so are most of the clone wars ones
1,since it s  one in a million  it isn t used much  and since it s in the movie  this made up universe we are entertaining ourselves with   then it s obviously possible  you can argue against it all you want  and you may not like that it s there  but it is 
1,everything about that sounds better than what we got   full disclosure  i m a tlj hater  it s a fine movie  but a terrible star wars movie imo the storyline sounds like it could be coherent and the it actually fits the metaplot  sad day 
1,hahahahaha  forgot about that classic
1,oh    never occurred to me that the name was a combo  now it seems weird to me too 
1,it s bizarre how you guys cling to him grunting as being his last words and completely ignore the final exchange he had with han   those  were his last words  and they were perfect 
1,he d just as soon kiss a wookie 
1,if an alien landed today and watched then in order my wager is they d said rots if you asked them 
1,it was honestly great  and snoke s whole double meaning speech was amazing 
1,space walrus milking luke too 
1,  
1,agreed  there really isn t any way of salvaging it  from what i can tell the people that liked tlj generally dislike tros  and vice versa  or  like some of us  just hate the whole bunch  it has a mixed to negative reception  props to those who can somehow enjoy all three  but that doesn t change the fact that the trilogy was poorly put together  why constrain future storytelling to that incoherent mess disney have shown with the recent investor day that the st is radioactive ground  hence the lack of properties connected to it   give it time  doesn t really apply either  i think they should go a step further and branch away from it entirely 
1,high end courier
1,looking back at what tros did to finn  they should have let him go through with his sacrifice in tlj 
1,i don t think it s as good as what they have now but it definitely still holds up  no doubt 
1,there virtually invulnerable and live for hundreds of years
1,hey i ve got this one   
1,  
1,i hope they do a snyder cut esc thing   release the original planned product 
1,  
1,rose takes over the rebellion after leia is gone 
1, gt  everyone complains that rian johnson threw out j j  s planthat people think abrams even had a plan is perplexing to me  his entire career was built on  not  having a plan  not having an ending  and letting other people come up with answers to his mystery boxes while he goes off and writes the opening paragraph to his next aimless idea 
1,it looks like shit
1,exactly  it s like people just neglect to acknowledge certain things for the sake of their arguments so that they can continue to talk bad about the sequels  you don t like them  fine  but if your going to try to explain why you don t like something at least use all the facts and maybe fully understand the films before you do so 
1,leia was definitely misused as a character  alot of that is probably due to the untimely passing of carrie  fisher of course but i feel like if they were keeping the character anyway we should of at least seen her in a lightsaber battle it s sort of just thrown away like  oh and btw leia learned the ways of the jedi as well  here ya go fans see it happened like you wanted  and then never really used as a real plot device i am one of the few who actually liked luke s arc in the sequels  if you can really call one movie an arc  he was the ben kenobi of this trilogy  the wisened old veteran who helps the hero and sacrifices himself to save the others  only difference is he had to have a change of heart to make him do it where as ben was still following the jedi way even after his former padawan had betrayed him i think alot of people missed  or just didn t care  about the way that luke and obi wan ended up having a very similar story  it s just that all of the cool stuff luke did for the jedi before being betrayed happened off screen  in my mind this was a really cool call back and tie together of the original and sequel trilogy which i quite enjoyed 
1,that s because it s a saga about the skywalker s  if you want to move away from that just start a new saga  pick up the story of ezra 
1, gt now s the part where you insist that they re only periphery characters and aren t actually evidence to my point no  actually i just don t think you know what a bloodline is  the 2 examples you ve given here are siblings and cousins  that s not a bloodline  that s one generation  a bloodline would be formed if the people in question then went on to have kids  and a force sensitive bloodline would be formed if they were    force sensitive  gt we could ask george lucas  what he thinks    gt    gt  the midichlorians are kind of a side issue  not in a sort of spiritual  metaphysical part of the force  but the more practical  biological  physical part of the force  or how we come to know the force  which has to do really with the   genetics of why some people have more in tune to the force than others    yeah  you really don t know what you re even quoting  george in this quote is talking about genetics  not bloodlines  gt please tell me again how it s batshit crazy to suggest that perhaps    perhaps    genetics may play a part in being force sensitive genetics were never in doubt  that s what the midichlorians are all about  what we re talking about however are these apparently abundant force sensitive bloodlines you insist exist in the star wars universe 
1,dropping lore in a legit star wars game  nah dropping lore in a popular game that star wars fans shouldn t have to play  alright 
1,i wish duel of the fates had become an actual thing
1,not to mention 1 2 of them trying to ensalve the galaxy 
1,this would have been quite a bit better actually  but the sequels also have a problem with choreography  like  rey s lightsaber skills are complete shit and somehow shes able to beat everybody even though shes swinging a weightless blade around like a baseball bat in a completely unstable stance  also  her lack of training before being able to do a jedi mind trick and somehow being able to lift more and bigger objects than yoda and with less effort  i kinda wish they used george lucas  original idea for the sequels with darth talon and just fleshed it out a bit 
1,lol bye weirdo
1,  
1,nah  he s some stc moron who couldn t appreciate a nuanced opinion if it jumped up and bit him  same as you  apparently 
1,i mean    throne room fight  rey and kylo s interactions  porgs  just porgs   the holdo maneuver  no matter your feelings looked amazing  and made decent enough sense in universe  plus having enough qualifiers to make it unrepeatable    showing the more nuanced sides of war  i honestly enjoyed the comedy aspects  no clue why you felt every single one was bad   the entire movie was visually stunning  it has the best effects and design of any star wars movie   the dialogue was    fine  there s definitely a few cringy lines  but on the whole  the sequels were generally way better about having dialogue sound like people   luke s arc was amazing  he gave into the flaws he had in the ot  impulsiveness  anger  etc   but overcame them  as fallen order said  a jedi can never truly overcome the dark side  but what makes them a jedi is keeping up that fight 
1,i m saving this post to read later when i feel sad about the st
1,sounds formulaic but enjoyable
1,the moment when kylo kills snoke and him and rey fight back to back is  and i will stand by this  the greatest moment in all of star wars 
1,goodbye 
1,the problem is also the reception of the fans  after tlj  disney was done taking risks  and dotf would have been one compared to the fan service tros
1,  
1,would have been nice to have something different than the usual stuff  they had the potential to try something new since people would have watched it anyways with the og trio in their cast  yet they made nothing but a generic cashgrab that i wouldn t even call a trilogy  you can clearly see that nothing was planned at all from movie to movie  jj and rian johnson clearly didn t communicate at all  really sad since i had such high hopes but i probably will never watch any of these 3 movies again in my life unless i m drunk and want to make fun of them lol 
1,no there s nothing that says explicitly it s a lie  though id venture to say that kenobi s galactic sized eyeroll when han starts his sales talk comes pretty close  as does the fact that he s talking nonsense  using a measure of distance as a measure of time  but it s something that fits his character as a fast talking  charming hustler and   acksually  there was a kessel run  and here it is in boring detail   kinda ruins that 
1,the real problem with the sequels was that they did not actually need to exist  there was no real room for a sequel trilogy after the previous two closed the skywalker story  and if they really wanted to do a follow up  there were some amazing stories in the old eu they could have drawn from  basically exactly what the mandalorian is now doing  but they chose to say  fuck it  and made three films that  while moderately ok on their own  make for an incoherent clusterfuck of a trilogy when taken together
1,the thing is  i don t doubt jj s passion for star wars  at least for the ot  it s all to do with contracts and credits and such  same as any other blockbuster  if star wars wasn t something special that had existed outside that hollywood structure for so long  it wouldn t seem all that strange to us fans that was the biggest misstep  imo   gt  treating this ip like any other when it was literally built outside the studio system   there s some good history in the friendship between lucas and francis ford coppola  and their shared hatred of the studio system   flaws and all  star wars had always been a passion project  with the buy out  suddenly it wasn t about creative vision but balancing contracts and budgets and box office expectations   
1,you said you like tlj so i stopped reading
1,yeah the soundtrack is great  hope they find more places to use it 
1,i ve said it once and i ll say it again  any problem with tlj or ros is because of force awakens  force awakens is a loud  pretty  feel good mess
1,but anakin s entire story in the original trilogy is that he s a fallen jedi who redeems himself by defeating the greater evil threatening the galaxy and everything in the prequel trilogy serves to set up and illustrate that same fall and plant that seed for redemption by design his movies  stories are tied to the end result 
1,personally i think the actors did a phenomenal job with the script they were driven  i guess you can put this down to being a kids film but it was a bit off putting for me when there were fleets of rebels being killed and rey poe rose joking around 
1,i honestly hate the idea of post apocalyptic coruscant  it s not needed and really just unsatisfying as a fan 
1,rey having the light and dark side made sense  while growing up  she should have tapped the dark side to survive  the last three movies should have been an internal struggle as much as an external one  and the  first order  was just silly  better a fragmented galaxy or the rebellion being subverted from within 
1,the last jedi is my favorite star wars film  i know that is a very controversial take but   i liked that they made rey a random nobody    i liked that the heroes all failed but learned something from it  they weren t all just the badasses that could do no wrong   they gave kylo ren some depth and got him away from being a vader clone   old man luke s motivations made sense after what was set forth in force awakens   it didn t rely on nostalgia or the old cast  really focused on the new cast i think in time  tlj will have a much better fairing with people 
1, deleted 
1,yeah  same 
1,if you didn t see the immediate problems with the horror story that is tfa i don t even know what to tell you  the movie is terrible and bland on a scene by scene basis  how the hell did you make it 9 hours before you realized that the trilogy was shit 
1,it is funny how it happened not only to anakin with ahsoka but to obi wan with anakin 
1,it never was the case that you had to have a specific bloodline to learn the force  this is one of the more frustrating things about the st that is repeated a lot the star wars saga was a story of a specific bloodline of force users  it was literally about the skywalker s  luke  and his father  for me the most sensical sequel would have been luke s child or leia  the star wars universe already had very much established anyone could be born force sensitive  without making a mockery of the training required to be force sensitive  a saga movie wasn t the right place to ham fist a plot about the skywalker s not being special 
1,going off of that metric  ben solo did more in his final moment than anakin did  he killed all knights of ren  helped rey prevent the resurrection of the emperor  and gave his life to save rey  all anakin did was yeet someone 
1,i d abandon leia and the new republic for baby yoda too   s
1,you have to admit those are better than    palpatine coming back in a clone body  ik that s how it is in legends but i don t like it in either form because it makes vader s redemption seem less meaningful    the fleet of star destroyers who have death star equivalent weapons but have no shields in atmosphere or a way to leave exegol without a lead ship   all of the jedi who shouldn t be force ghosts voices  luminara unduli  mace windu  kanan jarrus  etc      rey being a palpatine   finn getting a 3rd love interest  some hint at force abilities  and basically nothing else   rey claiming the skywalker namei could go on 
1,yeah my only problem with ahsoka vs  maul was u knew both survived but the choreography was great
1,and everywhere you look she s listed third  if all the credit isn t given to favreau and filoni   given that s not by mistake
1,well done  whoever you are  this is what this sub should be about  discussing star wars   not mourning or blindly lionising it 
1,oh yeah dude ever since i read duel of fates i ve despised rise of sky walker  such a shame
1,he could use a good kiss 
1,there are other alternatives though maybe rey has been working with the caretakers and hasn t seen luke since that moment in tfa maybe she s stayed on the island  unable to talk to him since that day she arrived on the island in both cases she d have a proper introduction to him about 20 mins into the film or something i honestly think they could have easily written a reason as to why there s a gap in time and still have the proper introduction needed 
1,  
1,i agree  rebels is amazing  personally my favorite sw media
1,who s character was developed   not attacking you  it just seems like most people  myself included  came out of the theater feeling like what characters weren t outright assassinated  luke  leia   were largely the same as they were in tfa   rey  finn  and poe ended the same as they started the movie basically   kylo    stopped trying to be vader  i guess   but then went right back to it the next movie so   
1,you can easily cold form your own metal helmets  but i feel like padding is required and a mini fan installed too  filters are suggested so you can breath easy knowing you won t get sick at those conventions 
1,and the pt is just the bad guy using magic to  cloud  the other magic people s abilities 
1,empire at war  swtor  kotor 1 2 modded
1,  
1,i think mandalorian is so successful in part because it s giving us a taste of how hard it is for the new republic to keep order while preserving freedom too     without the senate ridiculousness that plagued the prequels
1,  
1,i didn t much care for season 1  but there are some episodes in the series that stand out as must see for any star wars fan
1,yep  flying princess leia contributed too
1,i knew it would be bad the second jj was announced to return  his films are very flashy but and he can do ok dialogue and character interactions but when it comes to plot and world building  it s all shallow and bad  it sort of worked for star trek  but not into darkness  and in my opinion started to fall apart maybe halfway through tfa 
1, gt  luke abandoned everyonei feel like this one was actually the hardest to come back from in tlj  people complain about luke  trying to murder   not even really  ben in the flashback  but what other possible reason besides a colossal personal failure could there be for luke f ing skywalker to abandon his sister and the new republic 
1,  
1,it is a shame the series never leads to the obvious  not having attachments makes you weaker  not stronger 
1,i actually am in favor of kylo dying evil  that would explain why when luke looked into him all he saw was darkness 
1,i know  i watched the throne room fight in theaters  and it was one of my favorite star wars scenes  maybe even the best duel besides maul vs obi and qui gon  anakin vs obi wan is great  but a little long imo  still my  3   no shit the choreography is gonna be unrealistic  it s star wars  as for the guards waiting to attack  that s literally a common trope from the same samurai movies lucas based star wars on 
1,  
1,this  a character trying to actively use both sides of the force also sounds like more of a setup for a new villain than the new way forward for the jedi as you said  the jedi should be more about mindfulness  accepting that they have negative emotions and traits but not acting on them or letting them drive them 
1,we can just move this right over here
1,i appreciate your post  thanks for sharing 
1,no  balance is stopping the sith from abusing the force 
1,  
1,just to be clear  you re upset with the movie theme that anyone can become great  and you think it resulted in a bad movie 
1,if anything  8 made him out to be  less  evil than 7  after seeing him slaughter han solo  i wanted to see rey draw  amp  quarter the fucker  but at the end of 8  i came to understand he was a heavily traumatized person that wasn t as clear cut as any of the prior villains  there s enough light in him to know he s gotta kill snoke  but too much dark in him to join the fight against the first order 
1, gt  i think the larger part is that a lot of people put a large amount of stock in end results destinations  exactly  i didn t feel like knowing how anakin s story would conclude affected how i judged the movies about anakin 
1,you know for me it s hard to imagine a worse conclusion to the trilogy than tros  but it seems that disney has a problem with being pressured by fans to do dumb shit 
1,speak for yourself  i despise the sequels as they are and i think dotf is only  marginally  better  it s still a freaking mess and i m not sure how much a second  third or fourth draft would improve it 
1,i mean  the ot is just rebellion against the evil empire  and the st is a copy of that so   
1,you pretty much just described my problems with mandalorian season 2    sub luke in for yoda
1,nah he isn t  he just thinks the last jedi wrecked the rules and that is fine  because it did
1,there was still an entire sith  planet  that nobody knew about in tros 
1,it had no direction bc rian johnson couldnt advance the story points introduced in tfa and then jj had to walk it all back  kathleen kennedy should ve had a plan for where the saga was going for 7 9  at the end of 9 we were in the same spot as we were at the end of 6  arguably in a worse spot given the damage done to luke skywalker 
1,star wars  endgame would ve been even more like marvel  yay 
1,it s amazing how you guys have nothing new  just the same tired takes about  previous canon  you didn t like the movie because luke skywalker didn t have his hallway vader moment  and it wasn t what you were hoping for stop making every plot detail an indictment when it s no less realistic than previous works
1,and this is why i always say aotc is the worst star wars movie  lucas literally fan serviced it out and played it safe after tpm backlash  you all like boba fett  well here s jango fett want some action with lightsabers  here s a field of jedi just messing stuff up hey  want to see something really cool  look  yoda s a super bad ass 
1,i wish we got to see a little bit more of the the new republic core worlds before they were destroyed  like  i feel like they didn t really set the stage for what the new republic resistance first order all were and what role they played in the conflict and therefore we don t really understand the loss  i think in time that will be corrected as we get more content in the time between episodes 6 and 7  but for now it s a little hallow
1,  
1, gt after a season and half without seeing one this is darksaber erasure
1,thanks for the response  i feel like it would confuse the audience more  everything that we know about luke in this moment is that everything that he worked for was destroyed and he felt so strongly about his failure that he needed to go into exile  if we accept the narrative of luke that we re presented in tfa  it wouldn t make any sense for him to suddenly change his mind just because some random girl showed up on his doorstep with a lightsaber  rey meeting luke for the first time has some of the greatest potential for a scene out of the entire sequels  most fans weren t thrilled with how the interaction went  there were lots of ways that conversation could ve gone that would ve been more reverent to the character as we understood him in the ot and called back to yoda s first meeting with luke in esb  however  to hand wave that meeting away with some sort of  wow it s been fun training for the last year  would be perhaps an even greater disservice to the fans than the conversation we ended up getting 
1,the sequel trilogy makes me wish i was dead   
1,the random addition of palpatine is what pissed me off  and then reading the words before the movie and it just saying like  a message from emperor palpatine has been sent out into the galaxy  and i was like wtf is this  however the 3rd movie is the best of the sequels in my opinion   although they suck compared to prequels and og trilogy 
1,sounds like selfishness  arrogance  and egotism run amok then 
1, gt and are you seriously suggesting disney didn t give a shit about a multibillion dollar franchise film no   i don t know why you seem to be intentionally misreading me   i m saying they could care less about whether the themes of the new movies line up with subtle points about the previous canon  as long as these themes have broad appeal   clearly  the part about mass appeal means they care  about a multibillion dollar franchise film   duh   but my point is they only care in so far as it can make them money   gt if disney didn t give a shit  why d they completely throw it all out with tros  i don t understand what you re trying to say here   the fact that they didn t continue to emphasize this theme just reinforces my point   they don t care about thematic continuity or integrity   they care about selling tickets and merch   the reaction to episode 8 scared them   even though they sold a bunch of tickets  the reaction was mixed  and solo failed to impress at the box office afterwards  so they returned to what they thought was safe  gt as for lucas  stuff    again  this has been around for decades now and been discussed ad nauseum by me and other star wars nerds for a loooong time i mean screw me for only considering what is actually in the movies lol   if force use is primarily genetic  the jedi have come up with a great way to eliminate strong force users from the galaxy since they don t reproduce 
1,the first two are just fine  they have some silly moments at worst and at best dabble with some interesting topics  but holy fucking hell 9 is the absolute worst sw movie ever made and that s honestly impressive  main reason is that its just not filmed well  there s plenty of spectacle but the actual cinematography is awful  nothing is framed right and worst of all scene transitions cuts are abrupt and frequently lacking continuity  scene cuts with rey holding a lit lightsaber and running forward only for a split second later where shes stopped and her blade is unlit   its the little things like that that 100  destroy  9 for me  i can stomach the mcguffins and deus ex machina that s annoyingly prevalent in he movie and i can even handle the nonsense plot but i cannot handle a movie that makes my head spin every second that goes by due to poor directing and cinematography 
1,dotf ruined luke  too  the idea that  after his arc in tlj  luke would just give up on ben and tell rey that she has to kill him is ludicrous 
1,palpatine would have been replaced with pennywise obviously 
1,i ll have you know vader lived to a ripe old age and succeeded in destroying an ancient warrior monk institution  as well as setting up a new galactic empire  then over throwing that empire  he was a role model if you ask me  ha 
1,i never said that there weren t legitimate reasons to hate tlj  but too many fans confuse bad screenwriting with personal letdown  okay  let s use an example i hear way too often  luke skywalker  the fact that his failure left him jaded and cynical does not make for bad writing or storytelling  it s a sad fate  but it s not his final fate  nor is it a betrayal of the fans  it s not the creative team s fault if the fans expected him to be one way and it didn t live up to their expectations  luke s story is a story of temporary failure  rekindled hope  and eventual and ultimate victory 
1,fans wanna be invested in a villain   not just have someone lazily slap together a new villain   no one s invested to any of the sequel characters which is it s biggest problem and your talking about just making a new villain  why would we care
1,holy fuck  let me explain this to you as simply as possible fuck anakin  his name could be billy the motherfucking hobo ffs  what you said was  bringing  balance to the force  means eliminating the sith   this is not true  both the sith and jedi needed to be eliminated in order for true balance to exist  just use your fucking brain for a second  the dark and light sides of the force are literally yin and yang  everyone knows this  but there cannot be balance without both  you can take yin  the darkness  chaos  etc  and leave yang  light  order  etc  but that does not bring balance there is only light and light cannot exist without darkness and vise versa  as i said multiple times  the sequel trilogy retconned anakin bringing balance to the force but even the sequel trilogy proves my point as what it retconned was anakin being the chosen one and killing palpatine  etc  but even at the end of episode 9 when rey brings balance to the force does the jedi order still exist but they simply just got rid of the sith  no    both the sith and jedi orders no longer exist and this is what brings balance to the force 
1,i m not going to pretend like the superman maneuver was a great scene  but to just kill her off there and cut the rest would mean erasing the majority of carrie fischer s final performance  i understand why it wasn t done 
1,this is my personal theory based on the lore i ve absorbed over the years the force has no  dark  or  light  side  the force just is  it s a universal constant  like gravity   it binds us and penetrates us   it s a basic building block of life  attributing good or evil to a basic building block of life is like trying to say the earth has the  good kind  of gravity  but black holes are pure evil  good and evil is a measure of intent  this isn t the d amp d universe  forces of nature aren t inherently good or evil i believe that the force works as an amplifier of sorts  it increase inherent abilities and allows living beings to do things beyond the scope of what their bodies would normally be able  some force users have different latent abilities  which is why some are more skilled in certain areas than others  and why select few have specific unique abilities that can t be replicated by others as an extension of this  the force amplifies the emotions of the user  anger is amplified into rage  love is amplified into obsession  anxiety is amplified into fear  confidence is amplified into pride  we see this time and time again with both sith and jedi who are lax in their restraint  their flaws become exaggerated over time and they  fall to the dark side   which is to say that they allow the force to stoke the worst part of themselves this doesn t even fly in the face of the ideas laid out by the movies or the ot  if you notice  the jedi don t ever encourage perceived  positive  emotions like love and joy  they encourage  detachment   they teach their padawans from a very young age to cut themselves off from emotion altogether  contrary to the sith who stoke their emotions by delving deep into the force  the jedi are taught to avoid emotions altogether and only touch the surface of what the force can truly do  yes  jedi believe in a light and dark side  but all that means is that the pragmatic knowledge of how the force works has been couched in mysticism and the personification of human intent in a universal constant that has no ability to actually show conscious intent  this is absolutely normal for how religions and dogma form naturally over time  much like ancient earth civilizations attributing supernatural forces to the sun moving in the sky or the changing of the weather 
1,so   why tf did finn and rose kiss exactly  it seemed totally pointless  and it was never spoken of ever again 
1,and i think the prequels were worse 
1,to use an example from another popular disney franchise  endgame is a good example of good fan service  traveling back to events scene in previous movies and making brief references to more  yes  it s fan service  but it works well within the movie 
1,ok  if you re saying anyone can be  special  or  force sensitive    and that needed to be established by rian  then there is nothing left to say  that was already established 20 years ago 
1,that is my point  it s boring  why don t you grow up 
1, gt  if you only like the part of the ip that most of the original fans don t like you re not really a fan of the ip ah  and the gate keeping only deepens  two things 1   i don t know if there s a single person on the planet who  only  likes the sequels and doesn t also enjoy the ot  pt  or some other part of the franchise  there might be a few out there  but it s a group so infinitesimally small that it s not even worth mentioning 2   how do you define someone who s  really a fan of  star wars  do they have to like all 11 movies  do they have to like the ot the best  do they simply have to like a  majority  of the movies  can they like anything they want as long as they  at least  like the ot let s say  hypothetically  that someone liked the pt  the st  and solo  but they don t care for the ot and rogue one  that means they like 7 of the 11   or 63    of the movies  that certainly seems like someone who can call themselves a star wars fan to me or what if they only like the original trilogy and nothing else  can they call themselves a real star wars fan  even though they like less than a third of the movies and none of the tv shows 
1,yep  almost all of the problems with the sequels settings can be traced back to tfa  not tlj 
1,  gonk      lt  lt whrrrr gt  gt     gonk           lt  lt all your batteries are recharged now gt  gt  
1,i ve heard of alphabet squadron but not the others  thanks for the recommendations   i will look into them 
1,  
1,lol i    somehow hadn t heard that part  i ll have to rethink that one   
1,it s not that  it s just so fucking boring 
1,i agree to an extent  there s nothing that explicitly says it was a lie from han
1,he was flying into a beam of energy pushing the opposite direction  he may have been going as fast as he could  but he clearly wasn t moving at full speed  as evidenced by the fact that rose caught up with him 
1,yeah  for a game that s now 14 years old its amazing how good it still is and how many people play it
1,twisting the truth and telling the truth aren t the same thing 
1, one in a million  doesn t mean impossible  they aren t broken  you just have no imagination while watching a movie about a fantasy galaxy that isn t real lmao
1,still can t understand a word you re saying some things never change  i guess 
1,ya  i know most of what goes down in the books just from absorbing other star wars material  but if people think they are essential reads i would consider going through them anyways 
1,such a compelling story 
1,well  for me the last jedi injured my love of star wars enough that when the rise of skywalker came out and i was told palpatine was alive again  my response was  sure  i ll believe it   i didn t want palpatine  he was dead  then they had the audacity to suggest that rey needed training  which tlj very firmly said she was completely perfect in every way  touch her hand with a leaf and now she knows the full extent and ability with the force  she can t even be tempted by the dark side  she gave herself completely to it in exchange for answers and it was apparently like  oh  well    i didn t have the answer prepared since i m used to a little back and forth  but you just dived right in  didn t you   she was so nonplussed by the lack of hospitality and answers that all she needed was the comfort of kylo ren i m not that excited for this script  but then i think it depends on where you thought the sequels went wrong  as you can guess by my ranting  tlj was the worst so tros was okay to me  if you liked tlj  then tros did it dirty my attempt at a third movie would have been this   it s been 30 years since tlj  rey has taken up luke s hiding spot  because the best way to deal with the first order with kylo ren in charge is to not do anything  he runs the first order into the ground by killing anyone who disagrees with his obsessive search for rey  which is all anyone does with her    there s still a splinter faction who made it away from kylo ren s control  however they are now opposed by finn  commander of the free  who s finally grown up and leads ex stormtroopers to new lives as the new fleet of the risen republic  after it was shown to not exist after the first two movies    a new superweapon involves them allying with temiri blagg  the blood drinker of canto bight who was rumored to completely heal himself by drinking the blood of his foes  in truth  he used the force to heal his wounds by taking the blood of those nearby  the new pirate planet of canto bight comes to their aid   kylo ren is confronted by the heroes  but he defeats them in turn  rey appears  talks him down  and they go into exile  tearful send off for those who care  and finn and poe and rose start playfully deciding where the new capital should be  which is led by finn s question of  what planet are we going to be okay getting blown up   and they all choose canto bight as the new capital of the risen republic 
1,eww  she got enough screentime as it is

1,i wished rey s parents weren t important   i wish midichlorians weren t a thing   and i m still confused as why a race of teddy bears build bridges that support the weight of humans   even the hand rails are human height   what  
1,ya  i just can t get behind the writing style  but if people were like  they re amazing just get through the beginning  i would consider it  that s why i posted 
1,nothing  johnson didn t care about the movie that came before tlj and and he didn t care about the movie that came after 
1,the dark  side  is a corruption of the force  rather than an aspect of it  but he did at the end restore balance  by finally ending his master 
1,there s a game called star wars bounty hunter where you play as jango fett best played with a gamecube emulator
1, gt brung
1,  
1,i think the larger part is that a lot of people put a large amount of stock in end results destinations  the prequels can be ignored if people want because it all leads to the beloved characters and stories in the end  the sequels are harder to ignore for those who don t like them because they dictate where those same characters conclude their stories  it can kind of undercut that reunion celebration on endor if you know that almost everything they worked for was reversed or nullified  that leia separates her marriage  han reverts to his scoundrel self we had seen him grow out of  and luke becomes a failed exiled jedi with a defeated mission and only gets a brief and minor moment of redemption before dying 
1,i don t know kylo was also apart of an extremist military who destroyed multiple planets  but what he s ben now so it s okay 
1,i m not making it out to be anything  i m literally listening to the creator of star wars  lol not sure where else this conversation will go at this point  i could dig up more lucas quotes if you want  but folks just don t want to hear them 
1,that s why i d like to get through them  i don t think the story team is going to count them out  but from what i hear there are already contradictions between mando and the books 
1,is this the rts  that game was so fun 
1,hey  i need a favour  i made a subreddit r whatifpalpatinelost and it doesn t have a lot of supporters  could you help me    promote it 
1,crazy how the prequels were so divisive but now everyone almost all fans agree the sequels were a big disappointment
1, gt     but fools hardly differ i ve been told that s the full quote 
1,rots   he s just a guy with a hood on in tpm and atoc
1,i think it was not the norm  however it was more of  theres a  clone  war on  thing than a anakin specific oddity 
1,yes  that s kind of where my mind has gone as well great minds think alike 
1,tldr  the sequels started strong but got lost in the focus between rehashing the past and trying to add original content   that inevitably drew off plot lines from the old contentranking wise  tfa  gt  tlj  gt  ros but y all prolly knew that alreadybest element  adam driver s compelling performanceworst element  palpatine returning  and screwing over john boyega by watering him down to comic relief
1,but sadly    ahsoka leaves   
1,i have seen tlj 3 times and can truthfully say i can count on one hand it s redeeming qualities  i ve tried my best to enjoy it but think the writing is abysmal  comedic points are unnatural   cringey  plot lines feel completely pointless  and even for the context of the star wars universe some shockingly unrealistic things happen where you re just left going  oh     okay  
1, gt  i ve yet to meet a star wars fan who has intelligently articulated why they have a hate boner for that film don t act like there aren t legitimate reasons to hate that film  reasons sw fans bring up all the time  no doubt you re just deeming all those arguments as not  intelligently articulated  because you disagree with them  there s so much wrong with that movie  and you re only fooling yourself if you refuse to acknowledge a legitimate opposing opinion which is expressed on the regular  ignorance is bliss i guess 
1,where have i said  overpowered  this has gone from  special  to  force sensitive  to  jedi  to  overpowered  
1,  
1,god this sub is such a toxic wastedump  good lord 
1,despite the bad acting in the pt  they at least have an overall arc   hayden and portman did what they could  but their lines in aotc and rots were really cringe worthy alot of the time   in comparison  the st trilogy has almost no redeeming features as far as i m concerned   just can it and restart 
1,because jj set up rey s parentage as the greatest mystery of all  that everything was tied into  her bloodline was a looming theme for all of tfa  guessing which family of powerful force users she belonged to was the intended result 
1,  
1, gt i have something to tell you gt for another time
1,based on the definitions i outlined earlier  the story is more or less what i described obviously i didn t take the time to write out a long answer about the minutiae of their character arc  but i did outline the struggle that would be their character arc in a final installment  and i agree interesting events should exist  i just don t care what they are  what they would be is made specifically to push a character to go through the struggles i was describing  i hate the criticism that there was nowhere to go after tlj  because that is a lazy and uncreative answer  interesting events are totally doable  not everything needs to follow a formula with a build up to some big bad cutting out crait would be a horrible idea because it completely neuters the thematic completion of all the character arcs in that movie 
1,definetly tpm  they make it pretty obvious its sidious under that hood  if you were blind tho  in aotc dooku tells obi wan the senate is under the control of a sith lord  and then the final scene shows them meeting on coruscant  if that doesnt do it for you idk what does
1,it is true  and was never discredited  so i m not sure what alternative reality you re attempting to live in
1,if disney didn t give a shit  why d they completely throw it all out with tros and are you seriously suggesting disney didn t give a shit about a multibillion dollar franchise film seriously that s    a take as for lucas  stuff    again  this has been around for decades now and been discussed ad nauseum by me and other star wars nerds for a loooong time and  again  i suggest there s a reason johnson chose the theme that he did and tried to make rey  nobody  and ended on a literal nobody showing he actually was special 
1,or westworld past its first season
1,1  no he literally didn t  he just saw the opportunity to tighten his plan further  anakin was actually getting shown the sith secret handshake and certificate while order 66 was happening he just cleaned up the stragglers  which honestly  palpatine could have done by doubling up the clone troops 2  see point 1    anakin was created to fix the imbalance caused by the sith  he just happened to be a useful idiot sidious could take advantage of 
1,kylo ren and ben solo are pretty much not the same person  same as anakin skywalker and darth vader  she embraces him in that final moment reminiscing what could ve been   because he s finally ben again  she said as much during their final duel  and it actually was the final thing she ever said to him   gt  i did want to take your hand   ben s  hand  
1,having more potential  not automatically being some overpowered person  palpatine was a great politician and schemer which is what left him standing 
1,  gonk      lt  lt whrrrr gt  gt     gonk           lt  lt all your batteries are recharged now gt  gt  
1,johnson had no plans for the story after tlj and did not care to have one  he was only interested in his one and done story in the trilogy  it s why colin treverrow left 
1,   in a race against the  currently charging up weapon which will enable the murder of the entire rebellion  
1,i call bullshit on this  we could have easily opened up episode 8 with a semi established relationship between the two of them  everyone saw luke at the end of tfa and everyone knew rey was seeking him out to train for help would it really confuse the audience if we opened tlj with rey training under luke and saying something like  wow  the last year training under you has been lots of fun master skywalker gee whiz   
1,i would ve loved to see a universe where a new republic  death star  weapon  say a starhawk  was destroyed by a group of terrorists  having the republic have an identity crisis as to how to maintain control and security without becoming the villain  would also do a good job at being relevant to modern politics  something the ot clearly embraced 
1,in our time apart i ve been in many battles  and won nearly all of them  being the best jedi ever  it s kind of hard to lose 
1, gt  control of the senate and the courts  yeah  no  she s the president of lucasfilm  not the ruler of some government system  there s a difference between completely controlling a system and having authority over a system 
1,jj is the real problem with the sequels  he s a fine action director  but he s not great at story  he did his typical mystery box stuff with tfa  and it was an enjoyable enough film  then  rian comes along and follows the logical story points set up in tfa  which means luke is an angry hermit  because why else would he be hiding and not leading  and the backlash is huge  and in a cruel  ironic twist  jj has to return and answer the questions his mystery box posed in tfa  which he himself didn t logically think through  so in tros  jj basically says that luke went to go pout on an island despite knowing palpatine was still out there somewhere 
1,again  genetics isn t this black and white thing you re making it out to be  you can  for example  have olympics level talent in a sport  even if no one in your family has ever even tried that sport in their whole lives  just because you are born with some talent doesn t mean your whole family had it so people could be force sensitive without being the children of force sensitive families  yes  their genetics determine if they are more or less so  but it wouldn t be  always  a direct connection  again  plenty of force sensitive characters have been shown to not be the children of force sensitive people 
1,the story from start to finish was just poor across all three films  they lacked imagination  new bigger death star  palpatine is the final villain   they murdered the original characters and the great arcs lucas created for them  the great jedi knight who turned down palpatine and turned vader to the light  becomes a moron and gives up  leia  a gifted and loved leader  is just the leader of this poorly run rag tag crew of rebels and by the end of tlj her name means nothing   han solo having become a good person just runs and ditches his wife when the going gets tough rey is just not an interesting hero  i never at once felt she was in danger of going to the dark side  she s far too good at everything  basically matching ben solo very quickly  the world building is utter shite  the villains are crap  snoke could of been interesting if he wasn t just a cover for the emperor  ben solo isn t a real villain  it felt clear he was always going to be redeemed they should of had something more with the first order versus the galactic republic and the jedi  rey could be a student of luke s who has an affinity to the dark side  and luke is worried about her  ben solo and another super evil side apprentice serve snoke  leia could be keeping the planets in check and on side while han tries to manage the battles 
1,but lucas actually says the opposite  the midichlorians are kind of a side issue  not in a sort of spiritual  metaphysical part of the force  but the more practical  biological  physical part of the force  or how we come to know the force  which has to do really with the genetics of why some people have more in tune to the force than others    george lucas  tpm dvd commentary and in the phantom menace  palpatine was the one sith lord that was left standing  and he went through a few apprentices before he was betrayed  and that really has to do with certain talent and genes that allow you to be better at what you re doing than other people  
1,the blowback for the last jedi makes me so sad  it s my favorite star wars movie 
1,that s not canon  though   obi wan only trained anakin and got the master rank 
1,  gonk      lt  lt whrrrr gt  gt     gonk           lt  lt all your batteries are recharged now gt  gt  
1,they aren t though if you only like the part of the ip that most of the original fans don t like you re not really a fan of the ip if they like all of it  then fine  they re fans  whatever  but just because something is  official  star wars doesn t mean it s necessarily really star wars  whatever corporate entity that buys the property isn t able to just do whatever they want with it and expect fans to believe that their contribution is automatically as valid as what came before 
1, ow   ben solo s only line of the entire trilogy
1,probably a capo in the black sun syndicate
1,because he wasn t going full speed 
1,wait  gonkbot  my old friend  it s been to long  my batteries haven t been charged in a while 
1,clearly it wasn t going full speed 
1,you re emphasizing how needed the idea that  anyone can be force sensitive  that was well established by lucas in the pt  i may set up a essay on this later  but right now off the top of head  i would point to ep 2 s elevator scene with obi and anakin where obi is knocking anakin s lighsaber skills when anakin gets a big head  there were plenty of jedi s in the cw that were more trusted to get the job done than anakin  if the idea that skywalkers were the end all for force users  that would not have been the case 
1,yeah the ideas in duel of the fates are great but the actual writing of the script is pretty awful  trevorrow basically turned poe and rey into the leads from jurassic world lmao
1,the force is by itself already in balance  it s an energy fields that flows through all living beings  the sith are a disturbance  using the force for destruction and personal gain  jedi are protectors of all life and they must destroy the sith to bring back the balance that was shaken there is no such thing as using a bit of dark side and staying fine  the darkside corrupts all who use it  it consumes its users until they become only a shell of their former selves 
1,so you create a new one  i m sorry your statement makes no sense  you know these characters are fictional and created by people right  you simply create a new one 
1,so here s a few problems that occur with duel of the fates as we know it rey  she s supposed to become some sort of  new thing   finding balance  but the problem is  from the very start rey and ben are clearly meant to exhibit a yin yang relationship  both embodying the light and dark  this dotf really details this  not to mention  anakin  yoda  luke  and i d argue qui gon and obi wan  have all achieved perfect balance at the moment of death  this is why they become force spirits  so they idea that rey is some  new thing   doesn t match up with the rest of star wars luke  while at first i sounds intriguing to take luke literal  him haunting kylo opens a huge can of worms  because now we have to ask  if luke is able to converse with kylo  then why didn t qui gon or obi wan ever talk to vader  secondly it undermines luke s character  as he s completely given up on ben solo  when in tlj he was the one that told leia  no one is ever really gone  fallen order connection  yeah  there isn t one  i ve heard people say this  but tor valum is not a zeffo  potential rebels connection  again there isn t one  kathleen as spoken to the fact that colin was at a disadvantage  having not been apart of those early meetings  which would have included the likes of michael ardnt  jj abrams  lawrence kasden  rian johnson  dave filoni  and many others  so this was just colin pulling stuff from the larger expanded universe in a sloppy  and vain attempt to  connect  everything 
1, gt johnson and disney  let s be clear about that really   pretty sure disney didn t really give a shit   they probably figured that theme would have mass appeal so they gave it the thumbs up the stuff lucas said about the prequels is interesting   hadn t heard that before   makes the whole idea of jedis going out into the galaxy to find young force users pretty weird   rather than having to search the galaxy you could just have a genetic database   also the fact that jedis don t tend to reproduce makes the idea of strong force use being genetic pretty weird   i kinda thought it was more random genetic mutation  luck  than it was inheritance   also you can have genes that don t get expressed for whatever reason with your lifestyle  though i guess it is doubtful lucas knew or was talking about that 
1, gt  in the legends continuity  yes  but even then  it did go against lucas and what he said  gt   gt  vapaad is canon though  iirc  all the lightsaber forms are  including his  gl being against something doesn t automatically make it untrue  his world has evolved beyond his vision  balance between the two is compelling and makes for a good story  light side only being balanced makes no sense
1,  
1,ok brainless
1,colin s script would have been 10x worse than tros  it s completely misunderstands what balance in the force is for one  kylo s ending is worse  and it completely undoes anakin s sacrifice by bringing another sith  whereas in tros at least palpatine was literally dead for sometime before being resurrected 
1,empire at war  forces of corruption  strategy game  is one of the best games i ve ever played  the base game is great and the expansion improves further on it  also the modding community is amazing
1,pure rpg  knights of the old republic i and iiaction  jedi knight  jedi outcast and jedi academyaction w rpg elements  fallen orderfps  battlefront ii and republic commandohaven t played any of the ones that would be considered strategy 
1,and she actually has valid  logically sound reasons for believing so  i ve yet to meet a star wars fan who has intelligently articulated why they have a hate boner for that film  i ll grant that it s not a strong film  but for none of the reasons that star wars fans argue 
1,1  palpatine needed anakin on his side in order for order 66 to be successful2  if not for anakin then both orders would not have been eliminated and balance would not have been brought to the force  i don t see how you re not getting this even after it s been spelled out for you multiple times 
1,if when they start exploring the post sequels time period i hope that this is something that they touch upon 
1,jj did what he loves to do and presented us with a mystery box  rian took that mystery box and instead of opening it all  he picked the things that were narratively important  like rey s parents  what happened to luke  and used them to challenge the characters and the audience instead of pander to them  he outright says that rey hearing her parents were nobodies was the hardest truth for her to have to face  that they truly left her alone and traded her off for drinking money  just like how luke s hardest truth was that this monster he wanted to kill was actually his father it s almost as though he thought it through in a vacuum instead of pandering to the star wars theorists 
1,wow  i had no idea about this  this seems like it would have been amazing 
1,this is the way 
1,man  this is such a stretch  you know precisely what lucas is saying as he discusses a saga about a particular family 
1,i mean i guess  i m not sure how you go about that since the villains they created for the st were all palpatine puppets
1,so what you re saying is now we can solely blame the haters for  rise   bully them and push them out of the fandom does that mean we can get  r saltierthancrait purged as a hate subreddit ¬†  for   those   that   need   it  s
1,the last jedi did nothing different  it was as much of a riff in esb as tfa was anh and its entire theme was  any nuance is a red herring  there is only good and evil  empire vs rebellion   it just disguised itself as different with some arbitrary spinning around and disjointed framing 
1,i think the body is a clone with palpatine s original spirit inside  effectively bound to it like momin to his mask  the issue is his clone bodies are unable to handled the transfer thus causing him to basically inhabit a corpse by the time thw ritual is complete  i doubt the body we see in the film is his first clone 
1,that s nice 
1,it s mainly because it s such a big deal for the particular character as the audience  people were speculating wildly about who rey s parents could be  it wasn t so much established by the movies but by the audience itself  the mystery of rey s parents  had  to mean there was something to hide as rey  she truly believed her parents were coming back for her  she carries this through the entire first movie and only wavers when maz tells her to stop carrying it  that they aren t coming back for her  rey maybe takes this as they died  or something happened  rey s newfound path as a jedi further convinces herself that she has a place in this world  that she isn t just  rey from nowhere  kylo s reveal that her parents sold her for drinking money completely shatters that  it shatters the notion the audience built for themselves  and it shatters rey s belief that she has a place somewhere  had parents that cared about her  as rian johnson explains it  vader s reveal is the hardest thing for both luke and the audience to hear at that moment  the  nobody  moment is the exact same 
1,my favourite legends force user was always jolee bindo for being  grey 
1,no  genetics is not the same as lineage  other than maybe in the distant past  shared genetic structure might be a common factor  just like not all left handed people are related  or all red heads genetic potential can happen in relative isolation  or are you saying cal kestis could only be a jedi because he is related to yoda edit  look at it this way     if the force is triggered by genetics  then matching would be far looser than exact match  otherwise only dynasties would have force talent 
1,nah  new camry based four door coupe crossover for sure
1,yeah  that s probably the case  i just think the insurgent enemy would have been more interesting than just another comic book  but this enemy can eat  galaxies      villain inflation 
1,op tied his post into star wars  rebels and they also do a fantastic job of exploring that dark light divide 
1,the son represents death  without him  there would be infinite daytime and creation in mortis until it was overgrown and therefore destroyed  the only reason mortis fell to disarray was because the father  the control  was dying and weakened  not because he allowed his son to live the problem here is lucas made star wars contradictory by including both eastern and western philosophy into one entity  he even calls himself a buddhist methodist  despite those being pretty contradictory ideologies we have dark  light  and a balance   indicating that they re connected  this is very taoist buddhist   that the dark and light are two poles of one vibrating energy  in that philosophy  you cannot destroy one or the other without destroying nature itself  the only truth is to make yourself totally empty and therefore to follow what in the star wars universe is the  will of the force   but if you do that  if the force willed you to do something dark  does that make it wrong  because if the divine will is present in all things  it is present then in even the most despicable acts  for example  vader had to fall so far to the dark to realize there was no good ending there  which helped him turn back the other way but at the same time  we have labeled light and dark good and evil  indicating the dark is something different  corrupt  something that must be eradicated  this directly conflicts with the buddhist philosophy and is the christian segment of the whole thing  reject the dark  embrace the light  so you are then rejecting half of the force  which doesn t make any sense really  because the more you try to prevent darkness  the more fearful you become and the more you end up creating it in the end  as prequel jedi did  basically you cannot both say the universe is created by one good energy field consisting of two sides  and then also say simultaneously one side needs to be eliminated  then you eliminate the universe as we know it  the philosophy  under any direct inspection  doesn t really work  you could say they re both in there so that people can pick and choose which parts they want to believe  but then if that s the case  you can t call someone wrong for picking the  eastern  aspects over the  western  ones 
1,i guess a big part of it is that i don t really feel that it impacts the ot if the sequels are lame  it s like how the weirdness of the prequel trilogy didn t affect how i view the original movies  either 
1,this dead end comment feels like the right place to post this gripe  but   if finn is going full speed on a kamikaze run  how the fuck does rose turn around and catch up to him in an identical vehicle 
1,i agree with this   people are just using their imaginations  i doubt the final movie would ve matched it 
1,love mr  sunday movies
1,i ve been doing a whole chronological star wars rewatch and i m up through episodes 8 and 9 and most of resistance and i think the problem the world of the sequel trilogy runs so much deeper than just the conclusion to the story  i also really like tfa and tlj but the base problem with it all was the establishment of the world  the new republic is a complete after thought and the first order is just established as new evil  there s a literal cold war happening in the lead up of the first order s attack on hosnian prime but nothing in either the show or movies gives any sort of context to them besides  they re bad   i had to go to wookiepedia to learn that a section of the new republic actually seceded to the first order i just feel like the sequels spent too much on mystery boxing new characters and re establishing old characters and a complete lack of time establishing the state of the galaxy  to help understand on a deeper level what the good guys are fighting for  and i m really disappointed that resistance doesn t do for the sequels what clone wars does for the prequels and rebels does for the ot
1,luke makes no sense in tlj because the og trilogy made it very clear that he isn t like the original jedi  to luke being a jedi is not about the religion  it s simply about his connection to the force  compassion and love  which is why he prevails in the moments where obi wan  yoda and all the other jedi made mistakes  he embraces people no matter what  believes everyone deserves a second chance and would rather solve things with words rather than using his lightsaber in a way he already redefines what being a jedi should be  that it s something as easy as breathing  and not the weird cult that the original jedi order was  i feel like the new trilogy should be about something completely different  because we already had 2 trilogies dealing with who the jedi should really be 
1, gt  i mean that s really only proof that that was how johnson interpreted it johnson  and disney   let s be clear about that      gt the prequels made it pretty clear to me that anyone can be a very powerful force user without coming from some kind of special bloodline then you should read what lucas said about the prequels  the midichlorians are kind of a side issue  not in a sort of spiritual  metaphysical part of the force  but the more practical  biological  physical part of the force  or how we come to know the force  which has to do really with the genetics of why some people have more in tune to the force than others    george lucas  tpm dvd commentary and in the phantom menace  palpatine was the one sith lord that was left standing  and he went through a few apprentices before he was betrayed  and that really has to do with certain talent and genes that allow you to be better at what you re doing than other people  
1,this is 100  correct from my perspective  i have the same feeling about the sequels as you do  enjoyed tfa  loved tlj  think tros destroyed it all   and am adamant when talking with friends about it that the problem isn t  they didn t have a plan  but that they didn t stick with the plan  of course  this stance is based on the fact that i think tlj builds on tfa instead of rejecting it  which i know now everyone believes  to me  there s a difference between  the next movie didn t take the open questions in the direction i wanted or expected  and  the next movie openly reverses what was said in the previous one  the underlying issue with pushing for duel of the fates is   i still think trevorrow would have made a relatively weak star wars movie  the negative points people are pointing out in the comments here attest to that  also  i just haven t liked trevorrow s blockbuster moviemaking  in the timeline where he went ahead and made it  episode ix is one of the three worst star wars movies and everyone is bummed about it  they just don t know about this timeline where it was easily the worst one anyway  great post 
1,even among the star wars books  i still found it to be mediocre 
1,hey  that s mr  scumbag movies to you 
1,i wholeheartedly agree   sums up my thoughts on the sequels except i rate tlj lower  in my bottom 3rd of star wars films rankings  but i didn t mind them trying something a little different  it s a damn shame 
1,  
1,by catching up to his speeder that was going full speed after she had already turned around   easily my least favorite of the whole saga edit  no hate towards kelly  she was very likeable  i just thought the whole film was a mess  threw away everything the force awakens started and just made little sense 
1,  
1,i love how when tlj came out  even the people that disliked it right off the bat would concede that the rey kylo stuff was good  specifically the throne room then  months later  cooridor digital released a video where they show a couple frame by frame breakdowns of the praetorian fight that reveal some imperfect choreography  soon afterwards  everyone who hated tlj started doubling down on it and started nitpicking that fight as if they noticed those flaws from the start    but they didn t  instead they nitpicked bombs dropping in a universe where artificial gravity exists  remember that one  they all shut up real quick about that  then red letter media released their vomit comet and everyone jumped in on those points   again  as if they were being original  i would love someone to do a history of tlj backlash  because the things people bitched about at first have kinda just disappeared in favor of whatever the youtubr breakdown reaction review of the week told them to think  except canto bite  hate for that has been consistent across the entirety of that movie s history 
1,how did anakin eliminate the jedi order  if he never existed  what would have changed  they d still get torn down by him via order 66 and the slow grind of war casualties  anakin was not a factor in the order s demise  he just did pest control after the fact 
1,i m one of the few last jedi  haters  that was still excited to go see this film  i would have loved duel of fates i can tell  nothing about rise of skywalker lived up to what i hoped  i might have disliked where the story went in 8 but if they had vision and creative ideas such as luke haunting kylo  mortis  and gave arcs to characters who were left without like finn  i would be a sequel fan

1,i mean  it would have been quite eye roll no setup  i m just going to leave this here for the kids or whatever  bs  you re funny right  but that shit would not have belonged or made sense
1,tell that to george lucas  then  the midichlorians are kind of a side issue  not in a sort of spiritual  metaphysical part of the force  but the more practical  biological  physical part of the force  or how we come to know the force  w  hich has to do really with the genetics   of why some people have more in tune to the force than others    george lucas  tpm dvd commentary and in the phantom menace  palpatine was the one sith lord that was left standing  and he went through a few apprentices before he was betrayed  and that really has to do with   certain talent and genes   that allow you to be better at what you re doing than other people  
1, gt  people are asking for proof  but the proof is the fact that tlj exists in the form it doesi mean that s really only proof that that was how johnson interpreted it   i d say  given this comment thread  it s pretty clear that some people were under the impression that bloodlines were particularly important in star wars  while some people  myself included  weren t  the prequels made me think that anyone can be a very powerful force user  provided they are lucky enough to be gifted with a connection to the force in the first place  without coming from some kind of special bloodline 
1,i totally disagree with you and most of this is based on your assumptions and personal opinions from art work and an unproduced first draft script  sometimes your imagination can fill in all the gaps and create better image than the final product could ve delivered  it s happened to me with some scripts and even movie trailers  so much could happen from first draft to second draft  during actual production and ultimately completely change a script during editorial  i don t think trevorrows movie would ve done better at all than jjs simply because the main issues of the story exists in tfa 
1, so basically here s what we should have gotten vs what we did   
1,like i said   gt  during tpm 
1,i know the scene you re talking about  it s not confirmed the holdo maneuver and you know it  it s a busted star destroyer in the hazy distance  and let s say it is for argument purposes  that tells you how broken the last jedi and rise of skywalker are that they re contradicting themselves within their own movie 
1,give me the logic for them to match speeds exactlythat doesn t even happen irl  much less with space ships
1,yes  i agree it s all jj abrams fault because he is a hack  him and joss whedon  two peas in a pod 
1,as far as we knew in tfa  that s kind of what they were  till in tlj they came back with that huge fleet and dialogue said 100 times  this is empire vs rebellion   in the opening of tfa  poe is looking around the star destroyer like   wtf is this   i understand why they tried to open with something familiar  but tlj just cemented it so bad 
1,you re fundamentally misunderstanding the film  then  broom boy isn t the point   nobody  is the point rey is  nobody  because  at least in tlj  you don t have to have a force lineage to be special and have special powers  broom boy is just the ending image designed to punctuate that it s not about literally being a skywalker  it s about lineage and genetics 
1,given enough time probably yeah
1,you re right  it wasn t meant that way  but i think it should be that way regardless 
1,okay nvm  you re clearly one of of those deranged lunatic fans  how about  you  gtfoh 
1,good thoughts  i agree  he could ve gone either way with neither feeling strange 
1,yeah people who think someone could wield the dark side and light side equally just don t understand what the dark side does to you 
1,sure  but same difference really vader  projects  a level or power and control that kylo wishes he could and that s part of the point of his character 
1,you re missing the point  the prophecy came true because anakin was crucial in eliminating both the jedi and sith orders  this is how balance was brought to the force before the sequel trilogy retconned it 
1,problem is that it doesn t make any sense  you use more of the force and that s it  so  why did vader become evil in like 5 mins and went to kill small kids 
1,i think that the idea that  balance  is equal parts light and dark is a bad idea  it s not george lucas  idea in any case  i m glad we got the pointless nonsense we did instead of having that concept be canon the light side is balance and harmony  the dark side is a twisted chaotic perversion of that  not its harmonic counter balance  the dark side is also very corrupting and addictive  dabbling in it too much ensures that you ll be consumed by it  just because everything is fucked now in current decade doesn t mean we have to make everything a shade a gray that said i like the concept of a gray jedi  but only in so far as they can be uniquely wise and powerful and still be largely in control  but only in the sense of an extremely careful high functioning meth user  and they re always on a knife edge from falling apart 
1,i read a comment once that said it would have been a really interesting concept to have a 3 way power struggle for control of the galaxy between the new republic  the first order  and the remnants of the empire i agree on the diminished achievements of luke han and leia though  the new movies especially ruin han s character arc  in the ot he rises from selfish lone smuggler to rebellion general galaxy legend  then in tfa he s back to smuggling but doesn t even have the falcon or leia  and then gets killed by his own son 
1,i mean you can watch it chronologically  it has the episodes in that order  i m just asking when would a first time viewer catch on out of curiosity
1,i had already checked out by ros disney in general was responsible for the sorry reception of the st   tfa was a passable b level film that i just glossed over since it was disney s first foray into sw  the tlj just kind of sealed the st as junk for me 
1,ok  don t believe me  but perhaps believe george lucas  the midichlorians are kind of a side issue  not in a sort of spiritual  metaphysical part of the force  but the more practical  biological  physical part of the force  or how we come to know the force  which has to do really with the genetics of why some people have more in tune to the force than others    george lucas  tpm dvd commentary and in the phantom menace  palpatine was the one sith lord that was left standing  and he went through a few apprentices before he was betrayed  and that really has to do with certain talent and genes that allow you to be better at what you re doing than other people  yes  i m totally crazy and off base 
1,  
1,all matter of time and space is completely wrecked in tlj how about the fo ships and res cruiser having identical speedgtfoh rian johnson
1,lol the guy calling out  coded  can t tell people apart holy shit wow
1,more like vader is better at covering his    issues in front of people  to where they think he s calm  focused  and always in control 
1,gotta keep her relevant somehow
1,thanks  i think the acronyms started with the star wars dictionary in the 90s and it all sticks in my brain  can t say the same for algebra 
1,i think i would have been fine with all of that  honestly  this is coming from someone who doesn t mind the sequels  by the way 
1,well of course  but the in universe reasoning was  his chosen lightsaber combat technique   which drew heavily on the dark side 
1,then to counter that you d need broom boy to actually be  special  in the story as it stands his inclusion shows that you don t need to be a skywalker to be a force user  which is something that has been shown in literally every movie in the series it s making a point that never needed to be made 
1,i think somewhere in tros novel  they explain that the palpatine in that movie was a clone of the original  but don t quote me on that 
1,the fall of the order was a direct orchestration of sidious and a millennia of sith intervention  it was inevitable with or without anakin  he was brought in by the cosmic force to heal the corruption caused by sith abuse  that s the prophecy of the chosen one 
1,the problem was they didn t have a clear vision for every one of their characters  daisy ridley and jon boyega have both come out saying that there wasn t a clear path for their characters 
1,  
1, deleted 
1,completely agree  episode 9 with jj was fan service and  damage control   i m amazed how little episode 9 gets brought up  it s truly the most dull and pointless movie in the franchise 
1,its one of my favorite scenes in the movie and i started tearing up in the theater when r2 played leia s message from anh  as someone who really enjoyed tlj on my first viewing  its moments like this scene that remind me what i love about it  it s not perfect  but if you trim some of the fat there are a lot of really great scenes throughout and i m overall a fan of the kylo and rey story 
1,love this  thanks for putting more examples down that explain what i feel  rian s movie would be great if it were framed as a movie like rogue one or solo   another film that adds to the story from the universe and helps us understand where things are while also taking into consideration all the known lore and restrictions  it s just unfortunate that tfa created all of those restrictions in the first place in a movie that was supposed to kick off an entirely new storyline 
1,definitely do new hope first  only thing is  i was rewatching it this morning and realised i had forgotten that vader wasn t really as menacing as he is in later content  but rouge one in particular should help with that 
1,great point that i ve never seen mentioned before  and i freaking love absorbing myself in r saltierthancrait type material 
1,without giving away spoilers   yes  but not right away 
1,tros should ve gotten the 2 parts that the writers wanted tbh  that would ve helped  a lot  
1,well i skipped the majority of it after i got bored of it and have reached the siege of mandalore  feel like i ve missed very little and this episode feels like proper star wars
1,according to the link i gave you  finn said it  but that doesn t change the point i m trying to make 
1,apparently the writers for tros said the finn s sudden and never clearly established force sensitvity was their way of continuing the theme of  nobodies can be jedi  from tlj ya know  instead of just  actually carrying that theme through the character it was established with  and not having the line  your parents were nobodies  but your grandfather we obviously know lineage isn t everything  obi wan and ahsoka are some of the greatest jedi to ever live and their parentage doesn t mean squat  but it worked so well with rey because both her  and  the audience expect her parents to be some epic reveal  and so when it s the exact opposite it s such a gut punch  and actually works as a theme  kylo ren had every reason to become a hero  and didn t  meanwhile rey has a villain s backstory  being abandoned  scrounging for herself  taken advantage of by slime like unkar plutt  she has every reason to become a villain  and yet she doesn t that s so much more compelling than but your grandpappy was the emperor  and everyone knows that  evil  is  genetic  
1,sure  i ll face it  along with jedii siblings tiplar and tiplee source  and stass allie and cousin adi galliasource  but nah  no bloodlines in star wars now s the part where you insist that they re only periphery characters and aren t actually evidence to my point or we could ask george lucas  what he thinks  the midichlorians are kind of a side issue  not in a sort of spiritual  metaphysical part of the force  but the more practical  biological  physical part of the force  or how we come to know the force  which has to do really with the   genetics of why some people have more in tune to the force than others      george lucas  tpm dvd commentary please tell me again how it s batshit crazy to suggest that perhaps    perhaps    genetics may play a part in being force sensitive 
1,though given his reputation  he could 1v1 a krayt dragon  both canyon and greater 
1, gt  the only part i could see as a direct copy is starkiller base  but that makes sense to be a copy because of kylo sobsession with vaderwhy would kylo make a litteral superweapon planet just because of his obsession with darth vader  and besides he isint even the leader of the first order  snoke is so it makes even less sense now   gt the fight at the end is one of my favourite duels in the filmsthe whole fight was litterally kylo being not able to use a lightsaber for some reason even though luke fucking skywalker traineƒè him  and somehow rey won the duel while the only thing she did was trying to stab him   gt and i feel it set up some great concepts and questions for the future  that unfortunatly were never payed off in a satisfying way  it was impossible to make a sequel to this because of the fact that it was so similair to a new hope  thats why the last jedi was also very similair to the empire strikes back  because rian was backed into a corner   gt it took scenes from the new hope and altered them with different contextno it wasn t  most of the motivations where the exact same as in a new hope  the rebels are looking for a droid because it contains important information  they have to blow a giant planet killing weapon etc etc  the movie was god awfull in my opinion  but i am glad you found something to like in it 
1,but why  because lucas said so 
1,i think because this is literally the skywalker saga   true  there is much more space for other characters and stories in the star wars universe  but trying to force this idea just to make a point or going against the expectations at the end of this 40 year long story ultimately proved to be a bad idea 
1,you know the concept of infinite monkeys and infinite typewriters  of course there will be patterns like that  but it doesn t reinforce the idea of lineage mattering  or that you have to be somebody to be force sensitive  two siblings having an auto immune disease doesn t mean the disease is genetic  it just means two relatives happen to have this disease  which i can atest to personally  and arguably  maul s planet was generally force adept to some extent also  you had 50 000 jedi at its height  and four of those were related  that s just a statistical chance  i ll repeat again  the skywalkers were the only  lineage   and that was due to direct intervention from the cosmic force 
1,broom boy is in the dof script   he s a minor character 
1,and you would be correct 
1,the romance could ve worked imo coming off of their chemistry in tlj  the problem was that tros didn t do anything to earn the kiss  they had two options 1 	develop their relationship and force bond more and make their connection more explicitly romantic   spiritual   whatever to make the kiss feel earned at the end or   2 	revert them to antagonizing each other  which is also a valid if safe choice given the way their last interaction goes in tlj  and scrap the kiss altogether  abrams and terrio tried to take a bit from column a and column b which just did not feel right at all  compelling storytelling requires that hard decisions and commitments be made by the storytellers  a recurring issue with tros for me is that it seemed like they were trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator  which led to an experience that didn t fully 100  satisfying for any camp of the fandom 
1,starting with the spin offs could indeed be good  i personally loved solo and rogoue one
1,everyone enjoys jizz music
1,hmmm how bout when he goes to mandalore  wouldn t that be the real reveal  doesn t he straight up say  ready my shuttle   before it happens 
1,it s not technically what ruined tlj as many  many other things contributed to that  but it was in my opinion a terribly thought out idea  the entire plot with holdo and poe was equally as bad as the canto bight sequence 
1,the biggest problem with the last jedi  really the biggest issue r√≥bleme with the sequels in general  was that there didn t seem to be an oversight of the story through all three movies  the force awakens was fine and gave us a lead in to the last jedi  if abrams had made that movie  there would have been different decisions in storytelling  and the three movies would have come to likely the same end with one cohesive story  if r√≠an johnson had made the rise of skywalker  the decisions would have likely been different  but the story would have been cohesive  because of the change between them  it seemed like the story arc between the three movies went wonky it didn t stop me from enjoying them for what they were  but the story was disjointed 
1,yeah  but lucas is wrong   it s pretty clear  that the jedi were religious fanatics dedicated to a dualistic heresy   their attachment to non attachment makes them fall to the dark side again  and again 
1,my issue is that there is a lot of story to tell and a lot of a characters to flesh out and bring to life but a very limited amount of time to do it   that s just my two cents   let the conflict get fleshed out maybe two tie in movies or a series  like a first order origin or how they get all their stuff back after losing a planet sized base   there s a lot of story that goes untold 
1,i am currently watching it myself  maybe i ll restart and she can join in  but talking about it with her  she is more interested in the jedi and the sith   i think that s dealt with in mando as well  but i am really not far in still i will ask her  thanks
1,and happened in 1 movie lmao
1,you should watch them again then  tfa and tlj aren t perfect  but they didn t kill star wars as much as the overcorrection that was ros 
1,yes vader had a temper  but he never  lost control   he never threw fits or tantrums  yes  he got mad at subordinates and punished them  but was always in control of his temper 
1,it would have been mildly interesting to see what he would have done with the movie but to act like the lack of a cohesive plan for the 3 movies  amp  johnson s absolute mess of tlj aren t major issues is just turning a blind eye 
1,yep  it s the exact shit that happened with korra a while back  i m not rey s biggest fan  but she gets way too much hate  and it s largely from youtube videos  she 100  made mistakes and failed along the way 
1,awesome  thank you fair point about the reunion  i didn t remember that scene at  all  
1,if you are talking about the prequels i agree  way too much cgi 
1,i do actually agree with you  on every point  i would kill to see  duel  made  the only unmade film i want more badly than this is vincent ward s version of  alien iii  
1,no disagreement there
1,  
1,with  the force awakens  abrams was mainly just trying to replicate the original trilogy with a new empire  a new rebel alliance and even a new death star  but johnson and treverrow were clearly trying to use his foundations to build a more unique story with its own meaningful message  after hearing the script synopsis for  duel of the fates  i feel as though the trilogy was originally going to be mainly built around the idea that history is bound to be repeated by those who don t learn from it  which i think could have complimented and built off the original saga very nicely before the prequels came  the original trilogy ends on a strong note with the promise that luke will rebuild the old jedi order  but i had originally felt that the prequels weakened this by showing the jedi order being run by arrogant procrastinating hypocrites  and the idea that luke would rebuild this jedi order didn t sit well with me because i always felt there was a good chance he d make the same mistakes  i wasn t familiar with the eu  but i think  the last jedi  and especially  duel of the fates  would have remedied this really well   tlj  directly points out that the past jedi order was inherently flawed and the jedi were doomed by their own mistakes  but as yoda points out  failure is just as important a teacher as success  then in  duel of the fates  rey comes to understand what luke meant by  the force does not belong to the jedi  and realises that to split dark and light into jedi and sith  good and evil  is an outdated and limited way to view the force and how to use it so the goal in  duel of the fates   and the saga as a whole  would no longer be about  rebuilding  the jedi order  but  replacing  it  taking what worked about the past  understanding what didn t  and making something new and better out of it unfortunately  unlike johnson and treverrow  abrams just dismisses the prequels and their importance to the story because he only wants to homage the original trilogy  so instead he cops out by bringing back palpatine and making the conflict entirely dark vs light again  and the sequel trilogy ends the exact same way  return of the jedi  did  rey s going to rebuild the jedi order just like luke was  and there s nothing to indicate that she won t just make the same mistakes that luke and his predecessors did  duel of the fates  probably wouldn t have pleased the people who didn t like the last two films  at this point i don t think anything would have   but  the rise of skywalker  didn t even please the ones that did  and it actively robs the sequel trilogy of its narrative coherence and meaning 
1,  
1,i had assumed it was building to a story about kylo being a conflicted leader who eventually comes back to the light and the resistance working to rally the galaxy against the first order while maybe palpatine s spirit starts influencing things and becomes a shared threat or something  or  even general hux could ve performed a coup and the knights of ren could ve stayed loyal to the fo i don t knowreally just fucking anything that isn t the contrived mess of artifact plots and retcons we got  so disappointing after tlj was such a character driven piece 
1,that s a pretty good observation   if i had read a plot summary of the prequels  it would sound pretty good   but the visuals and the acting and the dialogue  were so bad     the thing that really fell flat was anakin s fall to the dark side  which just   wasn t 
1,it was supposed to have been a  reveal  in rots  but if you have no memory of star wars and watch tpm and don t think there s something up with that palpatine dude lookin  like maul s master under his hood  you might need to check your ocular prescription 
1,as one of the best star wars movie that has been made  rian was trying to pull star wars away from the fun  but safe journey tfa setup   it was unfortunate jj did not follow through in what had been setup in tlj and went right back to the same dynamic we had already seen  despite how enjoyable it is watching ian be palpatine   tros has some moments i like but overall i think it fell a little short of where it could ve gone 
1,meh  if we all accept that qui gon training anakin wpuld have been enough to stop him from turning to the dark side then we re already splitting hairs i dont think its crazy to assume that if mace had been nicer to anakin he wouldnt have gone to stop him confronting palpatine  anakin felt ostracized by the jedi council and that feeling of otherness directly led to his choices not trying to knock mace  if being nice to anakin was the difference between life or death thats definitely on anakins shoulders for being unstable  but i think something as trivial as just being nicer to the guy could have made a huge difference
1,i suggest watching 4 5 6 first  starting with the prequels reveals that vader is luke and leia s father  if she doesn t like  how old 4 is  see about watching rouge one  or solo if she quite likes han and or chewie 
1,i was actually kind of annoyed by rey and kylos romantic thing  i mean he fucking killed han and you re gonna smooch him  i liked their connection in general but i thought the romantic direction was a mistake 
1,the first order wasn t big at all       except for the fact that the supremacy was literally 60km wide and had a crew of 2 million it can dock 2 star destroyers inside itself     they could have sent more than 4 damn tie fighters
1, gt  rey being a gray jedi i love most details about it except this  grey jedis should stay non canon  a character is either a jedi or they are not 
1,so are you saying that all force sensitives recruits are the illegitimate children from all the jedi masters  fucking around and nowhere else 
1,episode 7 backs a lot of things into scriptwriting corners   the next movie can t have a time jump  separates the main characters  kylo renn is injured  snoke  aka evil old ugly baddie 2 0 exists   rey needs to know what happened to her parents  luke abandoned everyone to the point where han solo died   the hero beats the villain in the first movie  which goes against typical story structure   empire vs  rebels 2 0honestly  what rian did to deal with this pigeonholed script was really fun
1,i mean  there s many elements to order s failure  of course that detachment is huge part  as that s what left anakin vulnerable and in need of acceptance palpatine was happy to provide  but there s also arrogance that came from maintaining 1000 years of peace  there s their heavy involvement in war and politics  they were also stuck in the past  expecting sith enemies to be the same they were a millennium ago palpatine was only able to achieve such complete victory and establish empire because jedi order at time has reached status of complete failure  as yoda admits  consumed by the dark side  the jedi were 
1,i liked the sequels  and i think your post is well written and sounds interesting even though i dont know much at all about the duel or the fates movie  however  my largest criticism is of the actual story in tlj   i dont think that film did anything at all to advance any real storyline  only a few character story arcs  and those seemed to fall flat of expectations    the film started with the first order chasing the resistance and basically ended the same way with what felt like only a couple of hours passing and with nothing accomplished 
1,ah my bad  ill fix that
1,k
1, gt  but at least he legit diedjust like he did in return of the jedi 
1,you mention three families  but there are hundreds of characters who are shown to be force sensitive without having their family matter obi wan  qui gon  mace windu  count dooku  ki adi mundi  etc  and even in the old and the current expanded universe  ahsoka  ezra  kanan  cal kestis  and others  all are very powerful force users who did not have force sensitive parents  or at least not force sensitive enough to be jedi  moreover  the jedi s core tenet that jedi should not create families directly goes against any idea that force sensitivity is   only   passed on genetically  and cannot be naturally gained  because if your theory is correct  then a lot of force sensitive people not being able to have kids would very quickly diminish the number of force sensitive beings in the galaxy  and the prequels show that 1  the jedi have been around for thousands of years  and 2  there are still a ton of jedi your whole argument seems to be the equivalent of saying that because lebron james jr  is good at basketball and his father is the best  then the only people who can be good basketball players are the sons of basketball players  sure  it probably  helps  to have some inherited talent  but there s plenty of good basketball players whose parents never picked up a basketball in their lives  same goes for force sensitive users  yes  if one or both of your parents are force sensitive  then chances are you will be a powerful one too  but being born force sensitive doesn t mean your parents were as well 
1,i think the best way is to find something in the star wars universe that gets her attention  for a lot of newcomers that s recently  the mandolorian  after watch that she may have a interest and start asking questions about the back stories of characters and why things are a certain way  that way when you go back and watch the movies you can make her more interested in what s going on 
1,i agree  i also found the very end of mandalorian season 2 to be a let down  at this point i m more bored than mad 
1,luke s last stand was to save one of the last jedi and to keep the rebellion alive 
1,nah  what s funny here is that you think that this is actually an argument  even if it was true and not something that was discredited long ago  
1,tor vallum specifically says he s not a sith 
1,well they certainly had more chemistry then rey and kylo  who they ultimately thought should kiss 
1,it sure did  people always say tlj ruined luke s character when he tossed the lightsaber away  but how else is anyone supposed to explain why luke isolated himself and let the first order rise to power while his sister desperately tries to fight them off  hiding from his responsibilities is the only thing that makes sense 
1,huh  have you not watched or read any star wars before the sequels 
1,the arc is far from filler 
1, gt the mandalorian has made it clear remnants of the empire still exists and have been trying to reorganize  it always came off as a continuation to me  gt the resistance exists due to the new republic just being formed too weak  as a way to prevent the fall into a new empire  that again seems pretty normal to me  sure  i can understand small imperial pockets still existing being run by warlords  but how can an entire army form up capable of building massive flagship star destroyers and the biggest death star yet  they are not reusing any old tech  where did they get the resources for that  your explanation for the resistance existing because the new republic was too weak is just an assumption  not a fact explained in the movies  and again there s a whole movie s worth of explanation to do regarding the rise of the first order and the failings of new republic to make the state of both factions in tfa believable  you can assume how things went down sure but in the end it s just an assumption maybe you bought luke wanting to exile himself because of that one big mistake but in tlj  once he learns the trouble the galaxy was in  a luke consistent with the original trilogy would spring back and head into the mix without hesitation because the stakes were so large  he wouldn t be so selfish as to not even heed the distress call from his sister  so i do feel the core of his character is no longer what it once was despite the tragedy he faced with ben  even mark hamill himself felt that way 
1,with the ot you ask   who the fuck is darth vader    and the pt answers it   where the fuck did the empire come from   the pt answers it  with the st   who the fuck is kylo ren   rewinding to episode 6 yields no answers   where the fuck did the empire come from   no answers 
1,interesting line of thought  however  even if it were possible or feasible  it would never made it further than a last ditch effort  ships are expensive to build  hyperdrives are not parts than one would be willing to sacrifice in a single use basis  i do believe that this worked because of two important factors  narrative tension  we often forget that these are stories  after all  and work in such ways  and  more in universe  because the first order was not expecting it  it was a sucker punch  and it worked  but if any group were to make a habit out of it  they d run out of ships in no time  without an actual warranty of accomplishing significant success  after all  a ship designed for war is supposed to be  tactically speaking  able to give you an advantage in resources  a ship that is good only to take down another ship produces no effective advantage  a single star destroyer was able to take on several opposing ships  that  in term  makes them valuable resources anyway  that is my opinion and i could be wrong  i just shared to enrich the debate 
1,feel free to prove me wrong    
1,i think it s because the romances they got were really uninteresting  finn and rey had a connection but the bromance of finn and poe was right up there with han luke or obi wan anakin from their first scene  i didn t hate rose but she s not as engaging with finn and zorri bliss just felt like they added a character to say poe wasn t gay  i don t think they had to end as a couple but it would ve fit the story better than two shoehorned relationships did 
1,and in tros  when using holdo maneuvers against the planet destroyer star destroyers is suggested  poe says that it s a one in a million tactic  suggesting that repeating it even once would likely result in losses to the alliance without a payoff that suggests that they may have even tried it again to little if any effect  that means it was a battle changing maneuver once  but  it wouldn t work again  therefore  no plot hole changing star wars space battles 
1,i had always gotten the vibe that rey was supposed to be neutral  bringing balance to the force
1,that s the difference between a rushed jj script and a script in development for a lot longer  honestly  almost anything would have been better than what we got 
1,those were kell dragons  but yes  he beat them with his bare hands  to quote vader  katarn is very     resourceful       montage of katarn blowing shit up  to the sound of motley crue s kickstart my heart  
1,oh my we are still going on about this 
1,yup  and that s  barely more than  you having said nothing at all 
1,hate to shit on your post  but that still would have sucked ass 
1,i would loved to have seen her embrace both sides  theres alot of fun jedi games  academy  that let you dive into both sides of the force to access lightning and healing mind trick if you wanted and i always wanted to see that portrayed in star wars media more or whether it was possible at all also having finn as a major character with his own arc would have been amazing  i was so god damn disappointed with how he got sidelined after killing phantasma  he had so much potential with his ex stormtrooper status 
1,  
1,they should sticky that onto the main page   because that s pretty cool
1,redeemed ben solo was probably the best part of tros for most people  i just personally hate how they had to add in the romance because i think it hurt  both  of the characters 
1,don t write a story without knowing how it will end    besides of that i miss the feel the prequels gave me   the prequels were a finde addition to our collection    d   watching and knowing the prequels made the original trilogy kinda better    while the new trilogy kind of just ruined luke skywalker for me    even clone wars  rebels and mandalorian aren t better or worse with the new trilogy    while the spin off  prequels and original trilogy without the new trilogy give nice additions to each other   my opinion
1, deleted 
1,i m 36  watched it twice  really hope they continue the story  clone wars is amazing as well  the animation is stunning and really gives depth to anakin s story
1,yeah  this arc is leading to something 
1,yeah cuz anakin definitely had absolutely nothing to do with the fall of the jedi order  right 
1, gt and i provided evidence of other bloodlines  i m not sure why you re asking for evidence and then ignoring it  but here we are you said palpatine  to which i said that was only made a bloodline in tros  you then said maul and his brother  to which i pointed out that savage only got his powers after the witches did magic on him  and you then said the mortis family  which is a real stretch considering they are the embodiment of the force as a whole and are timeless  if you think those are strong supports to your argument and that they are the only examples you have  then it s quite clear that you were wrong just face it  man  gt and yet we have a film with a theme that says you don t have to come from a particular bloodline to be special    gt    gt amazing film in saying something that was always the case shocker 
1,she saved him 
1,it sucks but it s the case  i always feel like i have to say  i am a fan of the st  sorry about that  irritating  but  it happened with the pt too  or liking ewoks 
1,well it s not like they changed the characters all too much from their originals merely the stories no longer effect the general canon  so the thrawn trilogy is still a good story that elaborates the character  if you re capable of it  i d recommend still reading all the books in the eu per your preference and just separate the legends stuff from the general  the way  star wars theory  does 
1,agreed  i think some of the fun stuff we ll get from the currently announced disney   shows  ahsoka  mando season 3  rangers  etc   will help realllly flesh out the universe and do a better job explaining the jump from 6 7  i think we ll ultimately end up with a more compelling and well understood universe and progression of events from these series  the one thing that can t be undone is the lack of time for development between 7 and 8 
1,thankfully they seem to have learned this lesson now  better late than never  since kathleen seems to have jon and dave connected to almost every star wars on screen product in the pipeline they may not be actively writing or directing everything  but they seem to be attached as executive producers on almost if not all of it which means that they can make sure that everything fits going forward hopefully 
1,having the rebellion and empire come back again but rebranded as resistance vs first order just strips both of their heritage and impact  while still playing the same tune the ot did  my biggest gripe with the sequels  i nearly facepalmed when the bigger badder death star blew up planets plural instead of just one like  please stop 
1,when i read the script i really liked that  funky shit   i was glad rey was still from an unknown family  i liked  solana  as it introduces a new lineage kylo dying evil seemed justified  he went all in on the dark side in that script por and rey was meh  but set up from tlj and i loved hux being obsessed with the force and jedi artifacts  i especially loved that he  gt  killed himself with a purple lightsaber   lt 
1,pretty sure the rebels would have happily sacrificed a few ships to hyperspace into the death star
1,how did you get the that conclusion  their own hubris caused their downfall  not the prophecy  had they made better choices at any point  it could have been averted and the prophecy could still have come to being 
1,i enjoyed it  it wasn t a new hope rip off  it took scenes from the new hope and altered them with different context and character motivations and i loved to see it  the fight at the end is one of my favourite duels in the films and i feel it set up some great concepts and questions for the future  that unfortunatly were never payed off in a satisfying way  the only part i could see as a direct copy is starkiller base  but that makes sense to be a copy because of kylo sobsession with vader
1,yeah ngl i did cry at the end
1,ye i totally agree with you on that  that s why i was asking to see wether the good story of a new hope can make up for not liking old movies  but thanks   ps  my first star wars movie was phantom menace as well  lucky it still worked for me 
1,yeah  i can see that 
1,indeed it does
1, gt i would have loved a sequel trilogy that redefines what being a jedi should be since the previous iteration failed miserably  they even made it a point in tlj that it failed again  the exact same way this is why tlj is one of my favorite star wars movies  it actually tries to go this direction  and it was so much fun to see luke absolutely drag the previous jedi order for all its failings and teach rey that the light and the jedi are not completely bound together  and to think so is nothing but vain and then they throw all that nonsense out the window for rotj 2  electric emperor bogaloo
1,just some dude on coruscant working an underpaid desk job and trying not to get murdered 
1,for sure think chief would respect the clones  and vice versa  the childhood indoctrination  extremely close familial relationships with the others who went through it    chief would be disgusted by the actual forced compliance of the biochips 
1,because i don t see it as a chase  i see it as a siege  visually  it is a chase   ships are moving  etc  but thematically  it is akin to the siege of a castle  raddus and crait are the castle  crait is just the upper level of the castle  the place the heroes fall back to once the walls have fallen and the enemy get through   rose and finn going off to find the codebreaker is akin to a castle sending messengers out for help 
1,rose agrees with me 
1,no  i suppose that ll be next
1,okay    gt but lucas revealed that despite their monastic regime  jedi were permitted to have sex  gt  jedi knights aren t celibate   the thing that is forbidden is attachments   and possessive relationships  and here s a write up of that interview where you can find that quote  
1,i don t think it s more than a week or so between the destruction of starkiller base and the resistance running away from the first order  kylo s face is still healing  but isn t freshly wounded taking extra time between 7 and 8 by making the beginning of 8 about rey s journey to find luke would do a lot more to show her training or growing in her powers     making that time stretch out to even some period of years would allow us as the audience to at least assume she s training  sort of like we assume luke has been training in the gaps between 4   5   6 or anakin in 1   2   3 
1,except the skywalkers aren t an anomaly if you look at darth maul and his brother and apparently two canon jedi siblings called tiplar and tiplee source  and apparently stass allie and cousin adi galliasource  
1,the point is it wasn t really possible  holdo pulled off the statistical equivalent of successfully navigating a few dozen asteroid belts in a row  granted this is undersold in the film itself  if we want to talk broken hyperspace lore  let s talk about finn and rose getting  literally across the galaxy and back  within a few hours  what really did this a disservice was the mention in tros of  pull some holdo maneuvers   like it was just something they could start doing all of a sudden 
1, gt the story is what i laid out above no it s not  that s barely even vague character motivations  let alone a character arc gt i don t really care what the plot is  so long as it achieves the goal of making the characters undergo interesting a difficult character struggles well that s just dumb  you need interesting events to put your characters in to have growth and interesting moments  tlj left us with nothing  gt the problem with tros as written is that it has lots of plot but little story agreed  honestly  i m not here to say ros is a good movie  not sure that s possible lol  but i think a lot of it s problems come from tlj giving it no plot to work with  the rebels are no more  kylo is still in the exact place he started  but with an army  i guess  and rey is a bit better jedi  even the ideas explored between rey and kylo  which is the only part of the movie i actually think is good  for reference  are largely thrown out for the status quo post crait  in fact  i think the movie would have been better cutting out crait and leaving us with rey and kylo ruling together  now you have a set up as the rebels get away to start over  this time with finn and poe leading while out of their depth  and rey and kylo get a chance to explore the doomed to fail grey path as rey fights to keep their new rule on the light side  especially when coming up to opposition from finn and poe and kylo has to confront that his anger and such is the cause to his life going to shit of course  you do have some trouble if you re ever going to redeem kylo in any way  which was 100  the way his arc was going the whole time  he didn t really want to go dark side  but embraced it after luke tried to kill him  without something to bring him back  i don t think his arc would ever be satisfying or interesting 
1,your attempt highlights how the sequels really would have fit in better as episodes x  xi  and xii 
1,failure 
1,wonderfully put 
1,this is why i fucking hate this sub and star wars discussion  not having a bunch of random call backs or half baked ideas like  being human  is not the problem with the sequels 
1,there are a lot  some common ones anh  a new hope first star wars film esb  empire strikes backrotj  return of the jeditpm  the phantom menanceaotc  attack of the clonesrots  revenge of the sithtfa  the force awakenstlj  the last jeditros  the rise of skywalker
1,more colossal failure 
1,that interpretation still feels like it heavily undermines the original trilogy  it makes them feel like some happenstance adventures during the galactic civil war with a couple big victories rather than the central story of the saga and where the destruction of the emperor death star ii is the focal accomplishment  like it makes the celebration following feel about as minimal as the yavin iv celebration in new hope  rogue one feels like a false equivalency because it s a  tangential and supplementary story with the sole purpose of serving the plot and mythology of the cornerstone of the franchise that is a new hope  and maybe that s kind of my problem with the sequel trilogy it mutates and molds and minimizes the original trilogy into something that serves  its  story rather than telling its own 
1,which canon 
1,the proximity to gamergate silliness arcs was the reason for this particular explosion 
1,did poe not say it was a one in a million shot 
1,i m not to into rebels  but the good episodes are  really good  
1,no i mean i just think it would have been a good plotline  i m certainly not upset that we didn t see it  but it would have been cool  there s no problem with it being a platonic relationship  and i don t see one with it being a romantic one either 
1,in all honesty  i don t see how you could start anyone with  the phantom menace  without additional context and expect them to watch  at least  8 more movies   it s one of the worst movies in the canon  and is a way to make her dislike star wars from the beginning    a new hope  may be the oldest movie in the series  but it has staying power     episode iv launched a multi billion dollar franchise for a reason   
1,i think ep 9 was great  but ep 7 was only decent and ep 8 was a complete disaster   to me  the real issue was completely dumping the legends timeline in favor of something new that they had to know would split the fan base   i think they would have been better served taking the basic legends timeline  and characters  and doing some editing   the vong invasion and rogue wraith squadron books would be amazing as animated shows   the story for ep7 9 should have been the legacy series   the jacen jaina story is 100x better then the kylo rey story 
1,well  no  actually   story by george lucas   yes  but he  leigh brackett  lawrence kasdan all had a hand in screenplay writing 
1,i mean  it fucking destroys your ships if you re the rebel alliance and you re always trying to scrounge for all the resources you can  why the heck would you launch your ships at the enemy when another tactic would work like  yeah  maybe they could ve tried launching ships at the death star  but they didn t need to because they had a plan to destroy it that  didn t  involve purposefully blowing up half their fleet 
1,rose    
1,and then c 3po and r2 cameo in the background with 3po saying  i ve always hated space travel   roll credits 
1,i thought we were moving to something a little bit new after tfa  the set up seemed so   the empire is gone  the republic is gone and now the fractured resistance and first order are barely filling the power vacuum   it leaves a lot of places to go from there  but  jeez  as much as people complain about tfa riffing anh  tlj just beat you over the head with  it s empire vs  rebellion again and always will be  alright  luke is even going to explicitly say it  
1,i m not sure what you mean  can you elaborate 
1,that still sounds shitty 
1,you make me want to rip my face off  palpatine was such a shit show  they fucked that whole scene up 
1,oooh  so to be clear disney has given the legends title to content they don t approve of or plan to change  i just started reading the thrawn triology and this makes me not want to finish it   
1, gt is the new trilogy canon  are there going to be comics and novels that will attempt to make sense of the narrative mess that the sequels brought about yes they are canon 
1, gt  you re repeating yourself now and i provided evidence of other bloodlines  i m not sure why you re asking for evidence and then ignoring it  but here we are  gt  there was never a theme in star wars that you had to be from a force sensitive family to be force sensitive and yet we have a film with a theme that says you don t have to come from a particular bloodline to be special amazing 
1,per george lucas  luke skywalker is the most powerful jedi ever  and fitting that  at the end of rotj  the empire and the sith were defeated   luke would be able to bring back the jedi order and the rebellion would be able to establish police a new republic   happy ending what the sequels should have shown us was a grand master luke skywalker with all the things that blossomed off that happy ending   perhaps dealing with imperial remnants   instead  we got the disjointed shit we got  complete with a mary sue jedi who can do anything and be an expert at it mando  however  feels like a better sequel story   taking place a few years ago rotj  it shows the transition to the new republic  it shows imperial remnants  and even allows us to see someone in their prime one episode of mando was better written and executed than an entire sequel trilogy if i was to introduce star wars to someone new  i d show them ep1 3  solo  r1  ep4 6  and end with mando   let them look back on tcw and rebels if they liked what i showed them   no need for a st to ruin the happy ending for no reason other than corporate greed 
1,that is not true  the jedi order had to eliminated as well in order for there to be true balance in the force  that was at least until the sequel trilogy came along 
1,oh for sure 
1,i think duel of fates had some flaws in the early drafts  but it could be worked out with some revisions  i don t think it would have ben perfect but it would have been lightyears better than tros 
1,im still traumatized that we didnt get duel of the fates or at least something close to it  they really shouldnt have frankensteined carrie fisher s performance and force her into the movie
1,poe and finn s bromance seemed stemmed from two soldiers having shared experiences while simultaneously having their own experiences from opposing sides of conflict   this sort of thing actually happened during the christmas truce of wwi  vets tend to have really weird bromances that blurr into a homoerotic type closeness that a lot of those who are not vets see as more of a romantic style relationship   i could see finn and poe together though  but to me their relationship is that of two soldiers
1,a good idea as well  sounds about right 
1,remember the kid with the broom   i d be the broom 
1,anything would have been better  anything
1,vader has a temper too  failing him is usually the last thing one does 
1,well i have yet to meet oneyeah they get shit on and its ironic cause they were some of the best parts of the prequels
1,i mean  it s already established that midichlorian count is a factor  tos made palps a lineage in contradiction to everything established by lucas previously  that the skywalkers were the anomaly and an entire order of space wizards can be maintained by training lucky few random people that happen to show ability 
1,eh    anakin is different in that regard  you re supposed to hate vader  he s an unstoppable  unflinching monster  throwing the old guy down a hole is the first good thing he s done in decades  and it kills him in the process not  trying to defend him   just pointing out the difference in writing and characterization 
1,no problem
1,check again
1, looks at the mandalorian 
1,okay thanks   
1, deleted 
1, gt jedi     force sensitives i never said otherwise    gt i should have been more specific  leia isn t a jedi  she s a force sensitive  it s clearly bloodline related  because the entire series is based around their bloodline  yes  well done  the skywalker bloodline  we ve established that skywalkers are a bloodline  the onus put on you was to provide evidence of other bloodlines that you claim are so commonplace in star wars  i m still waiting  gt maul has a force sensitive brother you re repeating yourself now  and again  he only got his powers after the witches did magic on him  gt there s a  thing  there  tlj s theme is a pretty clear statement that you  don t  need a force sensitive lineage to be special jesus christ  it s like talking to a wall    there was never a theme in star wars that you had to be from a force sensitive family to be force sensitive    literally never 
1,but the idea is absent of the entire prequel context  the prequel went out of its way to shut down the idea that anakin was overpowered 
1,i agree  but not so much on the fact that luke  resolves  to destroy his nephew or the darkness within him  he makes a impulsive decision to ignite his blade before immediately realizing his mistake  but by then it s too late luke still makes the decisions he does after out of caring and selflessness  he exiles himself from the galaxy not because he stops caring  but because he truly believes the galaxy is better off without him  he feels that with one mistake  he isn t the legend everyone believed him to be  and to stick around would only cause more anguish  and so  like luke always has  he puts everyone else before himself  and leaves the problem with that heroic notion of  everyone above me  is that it can easily spiral into depression  and it does  it s not until rey hunts him down and tries to beat back into his skull that nobody other than kylo blames him  leia  the resistance  the entire galaxy stills thinks he s a goddamn legend  and never stopped being one  it takes rey  and yoda  to pull luke out of his own head and gets him to look his mistake in the eye and say that he s more powerful than it overall  luke s teachings were on point   to say that if the jedi die  the light dies is vanity  is an incredible bit of new jedi wisdom  luke s order failed for a far more personal reason than the systemic corruption of the republic jedi 
1,okay thats true indeed  thanks   
1,oh i thought she has signed on for all the movies  so this is like any normal thing lol  pick a good one
1,no they re not
1,how can you be on the council and not have the rank of master 
1,i definitely waited months after it came out to go see it because tlj left a bad taste in my mouth  once i saw it i regretted waiting so long because it was good and fun  it certainly wasn t perfect but it was great compared to tlj 
1,welcome to 2017  dude 
1,i loved tlj  but i agree  the books should add to the movies  not rewrite them 
1,you said it best  its terrible in almost every way with a few ideas that had potential  i think the sequel haters just cling onto anything  and i m not saying sequels were great  but goddamn some people are stubborn about hating them 
1,he has too many attachments to the light  despite choosing the darkness  being in the middle of the road is a good way to get run over 
1,okay thanks i will do that  if she likes the movies we will watch the spin offs yes 
1,thanks  that s usually my goal    
1,true that is 
1,yeah  there s a difference between tweaking some details to refine the story  and completely rewriting the whole script from the ground up  which was ultimately happened  the foundation of a great story was there in duel of the fates  enough to make the st worth talking about in star wars conversations  but of course there was still work to be done on it before it would ve been ready to film 
1,if they went with something dark and gritty like rogue one and the mandalorian  that would have been a good start focusing once again on the skywalker saga is a big mistake they made biggest shame is what they did to luke s character  he was the new hope in the original trilogy but turned into a old grumpy guy for no real reason only a few years later  well it was explained in like 5 min i gave tfa a pass but lost all hope by tlj 
1,i don t have a particular problem with the trilogy as i don t like any star wars movies so for me it s all the same  i like star wars lore a lot  though   however  it was kinda jarring to see that the new trilogy was just a rehash of the old ones  same enemies  same plot  same everything is the new trilogy canon  are there going to be comics and novels that will attempt to make sense of the narrative mess that the sequels brought about 
1, 
1,1  tfa set the sequel trilogy up  and put everything in place for the story to move forward from there2  rian johnson threw a monkey wrench into the story that no one had planned for3  the sequal trilogy was unable to recover  and we were left tros  which  i guess  is the best they could manage in the wake of tlj they had no plan  or whatever plan they had went up in smoke when they approved tlj 
1,lol  i like star wars  but i don t understand the abbreviations 
1,totally understand  i m getting hammered on all sides for stating the clear theme of tlj  so i m a bit frosty   i also should ve clarified that there s a difference between force sensitive and jedi as people are demanding i show them jedi family trees appreciate the chat 
1,it s literally done again in tros  lol  and even if it wasn t  poe saying that is not a retcon  if anything it goes to show why this was the first time we  as the viewers watching this point of the galaxies history  are seeing it done 
1,i want the timeline where favreau and filoni got to write it
1,yeah  that sounds questionable  i haven t actually read the duel of the fates script  so i was replying more from the point of view that romances aren t always bad  i should read more about it  i had thought that trilogy was going to move towards grey jedi  and i was really disappointed when it didn t the best thing to come out of that awful trilogy was that disney hit the reset button  which led to the mandalorian  i didn t know how much i would love seeing a light saber  after a season and half without seeing one 
1,i mean  they also had awful scripts 
1,how was tlj inconsistent with tfa 
1,what i think many people forget  is that during that torture scene  rey looked into kylo s mind and saw something there  that i think was that glimmer of good  and the conflict that raged within him  i think she got a glimpse of ben solo  and felt drawn to that 
1,im sorry but the script for that was horrendous  random  and worse than tros easily  concept art was outstanding but it blows my mind that people read that and thought  wow this is great  
1,he didn t  there have been palpatine concept arts dating back to october 2017  before tlj came out 
1,first off  i m not sure how you can assume that based off of a quick scene with very little dialogue secondly  and more importantly  i m talking about the story of episodes 1 6  not the sequels  not the mandalorian  not the eu 
1,vader was actually pretty unhinged on a  good  day  because he never slept due to his skin grafts and armor being so uncomfortable  it s why he was so quick to choke officers to death  he had zero patience for failure vader just commanded more respect  as he was under an emperor  while ben is under    andy serkis with a scar   
1,i guess they could have played it off as her family coming from alderaan since it sounds fairly similar to organa  but it wouldn t really add anything and as you said  it does just sound like someone slapped solo and organa together 
1,weak might not be the appropriate word  he wasn t intimidating at all and didn t really command respect from the audience  at least not as a villain 
1,caedus
1,your answer does make sense 
1,chosen by whom 
1,oh  for sure  that s part of why rey was able to beat him tfa  his conflict after killing han i don t think we really see him at or near his full potential until maybe the end of tros when he s turned his back on the dark 
1,you can worship the ground george lucas walks on all you want  doesn t change the fact that there is canon outside of the movies and that canon runs counter to his original vision for the universe  like it or hate it  it exists  so deal 
1, gt  their whole species has links to the force in some ways but nothing special which suggests a genetic component to force sensitiveness  doesn t mean it s  all  there is  but certainly suggests that  gt  palpatine was hardly a lineage tros literally made it a lineage  the fact that he could clone force powers shows there s a genetic aspect i mean    he literally cloned force powers 
1,you simply create a new villain  not sure i understand what you mean
1,personally  i hate the st but i like what you bring up here  they didn t have a very clear story and it contradicts so much of the ot  they also wasted so much potential for characters  i really wish they would have had more collaboration between rian johnson and jj  i also wish they had thought out their story more and come up with something more original  i think you had some great points here however
1,but it makes perfect sense if you watch them original then prequel  the clone wars is just not the same  i m baffled that you re even arguing it  there is a reason starwars com has a chronological order of the episodes
1,we ve been together for four years  and no she doesn t want anything in return  she just wants to see if she likes it and if she doesn t we don t go on 
1,did you watch  the clone wars  
1,much like sand  it s coarse and rough and it gets everywhere 
1,i think they re worth watching in the original release order  however  you mentioned she doesn t like old movies  try watching a new hope and then asking for her thoughts  if she thinks the movie is too old to get into but likes the general concept of star wars  swap over to the prequel trilogy and see what she thinks of the phantom menace  just my thoughts 
1,the mandalorian and other shows are tying directly into the sequels 
1,yeah exactly  qui gon was the ideal jedi  not some in between gray jedi  qui gon knew that love was important for jedi  but also knew attachment without the ability to let go of that attachment is what leads to the dark side  the order wanted to suppress all emotion  and i think that detachment from life is what allowed darth sidious to cloud their judgement and diminished their ability to use the force 
1, someone  needs to kiss finn  my guy deserves a kiss 
1,if she wanted to see why you enjoy your hobby  she ll sit through old movies with you  she took the time out of her day to do that  i d go with 4 5 6 1 2 3 7 8 9
1,luke followed the will of the force to help bring anikan back to the light to carry out the prophesy
1,cloners  and dam good ones to 
1,keep in mind with those suggested titles  anything that has a  legends  banner atop the book means that it was before the disney purchase and is no longer canon 
1,  
1,i wouldn t call changing clothes right before it is about to rain  undoing   i mean  tfa pretty explicitly says why luke was there  one of his students turned against him  luke felt responsible  he left 
1,the chosen one prophecy released by a disney era source only describes anakin  not rey or anyone else  in multiple canon works they also affirm anakin did achieve balance nothing ever said that balance was eternal  both from an out of universe perspective of wanting to use darksiders after rotj and an in universe perspective that the sith order isn t the only darksiders around it never was going to be  the long term significance of anakins actions is it helped get things back on track by lethally weakening the sith and helped keep the jedi order alive to fight for balance in the future  and lucas planned to have the sith and darkside survive after rotj anyways  and he s the one who insistently gave anakins actions in rotj their cosmic significance 
1,using those things with the force is inherently corrupting 
1,i ve always seen it similarly  the rule of 2 is a social structure of the sith religion and has nothing to do with the use of the dark side itself  the jedi order and it s social structure is similarly not actually connected to the force and it s manifestations  i think it was especially reinforced in rebels with all of the direct interactions with other beings  avatars  other religions  etc of the force
1,jedi     force sensitives i should have been more specific  leia isn t a jedi  she s a force sensitive  it s clearly bloodline related  because the entire series is based around their bloodline  maul has a force sensitive brother there s a  thing  there  tlj s theme is a pretty clear statement that you  don t  need a force sensitive lineage to be special 
1,and she s a white british brunette 
1,i am sure that they are planning to explore the sequel time period in a few years once the  dust  has settled  and for now they will use the post ot shows to set stuff up for the sequels  the rise and fall of luke s order  the birth of the first order etc  dave and jon could probably lift a lot of elements from the dotf script for a post sequels series if they wanted to  you could have finn work to rehab stormtroopers and fight off first order remnants  we could see poe grow into his role as a leader in the new republic  or whatever replaces it   and we could get to see rey grow into her role as a jedi maybe  nerf  her at the start of the show  working off the idea of it being a clone wars style show  and we can spend the first season with her finally finishing her own training  maybe explain it as her connection to the force being damaged  ala cal from fallen order  after ben died and she has to heal her own connection to the force and balance herself and thus finally learn the stuff that she used to just subconsciously lift from ben s training through the bond  as i understood how a dyad works   then in season 2 she can start training other force sensitives hell  you could do episodes set in force purgatory  or something like that  so we can see ben find peace with his own family and his actions if they wanted to explore stuff like that i m certain we ll see content set in the post sequels time period  they d be silly not to explore what is more or less a blank slate for content in the timeline 
1,there s too many stupid ideas in tlj that were unnecessary and baseless  a quick example  luke using anakin s lightsaber during the force projection rather than his own green one 
1,jedi are a genetic thing  to use harry potter lingo  you can still get muggleborns  which i suppose is due to recessive genes  but force dynasties are a thing  even if the jedi try to avoid relationships  we see it in a ton of eu material  we see it with rey palpatine  we see it with the nightsister brothers we see it with grogu s blood being an important plot point in the mandolorian  and obviously we see it with skywalker dynasty 
1,he wasn t grey at all  he simply didnt agree with the rules of the jedi order  and was right about it 
1,i agree that it s corny as hell  but i actually kind of like it  star wars has always been corny  and i think that s part of its charm 
1,he was  but now we have rey  and rey is better than anakin 
1,the holdo maneuver was only ever done once  they retcon it by saying it s a one in a million shot  poe says this in rise of skywalker 
1,maybe
1,to be fair     have you seen book of henry  i m convinced that was the nail in the coffin because god that was unwatchable 
1,savage was a sith version of a roid addict  their whole species has links to the force in some ways but nothing special  or did you miss the whole  deflating sex doll thing  after sidious stuck him the mortis family were basically force gods  and hardly a lineage seeing how there was always only ever the three  without a mother or any chance of further lineage  palpatine was hardly a lineage  as far as we know no one before him had any ability and his kids were literally failed clones he was trying to breed as force users  go science  yay    i ll say it again  the only  lineage  is the skywalkers  and even that is literally because the cosmic force willed a chosen one into existence to defeat the sith 
1,oh yeah that poe and rey shit was weird and out of nowhere  idk what colin was smoking but it wasn t good hux being obsessed with jedi artifacts could have been super interesting 
1,just go from 1 9 itll keep her hooked if you show rogue one too  cause it goes straight into ep  4do you plan to watch the spin off movies too 
1,i m remembering something from years ago  but don t they address this in the prequels  i seem to remember obi having a conversation with someone about jedi relationships  and he essentially says  jedi gotta bang to make more jedi  we just can t put a ring on it   doesn t that imply force users are more likely to pass along force using abilities 
1,okay wait  how long you been together and have you negotiated a watch thru that she wants in return 
1,it s all the same story 
1,star wars is not meant to be ambiguous or complex   it s science fantasy  with concrete good and evil 
1,boom 
1, gt jedi order in the prequels didn t allow marriage and kids  hence no bloodlinelucas had said during production of the prequels that jedi not being allowed to form attachments doesn t mean that they were celebate 
1,anakin vader is the one that actually destroyed the emperor  ignoring the sequels since they werent created yet   luke helped anakin find himself in order to do that but luke threw away his lightsaber and left himself to the mercy of the emperor  without vader  palpatine would have lived 
1,these people need things spelled out to them with alphabet soup  they don t understand things that aren t said verbatim 
1, gt  while i do agree that genetics play a roleso that means what i m saying is relevant  gt  jedi come from non jedi parents  not all force sensitives are jedi  we re using the term interchangeably  which is probably a mistake on my part to not be more specific  gt  you re telling me obi and mace come from famous bloodlines and    famous doesn t   jedi  either again  these discussions of force families go back decades in star wars discussions  it s a thing to the point where rian johnson made a film where the entire central theme rebuts it of course  tros spiked that  but still  it s pretty clear what the theme of tros is hitting at with insisting rey is  nobody  and broom boy s powers 
1,the ghost luke thing is pretty silly too  if force ghosts can just appear whenever they want  why didn t anakin s ghost ever visit kylo and tell him   hey  the voices you ve been hearing aren t me  you re being tricked  i turned away from the dark side in the end  
1,oh  let me just clarify   i never meant to imply that i was saying any of what i said as a counter to what you re saying  i agree with what you re saying and i understand your points   i m just saying that i genuinely didn t understand this argument before and was asking for an explanation  then just giving my thought process as to why i didn t understand it i truly appreciate the responses you ve given   thank you for helping me understand your perspective    
1,i m glad to know i am not the only person who loved tlj  that and mandalorian are my favourite pieces of star wars media 
1,i have to agree with you
1,a mandalorian  they re one of the fiercest non force related warriors in the lore 
1,its fucking unverifed fanfic  its the equivalent of me telling you im actually jj abrams which i am 
1,copy that 
1,x wing or tie fighter pilot would be cool 
1,based on that scene in the mandalorian it seems like the jedi under luke haven t changed 
1,i dunno  i thought parmesan was kind of grating anakin swiss was a cuter ship 
1,is the first order and undoing or a continuation  the mandalorian has made it clear remnants of the empire still exists and have been trying to reorganize  it always came off as a continuation to me the resistance exists due to the new republic just being formed too weak  as a way to prevent the fall into a new empire  that again seems pretty normal to me  similar to the ot sure  but i don t think it undoes anything luke acting different again isn t undoing in the same way tros did  like i said  luke isn t being told he is the kid of obi all of the sudden or anything the sequels basically said he started a jedi order  he trained people   he look leia and hans kid as his own  all of this is a continuationat some point along the way he failed ben  he felt responsible  he knew that ben hated him  he knew that nothing he did would turn ben back to the light because of how much ben did not like him  nowhere does the movie say luke gave up on ben  luke just had to take himself out of the situation because he knew that his involvement would only anger ben more  all of this seems like a reasonable continuation  nothing is  undone   it s just a darker timeline of what happens to luke than a lot would like 
1,they obviously were leaning into what he spoke about regarding plagueis and imortality  and we ve seen that palpatine was conducting sith experiments  not to mention the existence of the world between worlds showing that there are still aspects to the force even jedi don t understand 
1,she has control of the senate and the courts 
1,yeahhhh you re not wrong  leia  nope  luke  nope  lando pops out of hiding and flies around for an hour  that does the job  i m so mad at tros 
1,the pt is about a beloved and talented hero falling from grace  and the perversion of politics and deceit to turn a democratic republic into an oppressive empire because of one man s scheming  along with the genocide of an ancient order of religious peacekeepers 
1,adored tlj  i like the themes they brought up but that whole casino side plot was awful 
1,i am  just not with idiots   
1,using the dark side is not balance   balance is the force in it s natural state  which some people call the  light  side   the dark side is corruption of nature and balance 
1,yeah i agree  sometimes it almost makes me think of proto vulcans from star trek who were overly emotional  the regular vulcans who are logical to a fault  and then the sarek vulcans who understand their emotions and how they are valuable  but place a large emphasis on controlling them  i think that the jedi fell into that trap of overcompensating  and since there s no way to remove sad and angry from human noid  nature  they decided to suppress it entirely  that s why my favorite stories in star wars are about grey jedi  the independent qui gons  splinter groups  and the ashoka loners  because oftentimes they have a far more interesting view of the world around them
1, deleted 
1,may i ask why 
1,idk  i really loved the force awakens personally  but i thought it fell apart at the last jedi  sure the movie had some enjoyable parts  but i think the issue is that it took out luke and snoke  imo sorta ruined lukes character  also the resistance fell apart so much that they could all fit in one ship by the end i really liked how tfa set up rey  but in tlj they continued to set up new threads of the character  she really had no training either i could go on and on about holdo  hyperspace fuel rose tikos writing  and how they ruined finns character imo but everybody probably heard that alot i personally think the rise of skywalker was not a good movie  i would put it below attack of the clones  but i don t really blame jj for that  he was basically gave nothing expect kylo ren good character   poe dameron meh han solo   rey bad character development   and finn was good  but got ruined  i thought all of these characters were good out of the force awakens  but something happened in the last jedi that made me not like them as much  not to mention luke  han  snoke were all dead and carrie fisher died as well i have no clue how the rise of skywalker could of lived up to expectations with what it was set up  i think all of these issues would of been fixed if one person directed or at least wrote all 3 of them 
1,  
1,it definitely inhibits him    jedi or sith
1, gt  here is the difference  tfa and tlj were made by the directors writers to be the films they wanted to make  and for the most part  they don t actually undo anything from the movies that came before them literally after seeing luke with white jedi robes in the end of tfa   we see the continuation of the scene in tlj and the first think luke does is go to change clothes to a dirty hobo rag  because white luke didnt fit rian s vision
1,that s where my idea stemmed from too  there is already an association between force sensitivity and the name  skywalker  outside of anakin and fam because of the chiss and the  new  thrawn novels 
1,here s what you do  don t do this at all 
1,i think they ve watch 188 too many youtube videos that distort the intention of the film  they re judging the film on a 2nd hand account  a lot of people who hate tlj haven t seen it since theaters and have put it in their brains to be something it isn t because their viewpoint has been changed 
1,what is the timeline for tlj anyways  rey finds luke at the end of tfa  cool  how soon after starkiller base is destroyed that the rebels start to run away from the first order  how long were they even running  a day  more  what about rey  it seems like at least one day passed when she was with luke  one of my major problems with rey is she is so powerful without really any training and what would have been a great thing to have luke train her it just amounted really to nothing because she was always op just needed a little bit of direction  i just really hate tlj and i kinda liked tros at first but the more i thought about things the more i just wished the sequel trilogy never happened or at least had real planning and a consistent writer for all 3 
1,they didn t really leave much to happen afterwards  how do you create a compelling villain now 
1, releasethetrevorrowcut
1, gt ok  stop there    gt    gt palpatines literally only became a bloodline in tros  gt darth maul and his brotherstarted and ended with them  and savage was never even force sensitive  he got his powers from the witches magic  gt the mortis familyit s a pretty big stretch to include them  gt we don t know a ton about the lineages of other jedi  but star wars has been obsessed about bloodlinesbecause there aren t any  star wars was in no way at all  obsessed with bloodlines   i really don t understand how you can think that  gt to the point that people were speculating rey was a kenobi or skywalker    gt    gt why would people speculate that unless this was a  thing  people thought could be a thing because it literally  could  have been a thing    her lineage was made a mystery  for  fans to speculate on  and the only reason people speculated on kenobi was because he was the only one outside of a skywalker that made sense given his relationship with satine  that s it  gt happy to provide you with discussions about jedi bloodlines and genetics i m not sure how you think these links backs you up  one is asking how there were so many jedi given they aren t aloud a family  which if anything backs up what i said because the answer is force sensitives aren t decided by who your family is   another is talking about the skywalkers  and the last is asking why clones weren t made at this point i m starting to doubt you know what a bloodline is 
1,i disagree again  with the exception of tros  which was very much bad 
1,  
1,don t use maul as an example  his whole race is able to use the force  while i do agree that genetics play a role  most jedi come from non jedi parents  they aren t allowed to have a marriage or kids  you re telling me obi and mace come from famous bloodlines 
1, gt  and the first  amp  final order and surviving palpatine undermines the accomplishment of defeating the empire and palpatine i disagree with this  it really just means that the ot showed the rebellion striking a very decisive blow rather than  the  decisive blow  i mean  i don t feel rogue one suffers from knowing its characters accomplish an important task rather than the most important task  for example 
1,rey and poe is terrible and i hate it so much  but in a timeline where i know the alternative  i would take that hands down any day of the week over everything else we got  it s already a better plot arc than poe got in tros 
1, bring kylo ren to me  it is time to complete his training   here kill this girl you met a few hours ago while i hold her down  that s it that s your training  
1,  
1,sounds like the name of an affordable midsize sedan  the new 2020 chevy solana  test drive one today 
1,broom boy can fuck right off 
1,i m sorry  you re just not equipped for friendly discussion goodbye 
1,go ahead and list some  you can t just make that statement with nothing to back it up 
1,solana  if i m not mistaken  is a combination of  solo  and  organa  and for me it s just a cheesy way to do so  it s also just so damn random  like    why combine the names  what s the reason for it  at least rey skywalker shows that she s abolishing the palpatine name to take on the name of the family palpatine hated  the ultimate destiny of the dark proves to be the light 
1,this is quality discussion right here  enjoy your inevitable deletion 
1,lol it s a different trilogy for a reason man
1,i like how the guy who pulled the trigger on the death star gets personified and is named  the universe of star wars is ridiculous 
1,you are under arrest  my lord 
1,dude the last jedi is trash ok  just move on and stop trying to defend it
1,but one writer 
1,be a prospector on the outer rim
1,the tesseract wasn t really an ex machina  it was created by humans of the future and set back in time to close the loop 
1, gt  literally nothing outside of four related characters gives any hint of force lineagemaul literally has a force sensitive brother palpatine clearly has force lineage  skywalker does  mortis family does  maul family does that s four families off the top of my head that we  know  have force propensities the idea of force being familial goes back a long way in star wars discussions  so this isn t some new thing i made up 
1,also  if what i remember from the new comics  vader s suit  wounds  mechanical nature actually limit his overall power  to sidious  satisfaction  i think sidious definitely wanted a more powerful apprentice  especially to wipe out the jedi  but he certainly wouldn t want vader to ever be more powerful than himself 
1,poe and finn though   
1,this is the problem  could you do some neat stuff to follow tlj  yes  could you do it in the finale of the trilogy and the final film in the nine film skywalker saga  no  tlj was an act 2 in a trilogy and the penultimate entry in the saga  it failed at being both of those things 
1,it may not necessarily be  since it is likely that revisions would ve happened so this draft probably wouldn t be exactly what we would ve got  but i do recall the notes stating he was an ancient sith teacher that tought sidious things too 
1,i mean tfa was good  but the other two were not 
1,i totally agree  tlj felt like an interesting yet fulfilling continuation of tfa  then tros wrecked everything 
1,he was the representation of luke s story spreading across the galaxy  which would ultimately inspire people to take a stand against the terrifying force of the first order    or lando would just jet around the galaxy and see if anyone has a spare weekend to fight palpatine 
1,  
1,fucking anakin did that and people still defend him just for throwing an elderly man in a hole 
1,it doesn t matter if some of his ideas are stupid  it s his imaginary world  look what happened to the hobbit when a studio demanded extra shit be tracked on to the story 
1,i actually thought  the rise of skywalker  meant rey was gonna do exactly this and i felt like such a clown when i left the theater lmao
1,they killed off most of the characters
1,fair enough
1,i think this movie would have sucked too  and i still wouldn t like the sequel trilogy  but it does make it a coherent story  and it doesn t commit the cardinal sin of bringing back palpatine and negating anakin s sacrifice  so i guess i would have ultimately preferred it 
1,this is the way 
1,would ve been cooler if luke caught the saber in the forest in tfa  would it be a massive plot contrivance  sure  but no more than the falcon being located on jakku  that way you end with rey and luke setting out on an adventure to discover   something   as a plot setup for ep 8 
1,most of the time when i m arguing with people about tlj  they seem to get half the details wrong 
1,that was also a kinda special case since it was qui gon s last request  the council didn t really want him to  though mainly because they weren t going to train anakin   but obi wan said he d do it regardless
1,yeah  i think that d have to be part of it  but without an external aggressor  it d probably feel like  house of cards  republic senate  
1,it doesn t make sense for it to be broom boy  as none of the characters saw him use the force 
1,i wish the didn t even do the kylo character  and used ben as a han solo type but with force abilties and was straight up the good guy  but goes through a shit ton of adversity and self sacrifices to protect his family and friends 
1,looks like the clone wars obi wan without the blue eyes
1,lucas made some harsh changes to his original plans in the wake of backlash  jar jar was far more integral to the trilogy he originally planned  in what capacity we don t know  insert your darth jar jar theories here  
1, gt   but it was still never needed disney and rian johnson disagreed  obviously   because they made an entire film about it  you can disagree with me  but you re also disagreeing with the people who made the actual film  rey being a  nobody  is the entire film  broom boy as the last image is a perfect encapsulation of that theme  he s a literal slave and yet has special powers he s not a skywalker  he s not a palpatine  he s not one of darth maul s long lost brothers or a cousin of the mortis family or whatever he s just a special kid out in the middle of nowhere  he s  nobody  and yet   
1,why not show how hard it is for a new fledgeling republic is to run  you don t even need a non republic enemy  it s just damn hard to keep a group together post revolution 
1,i disagree with the exception of tros  which is so badly paced that almost nobody gets the chance to react to or feel anything  
1, gt   yes   the big   favor   was  i asked if r2 could come with rey  and if bb 8 could stay behind with the resistance   johnson says   originally it was bb 8 who went with rey  which makes sense for the story in a way  but i asked   can you do me this solid and switch the droids     rian johnsonsource     star wars  the last jedi director asked for force awakens ending change   ew com   and here  for context  is the  non existant reunion moment  that very clearly happens in the theatrical cut of the last jedi   luke reunites with r2 d2   youtube   as for jj knowing about episode viii before production  here s an interview with rian johnson in which he talks about his working relationship with jj  gt    he was into it  and i remember that i pitched him the story at the very beginning  and he had notes  but he wasn t like   oh my god  what the hell are you doing     laughs   no  he was into it because i think he was into the storytelling  he s a great storyteller himself and he saw the potential of each one of these beats  i think he saw it for what we were going for  which is not    we weren t going for   let s subvert a    star wars    movie   we were going for  let s make a great    star wars    movie that has things in it that will push the limits of what we can do       rian johnsonsource    what j j  abrams thinks about the last jedi  according to rian johnson   cinemablend   the article also says this interesting tidbit about his creative freedom with tlj  despite the fact that j j  abrams reportedly supported rian johnson s vision  it also seems like abrams gave johnson as much creative freedom as possible to make  star wars  the last jedi  his own  when asked about whether or not abrams provided any character input  johnson explained   gt    no  he was really gracious  in just stepping back and giving us a blank slate to work with  the starting point was      the force awakens      script  which is quite a big  expansive  wonderful starting point  in that way  we are drawing directly from his work  but from that point forward it was a blank canvas    there are a ton of  sources  out there that will say one thing or another to get clicks  and everyone has their own side of the story  don t believe everything you read  jj knew what was going down in tlj before it came out  that s a fact 
1,the issue was always how quickly disney wanted the movies out by  george always said you need a decade to make a trilogy  but disney had paid 4 billion dollars for star wars and they wanted a return on their investment asap  so the sequels were made in almost half that time  2013 2019   that s why they couldn t get a single director for the trilogy  the other movies are in preproduction while the current movie is filming  and why they never took the time to plan out a proper story  there was just no time to do that before tfa needed to film  they  barely  managed to scrape together a coherent film in tfa  and that s only because harrison ford broke his leg during filming and forced them to take a pause where they had time to regroup and reorganize the story  most of the problems with the sequels can be traced back to that decision to release a film in the trilogy every 2 years instead of 3 
1,i agree  never thought about it  but it feels there s nothing else  there are no characters worth carying about  i couldn t give 2 shits about what the characters do afterwards  hard to explain  but i feel you
1,i personally disagree about how you say the other stuff people point out make the sequels bad is actually fine  i e the films being rushed and having no direction  but i agree about that cancelled movie  i saw a glimpse of it somewhere online and thought  this makesway more sense than just throwing palpatine in the mix 
1,if they re the only ones then that just proves it doesn t matter  yoda doesn t come from a bloodline that we know of  kenobi doesn t  ahsoka doesn t  cal kestis doesn t  caleb dume doesn t  ezra bridger doesn t  depa bilaba doesn t  gungi doesn t  aayla secura doesn t  mace windu doesn t  asajj doesn t  maul doesn t  literally nothing outside of four related characters gives any hint of force lineage  and even that is explained as a vergence in the force creating the first of the line as a means to right the imbalance caused by the sith  that this false information was even jumped on shows how little the sequel writers understood and that they blatantly avoided talking to the two people that could have helped  filoni or lucas 
1,out of the many interpretations of prophecy and myth you see in fiction  you d think that bringing balance to an ancient power entwined with all life in the universe would require more than just chucking a scrotum faced old man in a bathrobe down an exhaust shaft 
1,yeah the bad outweigh the good from those leaks imo
1,jj throwing out the trilogy plan because he wanted to focus on the old characters is probably the lynchpin of why the st became a mess  the entire fucking point should have been making a new story with a new cast  to launch sw into a new generation of cinematic films 
1,lol  but everyone loves the vader fan fiction which is the prequel movies  anakin didn t become a real character until the clone wars released 
1,the prophecy says the chosen one will be born of no father 
1,i spent about 1h trying to find a video i saw months ago where a youtuber who has studied writing has made where he changes a few details here and there and makes a bad movie into something that would have been acceptable  unfortunately i couldn t find the video your remarks are valid  the leaked version of jj idea for episode 8 was better than what ruin johnson came up with  i personally have very strong disdain for that particular movie  and the other episode 9 would probably have been better than the mcguffin chase with serveral nonsense we got out of that last movie what i think is that everyone involved tried to make their own vision of star wars  instead of going with all the previous material already written for star wars  including george lucas own notes on the guidelines for the sequel trilogy  was a very bold move  when you take such a big risk you can either succeed big or fail miserable  unfortunately  for me  they only made the latter  mandalorian got me a bit of old star wars taste  but i rewatch the first 6 movies every 2 years or so  and i haven t rewatched those aberrations any time since i saw the last jedi and left the movie completely confused and disgusted  what s worse  after the force awakens  there were several youtubers at the time with really interesting ideas and theories  many of those  would have been great if they had gone with those  but no  expectations must be subverted and it s best to come up with a lazy boring movie  instead of giving fans what they wanted 
1,and as we all know george lucas is word of god and never has stupid ideas 
1,i remember liking the first one that came out when i was a kid  i could play the cantina song on my flute  that was one of my favorite scenes 
1,  
1,yoda doesn t play with me anymore
1,that s what the leak of the movie before it came out said would happen and honestly it sounds corny as hell  not a fan personally 
1, gt the  grey continuum  interpretation of the force entirely misses the point of george s story george s story was a rehash of the cheap serials he watched as a kid  this has grown beyond well beyond that black  amp  white morality 
1,i blame so much cgi    kind of how hobbit world feels so horrible compared to the lotr world
1, gt with all of them dying relatively young after failing to accomplish anything with their lives lol what  changing the literal fate of the known galaxy twice within a generation isn t accomplishing anything edit  sorry  3   timesanakin  luke  kylo
1,his existing redemption is no more last second than anakin s  and i d argue you see much more conflict in ben than vader but dotf had ben go full evil with luke himself saying ben was irredeemable  only for him to apparently do it with his dying moment 
1, deleted 
1,rip mf doom
1,agreed   we didn t need a bad remake  we wanted to know what comes next 
1,no it literally isn t it s  barely more than  nothing  but it s still more than nothing 
1,i d find a job in cloud city and try to stay out of the galaxy s way 
1,  
1,making up something and  leaking it  isn t better than nothing  it s literally made up 
1,righto  the concept is inherently antithetical to the franchise  it s not just  the nickname isn t used in the series  
1,that all sounds great  but given how mediocre  from a filmmaking perspective  not just a sw superfan  the sequels were  i have real doubts they could have pulled something that nuanced off 
1,i don t  like  them  i find them really cheesy but it s also my childhood  there a genuinely good scenes and its creativity lead to really good star wars content like clone wars or even the battlefront games to a certain extent  i would not be able to watch them without cringing a bit tho
1,ehhhh    i mostly agree  but the ot wasn t really about anakins redemption at all until the final movie  neither anh or esb really had any mention of vader being redeemed 
1,1  we re not comparing first luke to first rey  we re comparing jedi luke to nobody rey   and we re ignoring the fact that nobody but a jedi should be skilled in melee combat anyway  because high energy weaponry is extremely prolific  2  again  we re not comparing new han to new rey  we re comparing nobody rey to experienced han  arguing that they made han unbelievably skilled in another of their terrible movies and then retconned it for rey to be more skilled in their terrible anh knockoff only furthers my point  thanks    3  c3po gave us a shaky translation of ewok that he was unsure of  as a droid programmed to understand languages  it was believable that he could do that  rey knows ewok cause    she s special 4  rey is so totally cool and awesome that she convinces luke that he was wrong and he admits how great and cool she was after a whole movie of only talking about how great and cool she is  buy the rey funko pop please for the love of god we are dying here and you guys wonder why all the actors fled the franchise  and dlf hasn t set a new story in the same era  it was a flop  time to get over it 
1,i see  thank you 
1,correct me if i m wrong  but isn t luke the chosen one  everyone thought it was gunna be anakin  but it turns out to be luke    
1,no  but it definitely shaped the script that replaced it 
1,i got the same thing for christmas
1,no kidding   i m excited to see what he picks up for a replacement though  to bad we ll have to wait a year to find out 
1,no because he threw palpatine down the shaft on the death star in return of the jedi  killing him  or so we thought till rise of skywalker  also anakin s spirit helped rey so ig you can make the argument that he brought balance
1,anyone who enjoyed the last jedi needs to see a doctor 
1,i believe he did die  and that prophecy was fulfilled  but since palp was so evil he conspired a way to be brought back to life by his cult followers prolly requiring some of their lives as well  basically creating a new evil  an evil that needs to be stopped and the force new that rey luke finn ben were the only ones left to do it so the force brought them all together
1,the deserter s kids  pretty much any child in that show is really annoying
1,which is more of a criticism of jj than anything 
1,looks that way to me
1,technically yes  however  according to george lucas himself  and 99  of the fanbase  anakin is and will always remain the chosen one  because he was written as such 
1,finn and poe were snubbed so hard as a couple
1,anakin killed palpatine s true body so he technically did
1,i mean  this is a discussion forum  what the precise fuck do you think happens on these i m discussing the issue  are you unaware of star wars discussions and how they work  particularly when people disagree 
1,not a fan of political intrigue  the fall of the old republic rise of palpatine fall of jedi order is a good story on its own even if you ignore the skywalker aspects
1,no  at the end of the movie they show a first order ship above the forest moon of endor  explained at the end of the first paragraph 
1,i honestly don t understand how the jedi aren t the side to promote love  i ve thought about it and compare it to like a super hero situation   where maybe anyone close to them could be targeted   but honestly i feel love should be the backbone to jedis   it seems to always be their bane when they try to outright deny it  i would guess multiple jedi have hidden things because love is one of  if not strongest feelings  then hiding things from a console or fellow jedis could only cause more issues  i really don t get it   also like i know their are cases of jedis having children but its usually to like save a race   i mean if they are strong with the force wouldnt the jedi want them to continue the lineage to make themselves even stronger  makes no sense to just try and bottle it up 
1,i never said they had to be
1,mandolorian  this is the way 
1,based
1, gt it s clear what tlj was saying with broom boy but it s really not  let s just say for a minute that we really don t know for sure that just anyone can potentially be force sensitive  and be trained  etc  the implication of the broom boy is definitely that anyone can be force sensitive  but if we re speculating like you re saying with the other families  then we can also speculate endlessly about whether or not broom boy is some lost missing boy from another strong jedi family  i get what you re saying about the theme  sure  that is part of the theme and as someone else mentioned  it s clear they meant for it to be part of the theme  but it was still never needed  and beyond that  if we want to be speculative as you ve suggested  then it s still not definitively clear enough to matter 
1,and i m not saying that  has  to be the case  but it certainly the impression that star wars have given at times  to the point that rian johnson has an entire film built around the theme to give the opposite impression  people are asking for proof  but the proof is the fact that tlj exists in the form it does  rey is  nobody   that s important  broom boy is a slave of no importance and yet   both are special  both have force powers  not because of their bloodlines or their family name  that s the entire theme of tlj  right there

1,clickbait    who hasnt thought of this   
1,if you watch the behind the scenes  the people making it are super passionate about it  what specifically do you think is so inconsistent with the last jedi vs the other movies 
1,skywalkers does not equal force sensitives  in the prequels the jedi order weren t allowed to have kids  so how the hell are force sensitives a genetic thing   you re mixing up skywalkers being central to the storyline with jedis being a genetic thing 
1,couldn t agree more  individually i like all three movies  as a whole  they don t make any sense  worst yet  they devaluate everything that luke anakin did by bringing palpatine back from the dead i never heard of duel of the fates  but it sounds amazing  thematically i like the idea of transitioning from evil to good to balance  it also makes a lot of sense if you consider that disney was building up to this by using shows such as rebels  i love the idea that they had an actual integral vision for star wars as a whole  and it angers saddens me even more that they chickened out because of the backlash 
1,yea mlm never got it right  i actually prefer the blt more than the sos but lgbt wasn t too bad either 
1,how could so many people be so stupid as to not expect backlash from tlj  a literal child could have told you people would hate that film 
1,the movies are always going to be  simpler  when it comes to the lore than the tv shows  cartoons  comics  books  games etc  as they should  the movies are how star wars most easily reaches out to the  casual  fans  casual movie goers  kids  people that watched star wars as kids but didn t get stuck in it etc if you are angling to draw in casuals you cannot go too deep on things like universal lore that s it is mainly going to be nerds like you and me in here that are interested in  it s is far better if the movies stick to simple  good vs evil  stories and we can explore the lore and universe of star wars more deeply in things like tv  cartoons and comics  of course that doesn t mean that the movies cannot build on the lore or lean on the extended works  but you shouldn t write a movie that requires someone to read a book beforehand about the nature of the force for the movie to make sense  amp  x200b tldr  it s better to keep the movies simpler so that they are more easily accessible to casual new fans  who can then explore the deep lore of star wars in other media if they get hooked 
1,not as good no  but it seems like a lot of the newer fans really like them  so you might too 
1,to which he answers  the tale of darth plagueis the wise  ever heard  have you    
1,lmfao right like every argument they make is countered by watching the movie
1,i just want to say that i agree with you about tlj  that shit was sweet 
1, gt only if you ignore the fact that luke outright admits to having been wrong by the end of the film about believing trying after failure is worthless  nothing to do with his belief of the force   the greatest teacher failure is  says yoda the st movies keep trying to make a point of the balance being literal 
1,a 4chan leak literally is nothing
1,there s always good potential  but in the duel of the fates script  rey uses poe s sudden feelings for her  despite them finally meeting at the end of last jedi  to jedi mind trick him during a kiss so while i really like duel of the fates  ideas overall  that one    not so much 
1,the last five episodes of rebels starting jedi night broke my emotions in ways that few tv shows and movies have been able to 
1, gt tfa and tlj were made by the directors writers to be the films they wanted to make  and for the most part  they don t actually undo anything from the movies that came before them they did undo a lot of stuff though  tfa shows us an already established first order with the resources of building another death star that is several times larger than the last one  how did the first order even emerge  how did the new republic formed at the end of rotj lose grip over things so much that the building of such a super weapon went undetected  who is snoke and where has he been all this time  in one fell swoop the starkiller base destroyed several new republic planets including the capital planet hosnian prime  this pretty much reset the good guys in the sequel trilogy to a small army like they were back in a new hope  tros answered all my questions from tfa in just one lame manner  somehow palpatine was alive and he has been pulling the strings all along  colin trevorrow s script  from what i read in the op  didn t even bother answering these questions  tlj felt like one director s hot take on stories in star wars  the most positive jedi who was a beacon of light and headed into battle to save his friends in the original trilogy is now a hermit who has cut off himself from the force  snoke who was set up in tfa as a villain for the trilogy gets comically murdered  finn who was set up as a unique character who defected from the first order is now just a side quest guy  rey went to luke for training but she got stronger without it by the end of the movie anyways and her parents are revealed to be nobodies  luke dies in the end and the resistance is left as a small group of 400 people  there s nothing left for movie 3 in the trilogy to do other than generic good guys vs bad guys with the good guys coming up on top despite the odds being stacked against them both these movies didn t take anything from the end of the original trilogy for the sake of continuity other than just the og characters themselves  those characters have either not progressed much  han and leia  or are pale imitations of themselves  luke   and the stories the sequel trilogy started to tell was a rehash of previous concepts anyways so they were setting themselves up for failure 
1,says the guy replying to every single comment going against what you say lol
1, gt  stories about force sensitive families    the force being only a genetic trait i m not claiming that s the case  i m saying that star wars has given us the impression that s the case and tros further enforces it  while tlj was directly trying to do the opposite  gt  the prequels and every other piece of sw media shows that being force sensitive doesn t require being from a family that was already force sensitive the prequels does literally no such thing  gt  literally every other force user is not shown to be the son daughter of force sensitive parents   also see  darth maul and his brother  mortis family  palpatine family   
1,to be fair  he had rey dead to rights on the death star wreckage 
1,like i said  i never took any of those bloodlines as contradicting the idea that you didn t have to be a member of said bloodlines to be a force user and to be fair  rey was speculated to be a skywalker because of the narrative of  grandfather children grandchildren    the hints of her being one in tfa 
1,oh yeah certainly  i m not saying dotf would have been worse or better than tros  without having seen dotf it s impossible to say  but going off the ideas itself  i don t think it would have been any better than what we got but who knows    if executed well  it might have even been one of the bests in the saga 
1,i love the idea of a courscant uprising
1,i had no idea about this  sounds interesting  and might have been better than tlj  but not sure if it would ve salvaged the trilogy  i think there s no getting around that there was never an overall story arc planned for the trilogy  there was never a to b  and end up at c  so there s no overall arcs  or seeding of plot points that pay off in meaning ways  the prequels are about anikin s turn to the dark side  the og trilogy was about like rising up to stop his father  the sequel trilogy is about      i guess rey rising up to stop the emperor  but it wasn t setup properly  which is why it didn t work  think about the second films in other trilogies  we get some foreshadowing of anikin s turn  we get a showdown between luke and his father    but in the sequel trilogy  no trace of the emperor  i don t think blame rests solely with rian  it still blows my mind that they never had an outline  and general consensus of where to go with these films 
1,i plan on watching star wars with my friend as soon as we have time to hang out  i heard the newer ones aren t very good 
1,you should watch return of the jedi again then 
1,kennedy isn t a writer man 
1, gt  that the way their teachings had evolved to remove all sense of humanity in an effort to block out the dark side was based on their fear of itwhich is what luke was supposed to learn  then they decided luke forgot that lesson or something and did the exact same shit as the jedi from the prequels and failed at that too 
1,as much as i despise the whole idea of the force being genetic  esb rotj were the first to imply the force is genetic to some degree leia is shown as being force sensitive and obi wan and yoda  somewhat  agree that she is the only other person who can take down the empire if luke fails  of all the force users we see in the ot  3 out of 5 are related 
1,we don t know if and when it happens on screen  you ll know when the internet breaks 
1,the death star has a hyperdrive  therefore a hyperdrive capable of moving something as big as the death star exists  size isn t a problem here you wouldn t even need one that big though  most of the destructive power comes from the velocity  not the mass of the projectile  chances are you might only need an asteroid the size of an x wing  with the hyperdrive from an x wing  going at lightspeed to punch a hole straight through to the reactor and blow it up lightspeed ramming makes episodes 4  6 and rogue one redundant  no need for plans  no need for trench runs  no need to bring down the shields first  just smash something expendable into it really fast and you re done 
1,i totally get that  and i fully understand the issues with twbw  but i think it was done in a way that works without introducing at will time travel into the universe  we  the viewers  always knew that ahsoka survived her duel with vader  so ezra was only completing the loop  if ezra went back to change something that we thought was final   for example  saving qui gon   that would be problematic for sure  but thankfully that didn t happen 
1,i agree 100  
1,or like watching episode vi before episode i   the abject lunacy 
1,the books are absolutely still worth reading  they help set up things for both the st and mando but i feel like you answered your own question as to whether you should or not  you clearly aren t going to enjoy it so focus on something you will 
1,yeah i agree  just disappointing really 
1, gt  there is literally one bloodline in star wars and that is the skywalker ok  stop there palpatines  darth maul and his brother  the mortis family we don t know a ton about the lineages of other jedi  but star wars has been obsessed about bloodlines to the point that people were speculating rey was a kenobi or skywalker why would people speculate that unless this was a  thing  people thought could be a thing  gt  so please  do tell me about these famous jedi bloodlines you claim people have been debating for  decades    happy to provide you with discussions about jedi bloodlines and genetics there are a lot more  i just am not about to spend my morning digging up decades of talks about this 
1,i disagree 
1,stories about force sensitive families    the force being only a genetic trait  the prequels and every other piece of sw media shows that being force sensitive doesn t require being from a family that was already force sensitive  literally every other force user is not shown to be the son daughter of force sensitive parents 
1,anakin 
1,qui gon is as gray as a jedi can go
1,bring back  brung   
1,mate easiest way to watch is just the order they were released  that s the order they re meant to be watched  it s just 4 5 6 1 2 3 7 8 9
1,i appreciate when movies take risks  disney got so scared of tlj s backlash that they went with the safest movie possible and ruined it 
1,i enjoyed them  and they set up a lot of things seen in the mandalorian  plus a few other easter eggs thrown in    also setting up some future storytelling  past the sequel trilogy the story being told in the movies  books  shows  and comics is far from over  and i have a feeling the story group will tie everything together  and we will see why the events of 7  8  and 9 played out how they did 
1,at least tlj set up an interesting story for ix  then jj decided to do a rehash of rotj anyway 
1,which is why i implied with my final paragraph that palps line simply isn t enough to work fully   it gives the beginning of an explanation   it almost feels like kylo should stay silent for a few seconds then ask  and  what abilities are we talking about  you definitely formerly dead but not dead anymore extremely powerful sith lord  
1,if we re just talking about episodes 1 6  leaving the sequels out of it for a moment  i don t see it that way at all there s nothing in rotj to suggest that luke is just going to  continue the jedi as how they were   he s seen the face of their biggest failure and confronted it  the fact that he saw the good in vader and helped him reconcile with his past is  exactly  the fundamental change you re talking about 
1,rey is overpowered to please kennedy s extreme feminism  making mandalorians a  creed  instead of vikings like george created them is bullshit to please left wing extreme diversity  and these are just two examples  you can only enjoy this if you share this ideology 
1,jenny nicholson also thinks tlj is good  so   
1,his trials and knighting is shown in the 2003 clone wars series that is now non canonical 
1,storm trooper
1,while duel of the fates is weird in those ways  i still think it had the potential to deliver a better overall ending  i actually enjoy tros  i like all 9 movies  but let s be real  it s really shitty  i don t really blame tlj for the mess of the trilogy  i think tros not building off tlj is the real issue
1,the idea of hux being obsessed with jedi artifacts could ve been interesting  maybe not in the final film of the trilogy but if it was there all along
1,that one is great  there is another  essay  video that discusses the plot using clips from the other movies and the concept art     
1,anakin and parmesan had a more interesting romance fight me over it
1,good point  it would be rey who achieves that  with minimum effort as well i bet    eye roll  
1,i mean  in the eu legends  one solo kid becomes darth   cialis  i can t remember the exact spelling or name  
1, gt  star wars fans are star wars fans and are very rarely going to be happy interesting  since there s a huge library of content that stays true to the tone  atmosphere  and character of the originals that are all widely enjoyed by die hard fans and casual fans  are you just ignoring the massive success of the mandalorian 
1,lmao  can i ask why  the hutts are cool  i always thought jabba was like the tony suprano of the star wars universe
1,yes  this  i am surprised this doesn t get mentioned as often as an issue with the st  adding a time jump in between the movies helps with the whole mary sue issue with characters and also provides the opportunity to fill in the gap in case you fuck something up  one of the benefits of having a gap between 2 and 3 was we got the clone wars tv show and it really helped flesh out anakin s fall  of course  there are always going to be things that are unfixable  but at least you have some wiggle room to fix things or add more context retroactively  without a time jump  they really boxed themselves into a corner 
1,probably a janitor on the death star 
1,  
1,people are entitled to their opinion  you re allowed yours and i m allowed mine  sorry you didn t get the same enjoyment out of it  hopefully other star wars things like the mandalorian  season 2 was amazing  and the recent conclusion of the clone wars are doing it for you instead friend 
1,those are all really cool points  i had never seen much of the original script leak i personally feel it s not surprising disney got cold feet and scrapped the plan  they do it constantly with their modern films  all of the live action remakes have elements that try to address fan criticisms over the years  even if the criticisms became meme jokes  they are obsessed with catering to every fan whim  or perceived one   they have no backbone as a studio making content they believe in  even look at marvel  everyone is excited about the next spiderman being more than likely multiverse  and that s disney reacting to into the spider verse being such a huge hit for sony  disney literally made their last spiderman film a fakeout on multiverse because they weren t going to do it and now they ve done a 180 because they assume data shows fans want it 
1,agreed  attempting to disabuse the sw status quo of the idea that the force belonged to elite bloodlines is  one of the reasons i liked tlj 
1,i m not talking about that scene though   i am refering to when he enters the ruins and finds han s dice  he looks up at rey almost pleading and rey closes the door on him  next shot is litteraly him  alone  kneeling in the ruins  having lost everything he wanted  mainly rey s support and his chance at closure  and before that  we get a close up on a rather pissed general hux  before tros decided to expedite the implications by making him a spy and ejecting him from the narrative  implying that even the brass of the first order won t take his ascension well   to me  kylo at the end of tlj reads like someone who s got nothing  no reason to be a good guy  sure  but no reason to remain bad either  all he got from following the dark side is losing things  that s a solid foundation for a redemption  neither path has been good for him so far so he s free to try again either one 
1, gt  it s the focus of all the luke and snoke scenes in tljonly if you ignore the fact that luke outright admits to having been wrong by the end of the film 
1,if you just go from the movies  kylo is an irredeemable bastard who murdered a school of jedi  any time you bring that aspect of him up though  there s always someone who jumps to the defense of  well  in the books he wasn t so bad   i just hate that they mishandled this trilogy so badly that they have to fill in the blanks through supplemental material 
1,no  she certainly does  at 2 36 in  this video  
1,canon is mostly disney s shows  movies  comics and books  legends  eu  is all the books  comics  games from before disney bought lucasfilm which is now not considered part of canon 
1,i had forgot that    still like the gonzo idea though lol
1,well obi wan had anakin as a padawan immediately after becoming a knight
1,dissen gonna be bery messy  meesa no watching
1,there is a difference between foreshadowing events and just shock porn  if you don t believe me look at the difference between goliath season 1 and season 2  alfred hitchcock is a curse and gift to the industry  his ability to shock people with twists was amazing but now we are in constant competition to keep that alive and it ruins everything now 
1,the writing style doesn t improve and is some of the least enjoyable writing i ve ever read   definitely would recommend the thrawn books instead   and just read the wiki for the origins of the fo instead of wasting your time with aftermath 
1,for personal reasons  a hutt
1,storm trooper
1, gt  it s a pretty boring plot about anakin getting in the vader costume  ah i see you don t have an actual point  you re just a moron nevermind  forget i asked 
1,worst to happen was getting jj abrams the man copied a new hope  did not advance the universe  no jedi order  the new republic is garbage and so are the army  it is like the efforts of the rebels didn t matter  the og trio never had a scene together 
1,the ot had three different directors
1, as someone that loved the sequel movies  see  there s your problem 
1,lack of consistencynot enough creativityweak unimaginative plot undermines the previous films uninteresting characters
1,great post  this definitely is something the sequels lack which further damages the sequels as a whole  so in tfa you have some great interactions between poe and finn  then later on the same between finn and ray  clearly jj was setting up a good foundation for these characters to have a friendship similar to the ot crew  the actors chemistry was great on screen but two flaws in the story hurt the future growth of their characters bonds 1  poe does not meet ray  these two have zero development together 2  tfa s ending  it ends with a clear intention of picking up with tlj the moment it ends  in esb you get the indication that time has passed  that theses characters have grown since we last saw them and that their friendship has too then we pick back up with tlj  which doesn t help the issue at all  it only does further damage  in two ways 1  it splits them up  each of the characters goes off on a side mission alone which is great for character development individually but not as a group  2  poe doesn t meet ray until the end of tlj  these two have zero relationship building after two movies finally we have ros  the one thing this movie did correctly was try and show bonds between these characters on screen  but the problem was that most of the relationships building happened off screen  in the ot we see a lot of banter and things that make you believe they are friends  it allows for the viewer to have the perception of off screen development  when we pick up in ros ray has only just met poe as far as the viewer is concerned  i honestly enjoyed these characters but they will never be as developed as they should as a group 
1,because he s not like vader and that s the point vader is calm  focused  and always in control kylo is volatile  emotional  and conflicted  he  wants  to be a supremely powerful figure like vader  but just can t  so  despite being capable of quite a lot  his conflicted and emotional behavior makes people see him as weak 
1,you should see a doctor  then 
1,thank you  beautiful thing about the movies is that they mean different things to different people and they breed so much discussion 
1,i ve never really understood the need for  broom boy   the force has always been accessible to everyone  but stronger in some more than others  aka jedi sith   i mean  the only reason the jedi and sith are such an  exclusive  group is because that s the story after ep3  there are barely any left  and yeah  most of their names are skywalker because  again  that s where the story took us broom boy as a specific force user  cool  broom boy as a symbol that anyone could use the force  nonsensical 
1,you know  i mostly liked the sequel trilogy too  i enjoyed rey as a character  i was excited for my little nieces to see a strong female jedi  they love her i also like finn and poe  some great lightsaber duels  and awesome star fighter scenes  but there s still three things that i really don t like about them 1  i am still disappointed in how luke s future turned out  not what i expected or hoped for him 2  palp s return was seemingly random  it would have been okay if not for   3  the ending of ix  was too similar to marvel s endgame  the ships all jumping in mirrored dr  strange and his portals  and then the whole  i am     lines to end both films  it was great in endgame but fell flat in ros 
1,it s during the duel with kylo on starkiller base  she paces around him like a tiger at 2 36 in  this video  
1, gt  op literally says  i don t care about what s faithful to star wars  in a comment okay  it s not like he was elected spokesman for all people who enjoy the st  plenty of people who don t like the st don t care about star wars canon either  gt  it s fine if that doesn t matter to youand here s where we re back into the bullshit gate keeping  saying that liking the st means the star wars canon doesn t matter to them is just being elitist  it s the same nonsense that people were saying 20 years ago about the prequels   it was dumb then  and it s dumb now 
1,people secretly want fan service even when they say they dont 
1,ben s last second redemption     like what happened in episode ix 
1,i m with you  i hate stuff that undermines the original movies  i can t stand how people are okay with tinkering either  the sequels completely negate luke and anakin s story and are not good movies as far as i m concerned like what s the point of vader s story if the emperor was just hanging around the whole time alive  god i hate jj so much sometimes 
1,storm trooper
1,i think it depends very much on the terrain and purpose of the vehicle  clone war equipment was designed to provide the most amount of impact against a larger army  walkers were far more designed to project fear  but sacrificed speed repulsors mean more power consumption  and if the power fails the vehicle is done  so  wheels would allow for a more energy efficient transport on the battlefield 
1,that ll be sick
1,the game has been out for several years at this point  the servers aren t gonna close  for many more years to come  so if you really love the game  you can keep on playing it  in all honesty  though  i think we ve gotten our money s worth out of it  ea shouldn t be obligated to give free content anymore  time to move onto battlefront 3 
1,lol  look at you pretending like i m obsessing about something or have somehow lost something you re projecting  my dude best of luck in life 
1,the st story was all over the place  it hardly makes sense if you put all 3 movies into perspective  revenge of the sith is also one of the best star wars movies so at least the prequels gave us that as well as a multitude of interesting characters that were expanded in  you think disney is going to expand on the characters that were is the st 
1,why do we feel we need to apologize for liking tlj  or preempt a barrage of ugly comments by merely stating our opinion 
1,the ot is literally about how luke needs to step into his father s shoes and save the galaxy  the force has always been genetic  you know   i m a jedi like my father before me     the force is strong in my family  i have it  my father has it   my sister has it  the pt doubled down on this with the idea of midichlorians  and force literally being linked to specific bloodlines in a scientific sense  you couldn t be more wrong 
1,but then he is good at the end so uh  yeah it is okay this is my problem  people want to see rey go for adam driver  not kylo ren  kylo was a prick through and through  and one moment of redemption at the end does not make it a good romance  rey should have told him how much she respected him for making the right call at the end  but not fallen for him romantically  would have loved to see a male female relationship that isn t romantic
1,no she didn t  she died when rogue one was out 
1,i m 100  fine with all of this except rey and poe  that just feels shoehorned 
1,that s not really an answer  baloney is better than no baloney which is my point  i ve not seen anything  baloney or better  claiming what op said so i asked where they saw it pointing out that where they might have seen it is probably bullshit doesn t really do or contribute anything 
1,i think we neeed bear in mind what we ve seen is first draft stuff  there could certainly have been improvements
1,the last jedi would ve been vastly more entertaining if rey had left with kylo at the end  one of them gets a redemption arc in the last movie  etc  i also really disliked how the emperor became the big bad once again with 0 previous setup 
1, gt  failing to accomplish anything except  oh you know  defeating palpatine and the empirejust wait  in star wars episode 10  someone s going to have this line   somehow  palpatine has returned  
1,or palpatine or the darth maul family or the mortis family   it s why people heavily speculated rey could be a kenobi or a skywalker and it s why johnson specifically put broom boy there   to hit back at that idea 
1,facts  about luke  han and leia  there all just fucking incompetent all of a sudden 
1,the twilight  the one that s falling apart  the ship that caught on fire when obi wan landed it   that twilight   anakin 
1,at least we get to see cgi space leia
1,i thought sam jackson just liked purple
1,where is grogu 
1,my biggest gripe with the st was how similar it was  to the ot   tfa  new force wielder appears  planets get destroyed  mentor dies  big space station goes boomtlj  good guys start losing  learn more about the force  introspection  failure  some big revealros  palpatine  something something darkside  redemption  celebration sounds familiar dof would have been something fresh
1,i dissagree  they should have given episode ix and the rest of the sequel trilogy to directors who actually know a lot about star wars the expanded universe  although rian isin t the worst writer ever as everyone claims him to be  i just think he wouldnt be a good star wars director  but jj abrams   oh man i really wonder how he keeps getting hired to make movies honestly 
1,that s cool with math  but this is about teaching people to use the unifying energy of the universe  with a serious  it s trouble if they go bad  clause included 
1,my personal problem with the trilogy is it nullifies anakin s whole arc
1,very possibly  but a 4chan leak is better than an empty ball of nothing  which is my point  the equivalent of 4chan leaks say one thing  and there doesn t appear to be anything saying otherwise 
1,there were some interesting parts to the script but i can t decide if it s worse than tros or not  neither are exactly   good i still feel that the third movie was always doomed in following up what tlj set up   namely  not much  despite absolutely loathing tlj i d have been curious to see where rian would have taken the story in episode 9 
1,grievous  thingy is like one big wheel    the jet troopers in tros have those cool motorbike thingies   um  that s all i got
1,gideon intended to lose because he knew the lore behind the darksaber  luke showing up was the wildcard that derailed his plans 
1,they are tardis designs 
1,there s zero guarantee that shit plot choices would ve been ironed out when we got 3 movies worth of shit plot choices
1,it s been well established that george saw the force as inherently light and that dark side use corrupted the balance  hence why  bringing balance  meant eliminating the corrupting influence of the sith dark side 
1,not really  i m guessing you re referring to the holdo maneuver saying that  the rules of light speed have never been given a single canon explanation  and changed over and over  in the eu  there were about five or six explanations floating around  the entire situation was set up to be crazy impossible to replicate  and finn even says it was a million to one  i legitimately can t think of other stuff you might mean 
1,i appreciate the suggestions  also  excuse my ignorance  but how does canon work  will stories rotate out as new ones are written  i found a  timeline   and just trying to make sense of it all   a lot more to star wars than i knew  and i m excited as hell to dive in 
1,i mean  feel free to actively ignore the theme of tlj if you want  but it s clear what broom boy represents and if you re not aware of jedi genetics discussions going back years  i don t know what to tell you i ve pointed out elsewhere other clear examples of jedi families  skywalker  palpatine  maul and brother  mortis family it s there and people have been debating this for a long time it s clear what tlj was saying with broom boy 
1,i don t think any of that is canon  there was a jedi who was trained in the dark side by ventress in an attempt to assassinate dooku by the jedi council  quinlan vos  but he was corrupted and appeared to become dooku s new apprentgice for a while 
1,last jedi was good  i know may not be popular opinion but i enjoyed more than the force awakens
1,i m still getting my mind blown on a daily basis when i think about how each film had a different writer     in the same trilogy      just how 
1,it s treason  then 
1,i don t think that would have been better at all  just wrong in different ways 
1,probably easier to maintain  simpler to build  cheaper overall  easier to control  mostly a guess that one  
1,well  it s whatever the design team think looks coolest that drives the initial decision  but in universe i guess you could argue some things are better than others on certain terrain 
1,you re confusing it with light speed jumping 
1,oh you can hate it all you want  nobodys arguing that  but it mainly being a family thing has always been there
1,yup  the handling of luke s character was the most atrocious thing ever  in the ot he literally restores the fucking jedi  rotj ends on the note that the galaxy is free  and with luke s journey there is potential for the force to be an asset for good once again  this was only achieved from luke s sheer optimism and his belief that there s good in everyone but since it s such a  happy ever after  ending  i totally understand the writers not knowing exactly where to go with the story  but  luke learned nothing  evil is back  and here s a clueless new character to do it all again  is definitely not the way to go about it  especially when said clueless new character quickly becomes more capable than luke himself  and everyone else for that matter  but the mary sue is whole other issue   not to mention  luke optimism is thrown out the window    they literally just disregard everything the ot offers 
1,poe and rey should not have happened  kylo s ending needed polish  i give a thumbs up for tor valum though 
1,ah yes  the terrible problem of    extreme diversity  the casting was quite good  phenomenal really  it s not like we ended up with second rate actors because of some diversity quota  unless you actually want to make the argument that daisy  john  oscar  and kelly are somehow bad actors  they clearly are top class and its not like the movies are all that feminist beyond a lead being a competent female  it s not like there is some tangent about equal pay or maternity leave you are basically making a problem where none exists 
1,well put  i think people are getting too hung up on the concept of balancing with  darkness   really maybe a better word is something like passion  that isn t inherently bad the jedi of the prequel era were basically like  well  sith are passionate  so you cannot be passionate ever or you will become a sith  anakin s fall was a direct result of this  he fell in love because  of course  he s human  as plenty of other jedi did as shown in other media   but he felt he needed to to hide this part of his life from the jedi because it was forbidden  the jedi did not help their people learn how to manage this healthily  their approach was to simply deny the existence of these types of relationships  that s why they needed to take kids and raise them from birth   no attachments are easier when you raise kids as completely passionless celibates  luke saves his father not by becoming the ultimate ascetic monk but through his love for him and understanding there was a human underneath  the idea that this hero then went on to make essentially the same mistake as the jedi before  fearing that this  darkness  would take hold of someone he loved  his nephew and thus resolving to destroy it  is an interesting one and rey could be a character that is able to balance passion with caring and selflessness 
1,also probably the merciless annihilation of the leaders of the separatists 
1,yes  so funny
1, gt except mortis and countless other stories have blown lucas  visions out of the water  we are no longer in lucas territory  he s gone  for better or worse mortis was one of the clone wars stories that lucas had the most input on  and the entire arc is about how self destructive and flawed the grey jedi mentality of balancing light and dark is  despite the father s best efforts the son ends up destroying the family anyway  it fits perfectly with lucas s view of the dark side and the force 
1,you dont have to be a jedi if you have the force though
1,eh  it felt to me like a cool metaphor for jedi vs sith  the jedi were wise enough to lock it up  and avoid its temptation  ezra wants to save kanan  but realizes he can t  and let s it go  on the other hand  palps is willing to use it  and damn the consequences 
1,lol
1,oh  thought it was just solo and organa put together
1,the problem is the storytelling was just not very good and was also bad 
1,literally everything in your post is wrong  it is a throne room scene  that is the only similarity between that and rotj
1,so you know the lineages of those thousands of jedi  color me impressed the idea of jedi lineages predates this little website reddit dot com and the discussion is still going on skywalker  palpatine  maul and his brother  mortis family   
1,i mean  anakin was literally born fromnthe force and his kids had the force so they definetely set that up way before the sequels
1,i think they should have given kylo a sasuke ending of self exiled guardian of the galaxy 
1,that s not really true  gt  better at melee combat than luke  she has more experience than him when she first gets her hands on a lightsaber though  in the movies  it s never explored how luke learned the specifics of lightsaber fighting  gt  better pilot than han solo   have you seen solo  the first time he even touched the control of the falcon  a ship he s never flown  he manages to destroy an entire squadron of ties in the maelstrom then kills a suma vaerminoth using the maw then makes a jump with a unstable hyperdrive  escaping getting crush by two huge carbonbergs and he manages to establish a never beaten record on the kessel run   it s just that tech and visual effects were more advanced for the sequels compared to the ot so what she does seems more impressive but solo confirms that han is the better pilot  gt  better at languages than c3po  what the fuck she s shown to understand wookie  while han manages to speak wookie  and the teedo language  not that improbable considering how cosmopolitan niima outpost is 3po doesn t know the ewok language  at first  because nobody even knew they existed and he still manages to pull out a working translation in minutes  gt  better at believing in the jedi than luke  care to rephrase that until the end of tlj  rey didn t even want to become a jedi  luke jumped at the chance in anh and left the smoldering corpses of his only family  we don t even know if he buried them   to join obi wan  amp  x200b rey has flaws as a character but you re just being salty for the sake of being salty 
1, gt  there is potential if done right true  but i think the final movie of the trilogy would be busy with many other things and doing romance right just wouldn t happen  tho i guess i m just kinda subconsciously assuming it would be about as good as finn rose thing from tlj  and that s why i m less than ecstatic for such subplot maybe some short series happening after the movie tho  with less things to do at once   that would be cool thing to explore 
1,fan service isn t inherently bad  bad fan service  is bad  fan service is bad when it s out of place  forced in  and overall feels like  hey  hey  remember how much you liked x  look  we got x too   it s the equivalent of a bad car salesman trying to force you to buy a shitty broken fiat500 because look it s green and you like green  vs tesla selling their car with a free flamethrower because they know their boss is nuts and made flamethrowers  so it s an amusing in joke for tesla fans windu is an actual character in the universe  his whereabouts  fate  lightsaber location are all completely up in the air  hux being a force fangirl and collecting lightsabers means there s a fair chance someone of his resources managed to obtain the unique purple one  having it be his seppuku sword is a fan nod but isn t  forced in  
1,i think it would have been a good move to have luke be the last jedi  and then for rey to rebuild a jedi like order but call themselves skywalkers as an homage to both anakin and luke and the progressing ability to balance the lighter and darker sides of themselves  eventually leading to the skywalker  jedi like order  being essentially grey jedi 
1,the point is  that it s a concept that s not going away  it doesn t matter who s for it and who s against it  it s been done already  multiple times in multiple ways  the expectation is already there  also  i m pretty sure the mace stuff is still canon but what do i know 
1,if they did do this they could have messed up and ruin the darksaber  mortis and more  now they can instead be retconned and let mando and the upcoming shows handle the good stuff 
1,carrie fisher died in 2016 while the last jedi released in 2017  she died while rogue one was in theatersher having been dead for a while was part of the blowback about her superman maneuver
1,jesus you are obsessed with this bloodline shit  get over it you lost
1,omg       im sorry but your m count is too low for this subreddit  anakin was knighted like a year before taking ahsoka on as a padawan  jedi padawan have that hair braid that hangs off the side and anakin no longer has that in ep 3  he only calls kenobi master as a term of respect which he extends to all jedi that outrank him not because obi wan was still his master  grandmaster yoda even calls anakin  master skywalker  when he was overseeing anakin s instruction of ahsoka 
1,anakin showed up at the end of ros though
1,how much is defeating palpatine worth  though  somehow  palpatine returned  
1,yeah  he s stated that he had plans for a sequel trilogy three separate times  with wildly different plots 
1,the entire series is built upon a bloodline  forgive us if we think that s a key part of the series also  there obviously is familial aspect  see  skywalker  palpatine  maul and his brother  the mortis family   
1,i also read insiders saying that walt disney personally fired kathleen kennedy and killed her children so maybe these  insiders  are just the equivalent of 4chan leaks
1,it doesn t really feel like luke and leia did much against the first  amp  final orders  they were tertiary figureheads and even luke s final stand was kind of a hollow diversion for a dozen or so people to get away  rey was the one who really accomplished victory through and through  and the first  amp  final order and surviving palpatine undermines the accomplishment of defeating the empire and palpatine  also anakin skywalker becomes a non factor as the chosen one if his prophesied balancing of the force only lasted for 30 years and what he was supposed to balance actually wasn t gone 
1,no one talks about that because we already knew that  jj freaked out and just confirmed every half baked sw fan theory he could find on reddit and called it the final chapter because he wanted the nerds to like his movie it was what it was 
1,lmao they did that themselves with tlj  it was never consistent to begin with 
1, gt  tlj killed that with the destruction of luke s academy wasn t that tfa 
1,you can t make millions of people happy all at once  that doesn t mean they couldn t satisfy most sw fans  all they had to do was have a plan  write movies that make sense  that don t shit all over the accomplishments and legacies of characters we know and love  it s not rocket science but they didn t care  look at how much praise the mandalorian is getting for simply having ahsoka  boba and luke do cool stuff even though the writing is still pretty weak  it s not hard to make most sw fans happy  so that should really tell you how much they fucked up with the sequels  gt  they should have stayed the courseas if they were on one to begin with  they had no plans 
1,people say they want well written star wars but what many of them mean is luke slywalker blowing up a million battle droids with force lightning because that s cool  lucas thought the whole grey jedi thing was really stupid 
1,really though  because honestly  there was nothing they could do at any point after that  i ve literally heard people trash on tlj  say it s the worst thing to happen to star wars  then admit they never saw it  sadly  anytime something new is tried  tpm  tlj   people lose their shit 
1,i mean  movie  being used a little loosely  here s the  vid   according to wookiepedia  obi convinced the council to consider their duel with dooku as one of the trials too 
1,the sequel trilogy is nothing more then a spice dream of luke s 
1,i agree with the notion that tfa and tlj are ruined by the lame plot of rise  glad to know i m not the only one 
1,assuming kylo didn t massacre him and rey bothered to establish another order not a problem if you don t consider them canon 
1,his final moments when he tries to kill luke and screams since he got tricked  thats what cemented him as the bad guy
1,it s much easier than that  they had no idea what they were doing 
1,i d disagree   read the script and was unimpressed   sure  it would probably have been better than the ix we got  but that s a very low bar 
1,has returned
1,using both the dark and light side is contradictory to the entire lore of the force  it s a bunch of edgy  grey jedi  bullshit that doesn t belong in star wars 
1,considering we now see how ros chose to end things  it was an odd choice to end with broom boy  that felt more like the end of a trilogy moment  it was hopeful and upbeat  despite the precarious position of the resistance  and  to me  it was cool but unnecessary  instead  they should have had poe sending a distress call and get a response  except  it s palpatine    at last the work of generations is complete  the great error is corrected  the day of victory is at hand  the day of revenge  the day of the sith   end on a down note like esb and have people digesting the idea of palpatine s return  which wasn t kept a secret anyway  
1,if op s post is anything to go off  they are not harnessing the dark as good  they are opening themselves to the fact that everyone has dark within them  becoming human 
1,duel of the fates was pretty bad too imo  it did have a few good ideas  like going to coruscant  which is ridiculously absent and not even mentioned in the films we got  but i doubt the st would be any more highly regarded than it is now  i mean  it s colin trevorrow  he doesn t exactly have a great record 
1,how though  anakin has two kids  both of whom are crazy powerful in the force  leia doesn t use it  but yoda thinks she s worth training   even before the sequels in the eu  they made it pretty clear that most force users with kids gave birth to force users 
1,i guess i always took it as  genetics don t matter  except  for the case of anakin and luke  just based on the sheer amount of non skywalker or palpatine related force users there are in the eu  it was never really question of whether or not you had to belong to a bloodline  you just had to be able to use the force 
1,plot are the events that happen story is how characters respond to events the story is what i laid out above  now  i can think of any number of plots to make characters grow in the way i described  personally  i don t really care what the plot is  so long as it achieves the goal of making the characters undergo interesting a difficult character struggles  which is the heart of my point  the sequel to tlj had plenty of potential  having some sort of idea of where the plot is going is irrelevant as the characters had pretty clear directions that would be interesting  the problem with tros as written is that it has lots of plot but little story 
1,question  how come you rate the force awakens 8 10   id say the movie is the worst of them all because it doesnt make any sense  the characters are all super fucking dumb and its basically a reboot of a new hope  honestly the whole sequel trilogy is a giant reboot  i think the effects and practical effects where great  but the rest of the movie did not really make a lot of sense in my opinion 
1,in the legends continuity  yes  but even then  it did go against lucas and what he said filoni has also been against the  grey  idea too
1,  
1,rey reminds me really strongly of a nice young lady i know who is a lesbian  so for me  subconciously  rey is a lesbian  it would be fucking weird for me if she had a male love interest 
1,all that stuff from  insiders  about jj and rian hating each other is baloney  right up there with kathleen kenedy being  fired  every year since 2016 and the mandalorian rebooting the timeline 
1,that something in the sw universe isn t  a thing  is a dumb argument 
1,i don t understand how it could have a better story  at points   if you want to argue some of its story beats we re better  that s fair  but a story is a string of beats 
1,yeah  they actually showed some degree of chemistry in the previous films with the jacket stuff   tbh i just hated reylo because like  he literally tortured her in the first movie
1,they shoulda just let me write this bad boy  my ideas were way better though the finn storyline is similar to mine 
1,do the movies seem to indicate that the skywalker bloodline is  stronger   yeah  sure  but at no point do any of the movies indicate that you can t be force sensitive without being a skywalker  the only way to assume  that  is by assuming that literally every jedi and sith is a skywalker  which is very obviously not the case furthermore  we see no evidence of broom boy being of  skywalker level force sensitivity   which means there s no delineation between him and other non skywalker force users 
1,i know jeremy jahns has a youtube video about this movie that never happened  but i would ve really loved to see how this movie would ve turned out   i liked the fact that they didn t try and redeem kylo and kept him evil and go more into the darkness and actually gave the characters something to do and how i think the final battle happens on coursaunt and there s no death star isb s and they have a fight on a star destroyer  but i guess we ll never know how things would ve turned out im duel of the fates  unless we start a release the trevarow cut like justice league is getting the snyder cut 
1,i always thought the core problem was the initial setting for the sequels it s been a couple of decades since rotj and the jedi order has once again been essentially wiped out again  the empire is basically back without any explanation and the republic gets destroyed instantly they set up this treasure hunt for luke and you re sitting there s logically only a few things he could be doing rebuilding the jedi order  again    meditating on the nature of the force    or something in a similar manner to yoda when he just sat on dagobah for decades    or luke is very burnt out or scarred from the destruction of the order he essentially raised from the dead the latter seems very uncharacteristic of luke well it turned out to be the latter   but tbh there wasn t much of a choice to begin with i may of digressed a bit but the whole  point is that they set up the sequels horribly from the get go by basically putting us back to square one i think a lot of people would like luke and his reestablished  not all but destroyed   jedi order facing a threat together that has some origins in the unknown regions which could be yuuhzan vong inspired 
1,the poe rey thing is   just wtf    really forced and completely unnaturalcompletely dropping finn s entire arc out and making him some weird side character with the worst love story ever it s so frustrating  how do you have that much talent and money and you cant even put together a somewhat coherent story  who is this safe for  who wants this more than a good story 
1,ehh to be fair they really cemented the whole  kylo is evil thing in 8  i get that he can be redeemed  but they really did seem to want to go full evil
1,the dead speak 
1,did you skip the prequels or what  this was never needed  what about the thousands of jedi we see there  they re not even allowed to have attachments  where do you think new force users come from  it was never about belonging to an important bloodline  let s stop pretending as if the sequels are the ones introducing that idea  belonging to a powerful bloodline can help you get stronger faster  but that s about it  just like irl  your genes matter too 
1,maybe  that s an easing thought  i remember hearing that the very early concepts had kylo as a half human half droid gollum like character who had an obsession with force artifacts like luke s metal hand
1,finn and po were great friends  you don t have to make two guys gay just because they show affection to each other  i thought it was good to show two straight men could be that close 
1,i think it s unilever s heartbrand local name in the sw universe   s
1,long story short  the trilogy  needed  a team like those working on mandalorian 
1,regardless of who s to blame  i would have liked to see more of them
1,and it s not a disney thing bc they re getting character portrayals and history done right with their series  mando  rebels  upcoming ones   i think it was just the people in charge of those specific movies
1,i mean  while i agree that there doesn t always have to be a romance  if her character is straight she s going to want someone  and he s around  and likable  if she went grey jedi  then there would be no rule about avoiding romance  this would let us explore the idea of a force user having an unforbidden romance  which we haven t actually seen  we could even have a scene where poe goes on a mission  and rey has to struggle with the pain worrying about him  causing the dark side to tug on her  there is potential if done right 
1,the idea that family or genetics play in jedi is old and there s a reason everyone was speculating about rey s parents for years  my dude pretending like jedi bloodlines wasn t a thing is ignoring decades of star wars discussions johnson out broom boy at the end precisely for the reason i stated  the entire film lays the case that you don t need to be special to be a jedi apparently disney at one point saw the purpose of doing so  even if you don t and they changed course with tros 
1,another reason why tlj is a shit movie  it made no sense  it was never established in ot or prequels  that jedis and force sensitives had any form of familial lineage  the skywalkers were an exception and central to the storyline because anakin was the chosen one   remember jedi order in the prequels didn t allow marriage and kids  hence no bloodline  new jedi were recruited out of nowhere  which is why tlj s broom kid and the message that anyone can be a jedi is redundant and stupid   that was always the case
1,there s still 30ish years he could exist in before the sequels  maybe he does die in the academy destruction
1,pretty much so its quite clear that this version of balance within the force can still work especially with what george introduced in the tv shows
1,maybe give us some proof
1,i like everything about the cancelled movie except kylo rens fate  i prefer him turning and using the skywalker lightsaber way more  other than that it sounds like a better end to a saga
1,i ve always thought that luke was able to defeat vader in rotj because he tapped into the dark side   shouting  no   and acting with anger out of love for his sister  that was not the behavior of a jedi    but he then conquers the dark side by rejecting it when facing the emperor  i think that works and can still be seen as a defeat of the dark side while allowing the possibility of a future character being powerful because she is able to draw power from both the light and dark sides without being corrupted  the raw power of the dark side remains  but it loses its ability to corrupt the wielder 
1,because the first order wasn t big at all  they re like 1 50 the size of the empire  and i mean it s not like the astroid belt served a purpose except to go provide an exciting chase scene before parking on a big one 
1,oh hm thought it was before
1,so many questions     we need more movies so we can have answers i guess if i aged out of having kids i might become a jedi
1,i agree with you  this is well thought out and written  the original script and concept art were far superior to the rise of skywalker  disney s biggest mistake was rewriting that script 
1,i agree  i think if this  duel of the fates  was ever considered  it was disregarded much earlier on  and independent of the backlash from tlj  the way i see it  jj set up a bunch of stuff in 7  johnson came along and disregarded it all and everyone hated it  so they brought jj back to bring things back on course  and try to salvage everything 
1,carrie fisher died after tlj was released  so they had no way of knowing it would happen when tlj was released 
1,the thing is  that scene  was  cut  so until those got revealed  that s all we really knew  and between the ot and pt that s what the image was of yoda  it makes the aotc fight especially jarring  it s never really sat well with me for that reason 
1,this is really the biggest problem i have with the sequels  the missed opportunities  there was so much potential with force lore that only really got explored in clone wars rebels  it could have been an amazing finale to the whole saga  instead it got eviscerated and we got the heaping pile of trash that was tros  worst movie in the series  and it s not close 
1,i mean there s a script with a whole ass storyline that is exciting and connects to multiple different movies and shows that s a direct sequel to tlj  that was written while it was filming doesn t seem like he killed every potential storyline tbh 
1,rian said he had as much freedom writing tlj compared to when he wrote his own movies  which means he could have done whatever he wanted which means there was no plan  it s not like tlj is perfectly consistent with tfa  tfa tells us that luke went looking for the first jedi temple  tlj tells us that he went there to die  why find that place specifically if it was to wait and die  it doesn t make sense  same thing with anakin s lightsaber calling to anakin  luke and rey in tfa and then tlj telling us that rey is a nobody  snoke telling hux in tfa to find kylo and that he will fulfill his training  and in tlj  no such training occurs  he does mention in tlj that kylo will fulfill his training by executing rey  so it s not even a fight  she was unarmed and held down on the floor  and he had to kill a girl he barely knew to  ¬†fulfill his training¬†   it doesn t make sense 
1,what s wrong with solana particularly 
1,and that those new jedi would be referred to as skywalkers    i was so sure that s where they were going
1, gt  this post is beyond generous to it i understand the sentiment tho  the grass is always greener on the other side  same reason some people treat the george trilogy that didn t happen with similar longing  or why people wanted to see snyder cut so badly they memed it into reality 
1,plenty of people bring up duel of the fates as being something they would have preferred 
1,duel of the fates had some good ideas  and i think it s highs are higher than tros s  but it s lows are much  much lower imo  of course  this was only a first draft but things like ben solo scharacter arc were handled better in tros than the mess that dotf was for him  he s committed to evil for most of the script  then in the last seconds of his life  he decides to kill himself instead of killing rey  at least tros dedicated itself to his redemption instead of being whatever dotf was 
1,how does being stuck in a field of multimillion pound rocks compare to dead empty space  and they sent tie fighters up  with no regard to thier safety  first order sent 1 small squad 
1,now witness the firepower of this armed and fully operational coffee station 
1,i mean i m a massive star wars fan  but i honestly don t care about  rules  or whatever  as long as they ain t like flying or some shit  they can go crazy with the force  i m in this for the characters and arcs 
1,i think kennedy should have stuck with one director and one team of writers for three films 
1,  
1,jar jar binks wasn t even that bad lmao 
1,he was supposed to kill every potential storyline in the 2nd movie of a trilogy and fuck over the 3rd director  yeah  great job
1,skywalkers were important because anakin was the chosen one  you re confusing the skywalker family line being the central focus of the story with jedis needing a familial lineage    force sensitive people were never established to have any family lineage  keep in mind the jedi order didn t allow marriage and hence no kids  how were they supposed to recruit more padawans if being force sensitive was a genetic trait passed down  use your head before you reply next time
1,the worst feeling when watching reading about a bad movie is missed potential  this sounds so great
1,it looks a hell of a lot brighter than it did in 2011 coming off the back of legacy of the force and fate of the jedi 
1,disney should have gone with the legends continuity 
1,aww he looks so cute  lt 3
1,  
1,that s exactly what yoda learns in season 6 of clone wars
1,i say all three movies are bad  i honestly can t enjoy any of them now that i am older  while i am still able to enjoy the original trilogy and even the prequels  i don t hate the movies  i just think they are real fucking bad lmao 
1,you mean the franchise that s about to launch a bunch of new tv series  and just finished a highly profitable trilogy of movies  listen  if star wars can survive the pt  it s definitely not a ruined franchise now  it prints money  it s attracting a new audience  it s doing fine 
1,the real problem is that kathleen kennedy etc felt nothing but contempt for the old fans  compare writers like favreau that love the old fans 
1,there s still technically a possibility they could go in that direction  but i don t expect disney or even george lucas to have the balls to green light something like that  they both seem to agree that the light side is good  and dark side is bad  no gray areas
1,you have some good points but i think if a movie needed me to know what context from a tv show and video game to understand a movie it still wouldn t be very good  i mean i would have liked it because i know what the darksaber and mortis is but like what about average joe moviewatcher  that seems like a bigger reason why those details got cut 
1,lol
1,i think more so bc the movies rushed everything  i understand why he s so powerful but from a movie perspective they gave him no back story to using his powers or developing them nor did they show him doing that much with what he had  like we saw yoda very few times but from what we saw we understood he was just crazy  like knocking out the two sith guards with a wave of a finger  anyway yea i think it s bc the movies rushed it
1,eh  i wouldn t say that the prequels have a good structure considering the films alone   they don t have a beginning  middle and end  they have a prologue  tpm   a first act  aotc  and a third act  rots   tcw became act 2 of the story after the fact but there s a reason why  before the prequels became much more accepted  many would say only rots was good  tpm was seen as completely useless to the overarching story  and while it s not useless per se  it s it s not essential either  and aotc was also seen as expendable because the execution was poor and many plot threads introduced  especially sifo dyas  weren t resolved in rots 
1,kylo doesn t really die evil  he s evil for most of the script until literally his last few seconds alive where he hears his mom or something and suicides himself to save rey from himself  it s weird to say the least
1,thank you for sharing  that video was great i loved kylo was looking for answers in  ask sheev com 
1,  
1,in my headcanon  the empire mined out illum  then went  hmm    wouldn t it be neat if we built a superweapon   then space darpa drew up the plans  the fo found the plans  and since they are complete lunatics  they decided to actually build it 
1,it s not about force sensitivity being a genetic trait  it s more about how you have to be some important person s kid to do important things yourself  a la anakin and luke  obi wan makes a big deal to luke about how his dad was this great jedi and implies that it s luke s destiny to fill his shoes  and then it turns out that the emperor s right hand man is actually luke s father  anakin when the sequel trilogy comes around  they try and turn that idea on it s head  by having the antagonist be obsessed with legacy and inheritance and having a protagonist who dreams about having an important lineage  but  in regards to tlj  at least  is the child of the star wars equivalent of homeless drug addicts then they betray that thematic development in tros so it doesn t even matter 
1,honestly wasn t very compelling to me  really wacky ideas  i m glad it was discarded  the sequels failed twice  the first time when tlj subverted everything set up in tfa and killed a bunch of possibly interesting plot threads  the second is when tros spent an hour retconning tlj  had either movie acted in good faith to the previous one the trilogy would have been acceptable  i would have been happy with the sequel that tfa or tlj promised  but we got neither of those 
1,i did  that s my bad 
1,exactly  he s a symbol  nothing more 
1,an entire armada capable of traveling at light speed  simply could have hopped in front of them and cornered them   movie over  roll credits 
1,watched  this   last night and i had be to agree with whats said about tlj it s gorgeously shot film from color to cinematography love it hate it i agree in that it s the best st movie simply because it broke the mold  would have loved to have seen duel of the fates really bummed they couldn t make it and can t do a  snyder cut  as all the main actors have seemingly disavowed these films  it s a shame but give it 15 years and i might like these movies  starwars is starwars and i love it for starwars  that being said i won t go out of my way to watch the st 
1,show us then  which scene was for dotf  the only thing really kept was exploring poe s home world 
1,a jedi is someone who is taught by a jedi and chooses to be a jedi luke was taught by the last two living  non sith  members of the jedi council and given a directive to pass on what he has learned  he is not a jedi of the old jedi order  he is a jedi of whatever new order he chose to create  every student who learned from him at his own academy was a jedi  or at least a jedi in training  if they chose to be  and that ultimately includes rey  who combines what she learned from luke with what she learns from leia  who learned it from a luke that was more willing to teach  and from the texts  without the formality of the jedi order  or even luke s jedi  rey is the first of a new order of jedi 
1,no worries  i write entire essays on this sub  too  as i have read duel of the fates  i 100  agree  tros was an absolute disaster of a shit show  and dotf really gives the sequels meaning  and really ties the saga together  i love the fact it was so tied to fallen order  because it doesn t ignore the prequels  the whole sequel trilogy just fucking ignored everything  dotf would have been a stellar movie 
1,my message might get lost amongst the others but this is fascinating  i had no idea  this version of episode 9 sounds amazing  i wouldn t have minded 8 so much if there was a point to it but it felt to me like the series going completely off the rails  with 9 being the crash into the canyon and resulting explosion  
1,my wife came up with a great one    but i was going into tosche station to pick up some power coffee  
1,you realize that s not a plot though  right  nothing you ve said is anything happening at all 
1,the knights of ren sucking is entirely to blame on rian for not including them at all 
1,the hope was that anakin having somebody to teach would help him master himself as well  and the order was in need of more jedi out on the frontlines generally  you probably wouldn t be giving a recently knighted jedi  esp  one as young as anakin  a padawan though  you d want to let them get into the groove of not being the apprentice and figure themselves out more as they grow as jedi before having them become full time mentors 
1,how did they retcon it in the next film  you see it done over the forest moon of endor as two ewoks look up into the sky 
1,not sure why they didn t just switch luke and leia dying in tlj if that was the issue instead of jj first drafting a movie together
1,sadly if they had gone in this direction there would still be voices saying they didn t like it for  insert reason here  
1,i mean if you want to follow your format it can be done sequels  kylo ren becomes ben solo  rey becomes a jedi knight  the empire rises and falls again 
1,colin trevorrow is a bad director though  yeah the film seemed solid on paper and the concept art is great but that has nothing to do with the finished product   the jurassic park movies hes done are embarrassing and look terrible   stiff acting  all cgi  look like glossy plastic  completely went against the entire feel they were trying for with the sequels and all the new star wars really   i had no faith in him from the get go 
1,i mean empire literally had them stuck on an aestroid after going through a long chase  plus that was a subplot  
1,my god  he turns back to the light in dotf   
1,mate the sequel trilogy was doomed from the start  but it all started with the tfa honestly  the story was so bad in my opinion  almost nothing in the movie made any sense whatsoever  why tf would you blame the tlj haters  they should have already had a story ready before tlj came out  its just another point that disney had no idea what they where going with in this trilogy   
1,  
1,well  this is what i always rant about with my friends   they did have one writer   everyone complains that rian johnson threw out j j  s plan  but everyone forgets that j j  threw out michael arndt s plan   the very first person kathleen kennedy hired was michael arndt  oscar winning screenwriter of little miss sunshine and toy story 3  to map out and write the sequel trilogy   in case you re wondering about arndt s star wars cred  he literally wrote his masters thesis on why a new hope has the greatest climax in all of film and still lectures on it at film schools   anyway  j j  didn t like arndt s plan   felt it focused too much on the new characters   j j  wanted to make the old man solo film   so he threw out arndt s plan and rewrote force awakens to focus more on han solo   why wasn t j j  fired like so many directors after him for taking a star wars film in the wrong direction   because for years kennedy and her old producing partner steven spielberg have been hyping j j  as the next spielberg   so they gave him a hell of a lot more leeway   so j j  got to make his old man solo film  michael arndt s plan was reduced to a bunch of vague questions  because building a series out of vague questions worked for j j   on lost  and now the new trilogy is stuck without a plan 
1,very interesting  i think this provides a good explanation for many of the faults  granted not all of them  that people have with the st  changed my perspective at least 
1,a good example of how tlj sorta  tried  something new but utterly failed rey and kylo team up against snoke  defeat him and talk for a minute about starting over and killing the past and blah blah will rey take him up on his offer  oh boy  an entirely new dynamic in star wars  this could be interesting   welp  nevermind  two minutes later we re back to rebels vs  empire and angry kylo yelling really loud about killing all the rebels    hey kylo  what about all that  kill the past  stuff   why so obsessed with killing an old lady and her two dozen friends   
1,has no one read the script for dotf  he does not die evil  he s evil until the very end  when he turns back to the light  as for poe and rey  i like that  it perfectly fits poe s fly boy character  and is a concept that is not dropped  like their utterly stupid relationship in tros 
1,episode 9 would have been significantly better if kylo ren went on a quest to bring him back  as opposed to him somehow returning 
1,my issue with the sequels is that they weren t really a trilogy  they were 3 stories that were loosely tied together  on top of that  they ignored the pre existing lore of luke having a kid and leah having 3  ben solo was kind of a knockoff of jacen solo imo   the sequels took the prophecy that drove the first 2 trilogies and said haha jk and made it null and void by making palpatine live  the worst part is that the sequel trilogy was supposed to be about  the daughter   leah  the first trilogy  prequel  was about  the father   anakin and the ot was about  the son   luke  overall  it was evident that the writers lacked intimate star wars knowledge and were simply trying to make the avengers but with lightsabers don t get me wrong  the actors played their parts very well and made the movies somewhat enjoyable  as standalone films  they re fine  as star wars films  and as a star wars trilogy  they were terrible edit  i agree with you that if they had kept the original episode 9 that they had planned  it may have made up for the blunders of the first 2 movies and it s a shame that they scrapped it 
1,palpatine
1,i would say johnson purposefully let the door open to both endings for kylo   his final few moments in tlj show him alone  lost  confused  not like a confident vilain  abrams chose to have him turn good  and i think it was worth it just for than han ben scene but maybe that s just me  but he could believably have him ultimately choose evil and still work with tlj too 
1,you monster     
1,to make it even worse  the relationship between poe and rey has beyond a canny similarity to the awful relationship between chriss pratt s and bryce dallas howard s characters from jurassic world  which trevorrow also wrote   trevorrow s script has some interesting things in it  but also a lot of dumb shit  this post is beyond generous to it 
1,ah lol gotcha
1, gt it s just clear sequels fans enjoy the movies and don t care about the actual franchise  the people making them don t care about star wars at all  and neither do the fans of the st i m not sure why you d say that  those of us who love the sequels absolutely love the franchise    it s absolutely fine if you don t like the sequels  but to say that the hundreds of people who worked so hard on those movies don t care about star wars is absurd  watch any of the behind the scenes videos and  making of  documentaries and you ll see just how much attention to detail and love went into these movies    again   it s fine if you don t like the st and if you feel that they don t match your vision of what star wars should be  that doesn t mean that the movies were bad   from the moment george lucas created star wars it s always been a living  evolving franchise 
1,this is where the fun begins
1,you wanna go   i ll back out  the shank saber battysith
1,that is a good order to read some of the best books in i was doing it off the top of my head  so i didn t know where to fit in the black fleet crisis series    
1,ah  the hair has nothing to do with it being filler  that s just another aspect of the episode i didn t particularly like  although it is a minor nitpick in fairness
1,i 100  agree with everything you said here 
1,  
1,i agree  it was never a point that  needed  to be made because it s  really bloody obvious  but that doesn t change the fact that it very clearly seems to have been the point at least  some  of the disney leaders  wanted  to make  because they re morons  
1,funny that baby yoda is gonna be the one that learns how to separate attachment from fear
1, gt he was the embodiment of the idea that you don t need a specific bloodline to be special   that you could be  nobody  and still learn the ways of the force erm  since when was the opposite ever suggested in star wars  there were literally thousands of jedi in the prequels from all kinds of backgrounds  i mean come on  look at ahsoka all jedi cared about was whether you were force sensitive  bloodlines had fuck all to do with it 
1,not yet 
1,that would have been cool  i liked the idea of them as an ancient race of force wielders that seems to have disappeared  it makes them mysterious 
1,i don t think the sequels are bad  in fact i found some of what they proposed interesting  but i still prefer the other trilogies to it
1,oh  i dont remeber it
1,show me then  where s the dotf footage 
1,not to mention the effects of not having those coping skills when you pile on layers and layers of ptsd from the clone wars 
1,hello there
1,i completely agree the force awakens  for what it is  is enjoyable  but its derivative premise doomed the sequel trilogy  at least the last jedi  also good  tried doing something different  but i d have preferred for them to do a new republic thing instead 
1,no  that s not what he said at all  why are you speaking for him 
1,damn this sounds way better than what we got  i also have to imagine we would have actually gone into the knights of ren s story rather than hastily killing them before we can ask questions
1,i think what they mean is that you can take some lines from rots to be foreshadowing that palpatine really does have a way to cheat death  at least for himself in fact  i believe that was the point of palps quoting specifically  the dark side of the force is the pathway to many abilities some would consider    unnatural    although if i d written the script  he d probably have said  sorry  movie s not long enough to explore that  let s hurry along  because that s what the line feels like 
1,i m never going to understand how someone can love a movie where a fleet  chases  a ship going at an ants pace 
1,no but i mean what do the hairstyles have to do with the episodes being filler 
1,i miss the days when the pt movies were the only sw movies i pretended weren t canon  the st movies at least proved that lucas isn t the only one who has a hard time making good sw movies 
1,its really what they tried to do with the force that bugs me  the prequels really did little new to challenge our view of the force  the healing isn t new  it has been in eu material and hinted at in clone wars  the ghosts  contact with the physical is newish  tbf  though it is completely unexplored  so it is both not out of the ordinary to expect something  new    yoda s lightning was on first watch shocking to me  but not necessarily poor understanding of the force  bendu did the same thing  luke catching a lightsaber however was  if he can hold a physical object in a place with high concentrations of the force  why can t he fight then we have rey and ben s communication through the force  i didn t like it  but who am i to say the communication by itself is out of the realm of possibility  where i draw the line is them transporting physical items through this connection  and it is brushed off as oh they are a diad in the force  it sits about as well for me as the way between worlds  two force things disney has introduced i absolutely do not care for  i think my reaction to these things is akin to the reaction of ot fans to midichlorians   it cheapens the force as it was   i want simple things like chirrut s force walk  i don t like these things that defy presented laws of time and space  i liked rey s story  i liked ben s story  i liked finn and poe in 7 
1,the movies are black white good evil tropes with not a huge amount of nuance   i d chock it up more to not exploring it too much in the films rather than it being an alternative take 
1,i don t see any reason why you couldn t take the best parts of rise of skywalker  the best parts of duel of the fates  and actually make a brilliant ending to the best saga in history  and like op points out  this would pay off things in tfa tlj to justify the sequel trilogy s existence as a whole please disney  make it right someday  i promise nobody will care about canonizing a new ep9
1,or maybe rian did as we was supposed to  since there s a decent sequel script that was written while tlj was filming 
1,do you have any sources on that  i distinctly recall insiders saying jj and rian genuinely hated each other  rian pointedly ignored jj s notes for where he was intending threads to go  and jj thought rian had written tlj to deliberately tear up as much of tfa as he could like  from what i remember they  literally did  write their own scripts in complete separation from each other and not as a team  gt  the biggest being his request to put r2 on ach to so he could write his and luke s reunion i mean this right here is what made me call bullshit  the  biggest request  was basically a non change for a non existent  reunion moment   and yet rian killing off snoke was such a curveball jj literally called mcdiarmid last minute asking him to reprise creamy sheev 
1,failing to accomplish anything except  oh you know  defeating palpatine and the empire  including their last grasp at power with the first and final orders   and luke and leia ensuring the jedi live on in some form through their work and teachings  erm
1,people have been bringing up issues with the st since tlj  especially since tros  but lucasfilm has handled the criticism so poorly and disrespectfully   there is an entire online community that has been saying much of the same criticisms you have  it has greatly divided the fanbase  and many older fans like me that grew up with the ot feel like the st did too much to disrespect the legacy of st  at least the pt didn t take a dump on the legacy 
1, i  am the senate 
1,how is that a bad thing  forgive me for the heresy  but imo lucas s vision of the force is completely boring because it is utterly void of ambiguity or complexity  everything is jedi   good everyone else   bad   amp  x200b my favorite part of the franchise is kotor specifically because it challenges this view  the jedi are shown to be fallible  even deeply flawed  and the sith have a purpose beyond giving motivation for the protagonist 
1,you re welcome to like or dislike whatever you want  but your preferences don t make you more correct than anybody else 
1,i usually stop the movie just before the kiss and play my imaginary ending with proper development lol  i feel your feelings
1,big oof
1,i think they are pretty bad  if that s the current style people have right now then wow lol  my mother owns a hairdressers  maybe i should show her and get her opinion although i suppose it is star wars so it s not out of the question for somebody to have a wacky haircut  princess leia being an example 
1, gt the movies focus too much on the dark and the light  as if they re two different sides of the coin  but there is no coin uhhh the movies are where everything originated so thats a stupid take  if the movies want to focus on both sides  then that s the way it is  wtf are you thinking 
1,thanks for first realy detiled answer  got to watch 2003 movie now 
1,it s star wars  the old cannon  the eu 
1,the pt didn t have that great of a story  it s a pretty boring plot about anakin getting in the vader costume  by likes i mean the details we get from dialogue about time before anh
1,that movie sounds fantastic  what a bummer that it got scrapped
1, there s no way i haven t heard abo    gah fuck 
1,i ve read duel of the fates  it s a mess  more so than the rise of skywalker
1,if they had to do it it should have been poe and finn  they at least had chemistry  but i agree  no need for any romance  there wasn t enough time spent on the characters for any romance to feel anything but forced  no pun intended 
1,nah man it s like watching episode 3 then episode 1 lol
1,there s no big deal about theyr haircut but whatever   gt anyway maybe there is some sort of payoff later in the seasonoh boy        
1,seems like a good theory to me  i agree that they reacted to harshly to the backlash from tlj  the story they wanted to tell was good  they should have trusted it 
1,the idea that lucasfilm  the multi billion dollar corporation  got scared of redditors complaining about tlj and scrapped what would ve been a much more fitting conclusion to the trilogy is laughably sad  do you think if george lucas listened to the criticism from ep i and ii  he would ve never made rots  of course  kennedy and jj are not lucas  and disney is afraid of their shareholders  but to completely scrap the last 1 3 of the story because you re afraid seems absurd to me 
1,this is not the way 
1,the sequel trilogy failed overall because they gave rian johnson full control and didn t do shit about it to change anything he was doing    rian johnson is an arrogant prick who thought just because  empire got roasted back then  that he can just do what he wants and think his movie would ve been the next  empire  but low and behold  it flopped  at least in terms of storytelling also jj  abrams doesn t know how to tell stories  but instead make any action present on screen just  bigger  and doesn t know how to tell a full story  but instead just leave breadcrumbs and mystery that never really unfolds   
1,considering it s the end of the run  those episodes not being epic in scope does make them seem out of place a bit  or somewhat anticlimactic  considering their placement in the final season  that i can see  totally  but what do you mean about the haircuts 
1,what imma say is just based off my opinions and the leaks i read  so if i m wrong about a leak or something just lemme know  but  tbh it also sounds like a mess  it sounds cool in some parts  and probably better than what we got but that s so much information to put in one film  sounds like it would ve had the same problems where the knights of ren still blow  kylo still has a seemingly meaningless death and the force absorption power seems ridiculous  especially when in the end he only uses it to a  train  b  use it on the guy who taught him it and c  the main character  it makes poe comedic relief from the sound of it  especially with how much rey seems to mind control him  them stealing a star destroyer would take so long that it would either take way too much of the movie considering how much else has to be crammed into it or be criminally skipped over  obviously we didn t get it and it could ve been rad  but imo i think it would ve fallen short because of the same disney politics that made the actual ep  9 a pretty big failure  it definitely seems to improve on a lot of people s gripes  having palpatine return in a holocron would ve been better than being like actually alive  plus keeping holocrons compared to with wayfinders or whatever they were called  kylo confronting his vader obsession and coming to the  i m more powerful than you i don t need you anymore  conclusion would ve probably triggered fanboys but it was progression i felt his character needed but was just completely ignored in the ros  finn having a story line and not shoe horning in him being force sensitive would ve been awesome  proving that it s the choices we make  not our abilities that define us  rey getting a double sided lightsaber makes so much sense after her carrying the staff around for two  films  and it could explain her awkwardness and  luck  with a light saber if she genuinely came in and kicked ass  giving lando an appearance without completely relying on his off screen relationships saving the day would ve played better and probably been hype af  eod i enjoyed 7 amp 9 when i watched them and hated 8  and 7 s the only one i still enjoy  after watching and sitting on nine it just has too many holes and poor choices  their error was just putting too much trust in way too many people  the story s all over the place because there wasn t one a few confident and creative minds guiding the story  while directors could take artistic liberties with the production aspect  the actors did really well with what they had  i loved adam driver  it s a shame that john boyega was seemingly just used for promoting that they hired a black actor and was just thrown away after they proved how inclusive they are  i wish so much they would ve just let dave and jon do a thrawn series of movies  or would ve just left the series to end at episode six and introduce these characters hundreds thousands of years after the pt and ot  but i think that they decided that would ve been to bold for their first project 
1, deleted 
1,i don t get how people hate ros more than tlj  creating rose as a character and giving her such a large role automatically makes it the worst star wars film imo  worse character than jar jar 
1,what if we pretend that ros never existed and make a new movie 
1,the dark side is a blight on the force  that s why a jedi embracing the dark side is not balance  the dark side corrupts  its addicting like a drug  and it wounds the force  balance was found after the ot because the death of the sith 
1,go easy on the fortnite players
1,rey solana is a much better name than rey skywalkerfornoreason
1,it s certainly interesting  and i think it could ve worked well  however  i do think that the main issue with what we ended up getting is the lack of direction  as individual films  none of them are terrible  but i feel they don t fit too well together as a trilogy 
1,i dunno  i feel like the entire jedi religion is flawed because how easily people get banished outcast and become radicalized enemies of it  even as a kid i thought yoda and obi wan were wrong about things and luke was right about saving his friends family we even see luke use his emotions passions effectively numerous times he just doesn t give in completely i would have loved a sequel trilogy that redefines what being a jedi should be since the previous iteration failed miserably  they even made it a point in tlj that it failed again  the exact same way 
1,the  grey continuum  interpretation of the force entirely misses the point of george s story  it s not just an expansion of the universe beyond his original vision  it s a re definition of the story s core message  i don t like that  i never have  star wars is ancient mythology updated for modern sensibilities  that s what it has always been  the force is good and evil  it s not a  grey continuum   and you can t use dark powers without suffering karmic consequences for your actions 
1,what  you don t think some sith lord can t survive a massive explosion in space  it was totally set up in episode 8   s
1,you forgot his earing
1,maybe  anyway this isn t about the skin colour  it s about those god awful hair do s  also the fact that episode just felt filler for being the final season of clone wars  anyway maybe there is some sort of payoff later in the season
1,the prequels making the jedi weird space monks who wear desert robes and act like vulcans and also forbid relationships    is always going to be annoying to me  like  why couldn t they just be good knights who can move rocks with their minds 
1,the series is predicted upon the idea that skywalkers are special because of their bloodline we don t know other jedi bloodlines other than palpatine now  in the film series   which now reinforces the idea that genetics matter 
1,ok so i read the dotf script and liked it a lot with exception of a few things  but man there is a siiiiick sequence in there where finn  rose  r2 and 3po have to go to the lower levels of the ruined jedi temple on coruscant to activate an old  analog  communication array because the first order has all communications locked down on coruscant  so they get there  activate it  and they uploaded a pre recorded hologram of leia asking the galaxy for help  from what i remember reading it had this  the beacons of minis tirith  energy from lotr  where leias message gets out and it s this montage of her hologram being received all over the galaxy on these dark worlds suppressed by the fo which are now being lit via this old   analog  comm system idk when i think about what that scene i get chills about could have been 
1,the dark side is fear  anger  hatred  deception  etc  if you train those things to be used wisely rather than respressed  you can have a dark side that isn t corrupting  maybe that s why so many people turn to the dark side for the wrong reasons  because when you repress your emotions they can become corrupting 
1,tlj is objectively just a bad movie  with serious problems with both plot  pacing and characters any  ideas  that movie has are just platitudes better done in other movies 
1,or if poe kissed finn
1,the actual answer is that luke became a jedi that fast out of necessity  ideally he d be trained for decades  but the light side played with the cards they were dealt 
1,the hux thing and solana thing both sound cool to me  i liked rey being a nobody 
1,i mean even the st had a better story at points  granted neither were top tier 
1, gt adored tlj don t kill me  kill him 
1,does it tie in smoothly with the ending of clone wars only ask because it was written using the notes for the ending and wondering if stuff changed 
1,they re probably m√©tis 
1,the prequels were a perfectly fine story they failed in execution  in acting direction  in finer script detail  in dialogue  among other things  but the story itself is solid  it has a coherent beginning  middle and end that tells a consistent narrative with appropriate story beats what lines from the ot do you think lucas took 
1,we don t know their bloodlines  what we know is that the skywalker family is key for their bloodline  which is the entire series 
1,it s not problematic in itself   he is like a  fallen bendu    in that aspect   he fits the problem is that he dies so that kylo achieve essence absorption   he should train kylo and them send him into a darkside temple for a holocrom of an ancient spirit to teach that       
1,i m 26 and was watching reylo compilations on youtube like some hormonal tormented teen and was really excited for a classic forbidden love and what we got was      that 
1,tfa was a soft reboot of anh  so any  ideas  in that movies were just repeating anh tlj was a mess of a movie  where the  ideas  were either dumb or just platitudes thinly disguised as something  like   really deep  man tros was the movie with the fewest ideas  which is probably because it spent much of the runtime undoing tlj 
1,it s similar to  solano   which means  east wind   metaphorically  the wind of destruction and change  in spanish  not sure if that s something we see in her character  given that rey means  king  in spanish   reina  is queen   it would be a weird pseudo hodgepodge spanish combo  if nothing else  it s a nice name 
1,i m glad you didn t  the series certainly implied as much given the obsession over the skywalker family 
1,that is outrageous  it s unfair 
1,just being honest  and i m sure this will get downvotes  but i think dotf sounds just as foreign and out there as tros  neither are any good in my opinion  but that s just me 
1,everything he said is basically retold in the mortis arc of the clone wars
1,well  i hate it 
1,yeah but in the entire story 1 6 nothing happens to actually solve the problem of people turning to the dark side  they just defeat the emperor which puts the galaxy right back where it was and luke continues the jedi as how they were  there needs to be a fundamental change  and maybe seeing the dark side as a valid way to solve problems is the way to go  screw what lucas thinks
1,trevorrows script never addresses snoke  for me  snoke is one of the weaker points of the trilogy  to materialize a sith lord out of nowhere is a little uninspiring  additionally  it fails to address how ben solo was hearing vader s voice  from the way it s framed in tfa  it s ben s obsession with vader that fuels his decision to turn to the dark side  at least with  the palpatine resurrection  they provide some rationale as to how ben was turned  i think the sequel trilogy was irredeemable from tfa  i just found it to be totally lacking in imagination from the start and thus committing the trilogy down an all too familiar track 
1, deleted 
1,are you suggesting these 
1,right  that s why the skywalker line isn t totally key to the entire series and nobody wants to know who anakin s father is and why the emperor is totally not obsessed with skywalkers  etc 
1,  
1,same 
1,i m not afraid to say that disney and lucasfilm 100  missed the mark by not doing this  while there are things that could have been improved  it has so much more than what we got 
1,they cover that a lot in the ot   and reinforce it in the pt the force has always had a link to genetics   it isn t everything but it is a factor luke   the force is strong in my family   i have it  my father has it   my sister has it  qui gon asking shmi who anakin s father was because he was so strong in the force it must be a powerful father that sired him it s always been a thing  not sure how you ve missed it 
1,i know i m in the minority with this opinion  but duel of the fates was an awful script and kathleen kennedy was correct to ditch colin trevorrow  i didn t like tros either  so i m not advocating for one version of episode ix over another  but dotf was  not  the solution  harnessing the light and the dark misses the point of what the dark side even is  you can t harness it for good  it s just not possible  the biggest problem of the sequel trilogy  was  that they had no plan 
1,dammit 
1,yes   like snoke   but greater it s like someone that trained on the time period of bendu   but had fallen 
1, gt 	blood doesn t define you while that is true to some extent  the sw movies show otherwise   we can even look at just the sequels as an example rey having palpatine blood explains her origin story  after all   tros main premise is her bloodline being that of the emperor and his main motivation in returning she almost takes the throne to claim her birthright  it was only when ben solo came that she changed her mind in the end  to me  it was more like  this one blood line that i don t like doesn t define me  so i ll pick this other blood line instead and call myself a skywalker 
1,agreed  i thought i would be so happy when they finally kissed    nope 
1, deleted 
1,yes but in my limited experience with grey jedi is that they don t have a formal organization and just do what they want  i mentioned in another reply that with what i proposed  media post sequels would be focusing in exploring the force and other factions  with that  maybe something that could have explored the difference between my non episode 9 and the actual grey jedi  oh well 
1,i mean i don t mind unhealthy relationships in movies  i can see how they d be a bad influence on young teens  but i wouldn t get mad at her falling for someone who was cruel to her at one point  i see how people wouldn t like it though 
1,saying that acting and sets are good is meaningless yes  there are a lot of talented people in hollywood character and story is what makes a movie  and when you say that  the ideas are really solid   are you referring to tfa that straight up lifted the story out of anh 
1,we don t know that  we never actually hear the prophecy whos to say the jedi interpreted it correctly  palpatine clearly believed it yet recruited anakin anyway so id assume he had his own interpretation of what the chosen ones destiny is i d be happy if we never hear the prophecy and leave it open ended
1,honestly  they do a terrible job of flushing out rey  finn  and poe as characters  i feel like most of what i know about them comes from tros  or novelizations  or other canon  i feel like luke  han   amp  leia pull you into the origional trilogy far more because we learn so much about them when we first meet them  we don t spend 2 1 2 movies asking who luke s parents were  or who han worked for before the rebellion  or why leia was the one carrying the death star plans 
1,it wasn t so much that they were flawed because they didn t embrace the dark side  but that the way their teachings had evolved to remove all sense of humanity in an effort to block out the dark side was based on their fear of it  thus blinding them to the existence of the dark side all around them  it wouldn t have been that rey used both light and dark  but that she understood that outright rejecting and denying its very existence was not the way to overcome it  there was a balance in acknowledging the darkness within but not succumbing to it 
1,supress 
1,ahh  he probably gets slaughtered by ben 
1,specifically  no   it was clearly something to put on the extended universe however   thematically   even if her parents were force sensitives   she wouldn t had a  pedigree  like the skywalkers 
1,complaining about the romance part that no one actually made  true star wars fan right there 
1,the senate will decide your fate 
1,but never a master
1,see and i m just the opposite  i m not a huge fan of 7 and 9  but i really like 8  you re right  they re not that bad at all
1,i mean the father seems totally grey to me and he is canon right  a force sensitive person who can balance light and dark does seem like it can be a thing 
1,to me they failed from the get go when they made the first order the dominant force despite the fall of the empire years ago  they just wanted the heroes to be the underdogs again when it could have been way more interesting imo if they had the first order as the weaker force overall who rise from the shadows slowly through the 3 movies  but they instantly made all achievements of the original trilogy obsolete and made han  lea and luke look like idiots who didn t accomplish anything 
1,its almost like he s human and not consistent or infallible 
1,they don t appear to be black to me  look more hispanic  meh that s irrelevant anyway  it s the hair that is shit not their skin colour
1,never said anyone uses them in harmony in terms of both the light and the dark being balanced  both luke and snoke explain it s a cycle with such lines as   darkness rises and light to meet it   the light being rey s  awakening  and becoming kylo s  equal   it s the focus of all the luke and snoke scenes in tlj 
1,40 torr vacuum
1, gt but i actually don t think that s entirely the case  you see  the  biggest criticisms i see are that there was no real plan on where to go   that kathleen kennedy and iger rushed them outbut    that s literally what happened  that s what  you described   trevorrow worked on the ix script and planning for at least two years prior to his firing and  as you point out  the script was hinted at by additional media  filming had also  already begun   we have leaks of the old content   he was fired  the script was scrapped and a completely new story had to be created in the remaining time  where the trevorrow script would have been able to spend all that time producing and fine tuning they literally had no real plan where to go  because they scrapped the plan and started over again  i ve also heard nothing about the fisher rumour  every story on the topic claims it s because kennedy didn t like him his script 
1,i don t think anything short of a complete rewrite could save reylo  they wrote it so that a poor girl develops stockholm syndrome and falls in love with a guy who literally tortured her  held her captive  and killed his own father her friend in front of her in tfa  and she falls in love with him despite only having a few conversations with himunless they made kylo less of a psychopath  there s no way that doesn t sound insane 
1,he just ran around yelling rey  for no real reason
1,idk man i kinda like tros better than this  i like try being a palpatine  i m a weirdo and prefer reylo than rey and poe  sure it s not a revolutionary film  but it is one of the most fun over the top star wars movies and i love it for that  i like jjs films and overall my opinion of the st has been slowly improving
1,as people have already said  difference between the honorific  master  which even obi wan uses with yoda as a council member because they recognize those kind of apprenticeship  lineages  like in martial arts        anakin passed his knight trials in the 2003 animated series  and most knights trained 2 3 padawans before being granted the rank of master 
1,like a poe finn romance 
1,my bad  meant st  hate acronyms 
1,agreed  grey s aren t jedi  they are something new  or something old again come around 
1,the legacy characters deserved better the new characters deserved better  luke would not given up on his nephew  sorry but i don t see that happening 
1,so  basically going back to the jed ai    i thought rey was going to be a balance of both forces  the father   especially with tlj trajectory    a more ironed out version of dotf would have been good  alas 
1,found another fellow old timer   
1,so true by the end of anh luke  han and leia have such good chemistry that their friendship is 100  believable and established right when esb starts you watch esb and you just know that these three would do virtually anything for each other there s no sense of that in the st 
1,just strikes me that the two common criticisms are over two black characters having hairstyles common to black culture  and holdo having dyed hair as some sort of comment on  sjw  women  so mentioning hairstyles seems loaded 
1,the skywalkers got a ridiculously depressing ending anyway  with all of them dying relatively young after failing to accomplish anything with their lives   so while dotf isn t any better in that regard  it also really isn t any worse 
1,yeah i wish they either would have skipped the romance or fully developed it  that kiss was really cringey 
1,you mean the novelization of the phantom menace talking about darth bane   everything thats mentioned is confirmed canon in the clone wars   i believe the episode is called sacrifice   its the one where yoda learns how to become a force ghost 
1,that s part of what i was hoping for the sequels  it was time for the jedi to end  but not how luke saw it  then  media set post sequels would be exploring the force and other factions  while more classic stories would be set anytime before the sequels 
1,op literally says  i don t care about what s faithful to star wars  in a comment the st is literally inconsistent and not compatible with star wars canon  it s fine if that doesn t matter to you and you enjoy them  but those movies fundamentally misunderstand star wars
1,i fully agree with you  dotf sounded unique  and would have been a better and more definitive conclusion to the saga than tros  the st would have been learning from failures  and growing beyond  it would have given the jedi a new interpretation  as opposed to their dogmatic views of the pt  an understanding and appreciation of love  without ignoring it  not being able to love caused the creation of vader in the first place i don t agree with people saying this would have been contradictory to lucas his views  i think accepting the power of love would have been a triumph for the light side  rejecting love is the path to the dark side  as the pt jedi proved

1,yup   someone with a negative response is more likely to complain about something than someone with a positive response is to praise something   and people are also more likely to notice negative comments than positive ones   if you look at something on amazon and see 5 positive reviews and 1 negative review  the negative review is likely to have a disproportionate influence on your opinion i like the sequels   i don t think they re amazing  but i do think they re enjoyable films 
1,the kor and the guards are just henchmen in the grand scheme of things  maybe the knights of ren scene would have been more impactful if they actually build up those characters better  in both situations if rey hadn t been there he would be dead 
1,wrong
1,     „ÉÑ    
1,what is coded  i mean it is subjective whether one likes a certain hair style to me it s meh  each to their own though 
1,honestly  i ve read the entire script for duel of the fates when it leaked ages ago and i was seriously unimpressed  as someone that loved the sequel movies and the ending we got  i felt duel of the fates was a shoddy mess that didn t really tie into any of the previous movies at all  also  the darksaber isn t mentioned once in the script so don t know where you got that from  i will say that the stormtrooper uprising and finn leading it on coruscant would have been cool  but also that finn had a very similar arc in tros anyway with janna and the other stormtroopers so it wasn t really a missed opportunity  though i agree finn s arc could have been stronger   overall i still don t really think that disney had planned anything properly and i feel a lot of fans would have been very pissed with duel of the fates if it was the finale of the franchise  sure  you could argue a lot of people weren t happy with tros and felt it was too fan servicey  but if you ask me as a finale to a decades long franchise it s supposed to be  also  poe and rey being a thing    that shit still doesn t sit right with me  thank fuck they didn t keep that quite frankly 
1,yes they did  you shouldn t try to correct someone when you dont know what you re talking about
1,the entire series had zero direction and no proper arc because rian johnson is a dipshit   tfa was a great 1st movie to introduce 3 new characters   rey   poe  and finn  to contrast the 3 main characters of the first trilogy tlj disk build off of anything and didn t go in any direction  and  so that by the time the 3 was being made it was a scramble to try and tie anything together at all let alone everything together   i don t see any winning scenario tros could have had 
1,honestly  7 and 8 were fine for me  nothing too crazy  could ve developed planned the characters more  but i guess they were fine  my main issue comes with ep 9  this movie completely destroys the story that the original 6 set up  the original 6 are set up to show the redemption of anakin skywalker  he goes through his struggles  turns to the dark side  and then redeems himself by  killing  palpatine and going back to the light  force ghost   having palpatine be alive completely ruins the entire redemption  imo   on that same note of palpatine  having rey be a palpatine was just off to me  if she was made a kenobi like originally planned  it would ve fit with the story of the original 6  kenobi and skywalker just my thoughts
1, deleted 
1,why was this deleted 
1,it ruined solo too i believe  people were extra hard on it unfairly since it came out right after  it had the potential for a few good film arcs
1,nope  especially not in star wars  the second death star  larger than the first  was constructed in less than four years 
1,true the camaraderie and friendship between han  luke and leia was so important in the ot in the st the friendship between the new trio was a real hard sell  why would poe care that much about rey and vice versa  they barely knew each other  likewise poe and finn  they spent a few minutes together in the beginning of tfa  and then saw each other again at the end of the movie in most of tlj  as always the problemchild of the trilogy  they re apart from each other  so why are they so close again in tros for these  and many other reasons  the friendship between the three jusy doesn t work in the same way it did in the ot  and the st loses a lot on that account 
1,to bw fair  the duel of the fates script opens with rey and her friends stealing a star destroyer which housed a large arsenal of weapons  fighters and ground assault vehicles  leia s plotline involved recruiting people from across the galaxy using luke s death as a rallying cry  and finn s story involved him leading an uprising of civilians and a stormtrooper rebellion on coruscant that would have overthrown the first order rey was supposed to be learning from the jedi texts  had constructed her own double bladed lightsaber  and was supposed to have been communing with luke s force ghost kylo would have been an absentee leader of the first order who would keep running off obsessed with sith artifacts  haunted by luke s ghost  he would have fallen deeper into his hatred ans quest for more power until it lead to his ultimate destruction  also  he would have finally come face to face with and fought vader in a scene similar to the cave fight on dagobah all of these points would have been succinctly addressed by the duel of the fates script  but jj tossed it out without even reading it and just did his own thing and decided not to bother with all the setup from 8  he even talks about how it was like he was making episode 8 and 9 at the same time 
1,it s not  op doesn t know wtf he s talking about  force sensitives were never about genetics and family lines
1,terrifying   calm down 
1,it  is  a cartoon and isn t it weird that filoni is praised for the things people like  but when it s something they dislike  suddenly  disney demanded it  also  people seem to have a remarkable preoccupation with the hairstyles of certain female characters  feels   coded 
1,i wouldn t have minded the world between worlds if it just gave visions of the past or something  but the fact that it allows ezra to interact with the past doesn t work for me  time travel is a no no for me in star wars  and the way they used it to save ahsoka felt like a cop out 
1,i think he meant  suppress        
1,it makes me so angry that all of this potential wasn t realized  the sequel trilogy could ve been an incredible ending to the skywalker saga but instead we got this abomination of a trilogy 
1,frank oz does both grover and yoda 
1,i still don t like it  the movies were badly paced  introducing new characters that were leading to nowhere and misdirecting the attention of the viewer  besides  it s still disney s lucasarts fault for making us trust that  in the end everything will make sense  if the road to that end doesn t make sense  if this finale you say ever aired  maybe the story would be whole  and maybe the arc would be complete  but the journey would still have been mediocre  take the mandalorian  for exemple  it s obvious since day 1 that it s leading up to something big  the producers have given us a lot of clues to where to point out attention and our imagination  without giving away too much  and every character that s been introduced has accomplished their function without having to be the plot changer of the year besides  the talk of light side and dark side  i don t like it either  the star wars univers makes it very clear  the dark side is not about using it or not  the dark side is corruption  the balance isn t about using it or not  is about being able to feel those things that make people fall in the dark side without having to fall in it  and bearing in mind that the dark side will always be there  and you will have to always battle it  that s what i learned from mortis arc  you can t beat the dark side  you have to always fight to not let it control you  but it will always be there  that the jedi should always and only use the light side is undeniable  the lightest use of the dark side corrupts everyone with time  what should be about is reviewing what makes a jedi  and how can one fight his own dark side  isn t that the theme of the prequels  the jedi were so lost and so deep in their own traditions that they were unable to see the dark side rising from underneath them i ll look into that duel of the fates thing  but it still doesn t convince me 
1,nope  because it breaks star wars to have force ghosts physically effect things 
1,i have to disagree  but i see your point  the lightsaber is a jedi weapon after all  and there are  deleted scenes where yoda trained luke with a lightsaber   plus  i am not gonna lie   when yoda pulled out his lightsaber in aotc  i and the rest of the theater went nuts  it was like when hulk bashed loki or captain america grabbing thor s hammer i think the problem is how yoda used the lightsaber  he was like sonic the hedgehog  it looked goofy  he should have used the force to use it and kick ass  like you said  we got pingpong yoda and corkscrew palpatine instead of a bad ass super force fight 
1,not to mention the grey jedi stuff which lucas was against  and filoni would never allow 
1, gt what s the cylindrical mesh droid on castors to the right    sith lord burial place    
1, gt because they don t careor maybe they simply don t agree with you  saying that st fans aren t real star wars fans is just gate keeping nonsense that adds nothing to the fandom 
1,i think we should clear something up because you keeps using some words somewhat wrong plot equals events that happen story is how characters react to those events i personally am of the belief that story is far more interesting than plot the first order resistance is just plot dressing  i care far more about how rey  kylo  luke are dealing with issues than i do the relative military might of some fraction 
1,without spoiling anything once the story plays out you can at least see the the reasoning for the diversion   it s all worth it in the end i feel that if the season had been full length the story with the sisters would have been better regarded 
1,everything you mentioned i never once noticed in these films  they are a sloppy mess and what pisses me off the most is how much potential they had  sure  recreating the magic of the ot is nearly impossible  but a freakin tv show with a fraction of the budget kicked the st ass in cohesiveness  something every good sci fi series has 
1,i appreciate the work put into this but it is absolutely way too over the top  it makes it look ridiculous 
1,christ  rey was supposed to harness dark and light   they wanted to make her an even bigger mary sue   
1,the sequels werent planned  they were thrown together by too many cooks in the kitchen  themes jump all over the place  the movies contradict each other  and there was a severe mishandling of the legacy characters  its cool if you like them  attacking someone personally for a movie preference is dumb  but imo these movies were held together with bubble gum and rubber bands 
1,most impressive   
1,and his point is that tlj hate didn t sink the trevorrow script 
1,i mean  lucas himself already  broke  the fundamentals of the force with the mortis arc in clone wars no   also while i find dotf to be dumb aswell  it still at the very least had better ideas that ros in my opinion and i wouldve at the very least prefer to take that shit and just watch for fun  because by the end i pretty much wouldve gave up on caring about the lore   tried doing that with tlj though with alot more at that time hype and was just left with disappointment and sadness 
1,fluent in over 6 thousand forms of feeding people
1,vader at least had reasons to turn to the darkside  the love for his wife  and to an extent for his children ben turned because reasons i guess 
1,check thingiverse could be printable  or ask your best buddy with cad to model one or thread one
1,i don t see how it was better than the ot  the ot had a far more concise story that didn t meander around 
1,he did beat the knights of ren as well as multiple praetorian guards 
1,as someone who enjoyed  2 3 of  the sequel trilogy it disappoints me how tros ended up  there were so many interesting ideas in the dotf script that follow the themes in the previous two movies  i wish we got to see more of the plot make it into j j  abram s episode ix 
1,personally  i find the idea of gray jedi too fan fictiony  i would have hated rey learning to master both  to me  the whole concept of gray jedi feels like someone trying to have their cake and eat it too  or that one kid at school who tries too hard to be unique or edgy  i m all for a jedi learning not to fear or repress their dark side  but rather to practice mindfulness  but that s different than embracing the dark side 
1,that doesn t make any sense  a construction project of that magnitude would take    eh  forget it  there s no point in talking about scale in sci if  is there 
1,who in tfa or tlj used both the light and dark side together in harmony 
1,what are you talking about
1,yeah  there were definitely issues that would need to be ironed out in duel of the fates  that said  i really like the idea of finding balance and avoiding the fear of the dark side  i would be down for a spin off about rey teaching finn and her students while incorporating what she learned from the failures of the past  if dave filoni were to direct write a story like this  he could do for the sequels what he did for the prequels  idk i just feel like there was so much wasted potential in the sequels   
1,didn t know about cinemascore  will check it out  thanks 
1,jenny nicholson read trevorrow s script   it s bad  it s real bad    trevorrow has a fundamental misunderstanding of lucas  idea of the force  the jedi  and the sith 
1,hahaha yeah  imagine if star wars had a character who d inherited flight skills of their father and who had newly joined the rebellion and got assigned to fly super important missions on their first day  and then quickly became rogue leader  hahahahaha how unlike the original movies that would be 
1,i love reylo too   has some serious pride and prejudice vibes which makes me very happy 
1,at first glance i thought tor valum was just some ancient and random species made for the film but looking at him again   he s an evil zeffo which has caused my mind to be blown  interesting 
1,r i p revan  you will be missed 
1, was his revival literally not   somehow palpatine has returned  
1,read the original thrawn trilogy   heir to the empire  dark force rising  the last command  even though there not cannon anymore they are the perfect start to reading star wars since they are the best version of the sequels 
1,i only know sw
1,i m not sure if you re replying to the wrong person  but i never even said anything about tlj  i m not sure what johnson got wrong about balance though  and i see nothing wrong with force ghosts interacting with the physical world 
1,but luke is a skywalker  plus had the two best teachers around     or something
1,what i always found funny about the whole  bring balance to the force  prophecy stuff is  he sort of did  there were only really ever two sith at one time while there were thousands of jedi  so bringing balance to the force should mean less jedi or more sith  seems to me like the jedi didn t know what the word  balance  meant lol also  i do agree with what op has said about the hypocrisy of the jedi  spot on dude 
1,did you see luke kissing vader at the end of rotj  no  then luke doesn t pass the  kiss your abuser  message
1,are you threatening me  master jedi 
1,have i   better at melee combat than luke  check   better pilot than han solo  check better at languages than c3po  check   ewok   better at believing in the jedi than luke  well  you pointed it out   these are all legitimate complaints for a character that doesn t work and a script utterly lacking genuine continuation of a story 
1, baby yoda   
1,ok  got it  thx
1,does the name solana have any significance 
1,this is why i think dotf is the superior movie  it has its fair share of batshit  wonky ideas  but it at least progresses the characters with where they left off tros just    ignores it all 
1,kotor 2 
1,funny thing is  he consulted on the mortis storyline too  he was involved with alot of the clone wars tv show content 
1,he never won any of his battles  rey beat him every time and snoke treated him like a joke 
1, unused concept art   it s red in this picture but i have also read that it was supposed to be maces purple blade 
1,but that s just it   st fans don t care about established star wars canon  they like the movies for what they are  which is fine  but then pretend to not understand why star wars fans hate them you ll never convince st fans that the sequels are bad using established canon  because they don t care 
1,still better last words than  oof  
1, just remember all caps when you spell the man name mando
1,i would have much preferred if kylo ren died evil
1,i mean  the reason i choose the arcs above that i did was because they specifically built on the arcs developed in tlj i don t think any of them are that hard to do within the span of a movie either 
1,yah ur rigth
1,it would ve been hard to set up without it feeling like an ex machina  cooper goes into the space library of bookshelves  that we had in interstellar it also would ve been a dumb place to culminate the entire trilogy with  its like if at the end of the ot palpatine  vader  and luke got teleported to final destination super smash bros stage and had a conversation with master hand  its just a lot to throw at people all at the end of a trilogy 
1,good points
1,if they had a series that followed the vader comic  the one where its literally after the big nooooo scene  he grabs palpatine with the force and palpatine shocks the shit out of him  its gets good as he follows vader get his sith saber and even see padme again 
1,like darth vader 
1,not really  if you ve watched rebels it ll give you extra context  even though rebels comes after the books in the timeline   should be pretty easy to jump in  it sets up thrawn almost as like a sherlock holmes type 
1,congratulations   you read a book 
1,also i see no other reason you d want to master both the light and the dark other than a lust for power  which means more dark 
1,nice work  looks awesome 
1,this is the worst part of the sequel trilogy to me  not that they re bad  but that they didn t  need  to be  the sequels have so many good ideas in them  but they just weren t executed all too well  especially in tros and duel of the fates  
1,jj is a battle toad confirmed
1,how
1,eh i mean they also admit or atleast rian stated that he was allowed to do whatever he wants with his movie and got the  just do what you want man  thumbs up by jj 
1,in my opinion the acting  visuals and characters actually was a bit better then in the prequels  the story writing however was a travesty   not only do the sequals completely make the events in the original and prequels meaningless  not only that but ep  9 completely failed to even be consistent and a logical follow up to ep 7  larry alone the earliest movies  top top it all off they completely failed to give a satisfying return of the original cast and while a rogue storm trooper and female lead had great potential they add well where wasted by what issa just a terrible story that added nothing of value to the existing universe  and to think they ditched the expanded universe for this 
1,whoa  this is     game changing for me  that clip makes me so upset that we got tros instead  what could have been
1,yes  and if you play swotr  that very concept is talked about in the onslaught expansion 
1,it s part of the star wars movie formula  same reason there s always some scene with an alien animal in every movie 
1,he wasn t overruled on using luke more  he s talked about how early drafts gave luke a prominent role but that he felt that luke overshadowed the new characters whenever he was in a scene and wanted more time to develop them  so his solution was to pretty much cut luke entirely 
1,sorry  this wasn t the point of my post  the point was we don t really know what the state of the galaxy is  people like to just assume a more negative interpretation of events  i think that is a natural reaction when someone doesn t like something  all i was trying to point out is that we don t know  personally  i don t care about the fractions in power  i think interesting stories can be told no matter what fraction currently exists  i care much more about the characters  their experiences  and their struggles but to each their own  totally understand if people care about certain things more or less than i do 
1,the novelization isn t the same thing  they may have talked and he had some input in the book written about the movie he made  but it is not the same thing 
1, deleted 
1,terrible direction  new bad guy you need to fear but no tension built up because at the first time of asking he whips off his helmet with no helmet hair issues and gets beat by an untrained novice the new bad guy is shown to be just a whelp with daddy issues  vader was powerful  kylo had a temper  just not in the same league  got better as the trilogy went on i suppose 
1,so like snoke     seems either way ep9 was trying to work around the concept of no longer having a great evil 
1,yes  johnson didn t do a lot of things right  but the one thing he did perfectly was setting up kylo as the main villain of the trilogy  but abrams wanted him to have a  redemption  so he was forced to come up with a different main villain in the last film  i think palpatine was added back just so kylo could have this moment
1,what do you mean  powers physically weak  or like emotionally weak  if the latter  it s how he is portrayed in the films  until the end essentially   if it s the former  i m not sure  do people say the former 
1,you have descended into utter silliness  i thought we were having a real conversation  have a nice day
1,i dont know about him but i wouldnt say that they are wrong just not as interesting of a concept as those  written after by someone else  
1,i agree  i do think it s funny that some people who like to hype up the tfa discount the fact that it was in essence a remake of a new hope with some new ideas sprinkled in  it followed pretty similar plot beats while setting up some interesting premises  but the ending absolutely sucks  tlj is my personal favourite because i love when a movie surprises me  similar to empire strikes back where they fail at so many things  luke is failing at his training  han gets frozen  things end not great for the protagonists  the theme of tlj is failure and overcoming it  the plans aren t supposed to work it s about persistence  star wars was never supposed to just be about the skywalkers  anyone could be a part of the rebellion and be a jedi so i loved that rey s parents weren t anyone important  and thank god they killed snoke he sucked as a character  people bitch about his death  but really what did we know about the emperor when he showed up  absolutely nothing  he just appeared  no back story prior to the prequels  no motivations and then vader kills him  he is literally just a plot device in the original trilogy for vader to return to the light  snoke is the exact same he s just something kyle ren must overcome but on the flip side he heads into the dark  if they had continued this subversion of expectations into the 9th film it would have been much more satisfying  instead disney and jj played it so safe that it was unbearable  rey being a palpatine and the emperor returning were the two absolute low points of star wars  bloodlines and other deus ex machina bullshit have no place in star wars  finn is a nobody and i agree he should have risen higher by the end  same with poe or jyn erso or any other protagonist that wasn t related to some palpatine  skywalker  kenobi etc 
1,how does one recognize weak fictional characters without projecting anything on them 
1,it was during a galactic war  look how countries push through military recruits during times of war with high casualties even today  imo  it is very realistic 
1,what would ve been good would be poe finn
1,kennedy produced mandalorian
1,see that s the thing  the script we got was an early draft that was written during production on tlj  i have no doubt that the weaker elements of the story would have been ironed out before dotf began production 
1,luke dogwalker killed me  now i m happily laughing as a force ghost
1,the franchise still prints money and they just announced a million new media projects  merchandise is still healthy  the stories and characters are still popular and fresh in the minds of young children today if it s a ruined franchise  then it s the most successful ruined franchise i can imagine 
1,no  he s saying that the movies were created in a vacuum and the universe has expanded way beyond the original intent of its creator  and the  current  state of that universe is one that doesn t fall into the bog standard light dark dichotomy unless you only look at it through the lens of religious zealotry star wars is much bigger than just the vision that created the ot  and it s all the better for it 
1,i think a competent filmmaker wouldn t have gone  we have so much ground to cover  let s waste the first hour of our movie going back and forth from new planet to new planet finding random artifacts that will lead us to palpatine   the pacing issues have nothing to do with how much ground they had to cover and everything to do with how poorly they used their time  that opening stretch could have been used to really grow and explore the characters  instead they just keep getting trapped into a series of chase scenes 
1,he s not obi wan s apprentice  obi wan just can t stop being a finger wagging nag   that s why it may have  seemed  like he was still obi wan s apprentice 
1,r greyjedihate
1, gt if a fraction becomes more or less powerful over the duration of 30 years i d hardly call that undoing  it s pretty normal for political movements to rise and fall just because something may or may not make sense  it doesn t mean it s a good story 
1,they didn t shoot anything for duel of the fates  the script   screenplay never got the green light from lucasfilm to get that far 
1,ohhhh look 1 difference  holy shit  masterpiece confirmed 
1,i like the idea that he d only remember djarin s loving face in a similar way to leia with padme 
1,i disagree about mortis  the son murders his sister creating discord  without him  the father and daughter would have lived without conflict 
1,people always say this  but i just don t agree  we see plenty of jedis in the prequels that have no specific or special bloodline  this was never a point that needed to be embodied  or even made at all 
1, gt  yea its pretty interesting that the jedi have a prophecy about a chosen one who will bring balance to the force and they think that means  destroy the sith because that s what it means  and that s why he at last fulfills his destiny when the sith sidious is destroyed and jedi return 
1,a good example of a gray jedi is mace windu  who taps into his anger while fighting but does not let the dark side consume him  the dark side taints its users and ruins them  you can t master them both  i m one of the rare sequel haters that actually likes rey as a character but i don t think they should ve done her like that  it just doesn t make sense 
1,thank you  reading that leaked script was a gut punch  is it perfect  no  there s a lot i take issue with  but by god  does it feel like the ending they envisioned for this trilogy  on top of what you mentioned that was building towards it  lucasfilm themselves confirmed that the books were building towards this film too  disney had a plan  they had a vision and they threw it out because one movie was divisive  attack of the clones sucked ass  but george didn t change revenge of the sith in response to the backlash and it made the trilogy fee worth it  i know it s probably too late  but if lucasfilm and disney pulled a snyder cut and made dotf as the real episode ix  i would be there day 1 
1,yeah my favorite part of jedi is when vader tries to convince luke to join him after killing palpatine
1,no  the main characters of the original fiction are never the main characters of the fan fiction  how else is the audience supposed to know how cool and awesome and totally rad our oc is 
1,sounds a great premise for a series or even spread across a 3 part trilogy  but not for whats meant to be the finale of a 3 part trilogy and close of the  skywalker saga the kylo and luke idea couldve worked very well for 9  but all the rest should ve been done in tlj at least  instead of have that set immediately after force awakens with no room for character development 
1,kylo dying evil would have been a ridiculously depressing end to the skywalker  solo  bloodline for the saga  not sure it would have had the pay off people think it would have in the long run 
1,it s a trap 
1, deleted 
1,   i don t know what i expected 
1,i mean  darth bane was a creation of george lucas   the character s first appearance was in the novelization of the phantom menace by terry brooks   brooks in an interview said that him and george had a long conversation about the backstory of the sith which included bane and the rule of two   also george was part of the clone wars which all but explicitly says that both sides are the same living force 
1,wow have never seen these  thank you 
1,those scenes just don t hit like they used too  silly pre ads
1,it makes more sense if rey kissed finn 
1,the sequels brought shame to the franch  that is all
1,harnessing both the light and dark sides of the force is an interesting idea   the dawn of the jedi comics and novel within the legends eu explored that idea a bit 
1, gt tros plays like if they went to reddit and just took some fan theories and threw them together thinking that would somehow make a good movie that s literally what they did 
1,yeah  that s   odd  like we saw more chemistry from rey and ben  we saw more from rey and finn  hell  we saw more chemistry from finn and poe 
1,i never thought that the force was genetic before the sequels came along 
1,thank you  if no one else was gonna say this i would have  while i agree with many of the differences trevarrow originally had for duel of the fates the controlling both is not what star wars is  its one of the things that sets it apart from other fantasy franchises  where it s all about using both  but in star wars it actually is black and white and so one can t use both 
1,somehow
1,i mean the bromance between poe and finn is awesome and it doesn t feel forced  they even handled a relationship well in their own movies 
1,honestly i m starting to try and pretend those films are expanded universe  all three have aspects i absolutely love and i ll watch them over and over the rest of my life probably but we could have had way better films 
1, gt that last movie ruined the whole sequel trilogy for me and i will never stop blaming tlj haters for it it s disney that changed it  disney chose to listen to the  toxic  sexist  amp  racist manbabies   if a bunch of fans hate your movie  the damage is already done  move forward and actually achieve something rather than spend half a movie retconning the damage and not doing anything else 
1,first  luke s was short for lucas  nothing that deep there plus  he does believe in kylo  like vader  the difference is vader liked luke and vader found the first bit of happiness in a long time once he found his son  kylo hates luke to his core  that s a pretty big difference the movie thus basically asks the question  what would luke do if he knows that anything he tries to do will only make things worse  and  what if luke also felt responsible for a situation he knows he can t fix the answer is how he chooses to leave to make sure things don t get worse  hoping kylo can figure it out  as that s what is best for ben 
1,i think the entire series whiffed by basically starting out with a brand new empire  essentially negating the entire ot and pt i will insist until my dying day that they should have gone with a powerful asymmetrical enemy using horrific terrorist tactics to destroy the new republic  perhaps some sort of dark force cult  worshipping vader or palpy  or something  essentially  you d have the ot in reverse   at least in the first film  lots of great potential there for new republic leaders to struggle with becoming just like the empire as there are calls to put the hammer down and crush the new enemy alas 
1, broom boy   love it 
1,i enjoyed tfa a lot when it came out and was really excited for what the sequel trilogy would bring  i was disappointed by the outcome  the first six movies had a very concise storyline and overarching themes but the sequels just didn t really seem to fit into that  they didn t feel like the skywalker story like the others did  the prequels were about the fall  and the original trilogy was about redemption  what were the sequels about  balance  was it balance when palpatine returned and invalidated anakin s legacy  i was just so upset how it ended and how it didn t really have a clear storyline with a clear endpoint  what do we take away from the sequels  i feel like they never should have been made  or at least never have been part of the main skywalker storyline  they just don t fit 
1, gt  for all we know  that year between tlj and tros is closer to a civil war of an evenly split galaxy than a rebellion against an overpowered empire this was the part of your reply that really stood out  we    as and audience    are just supposed to assume all this  no explanation is given  it s just a return to exactly how it was in the ot  except somehow  the new republic doesn t care about fighting the fo  or even that the fo destroys an entire system  leia struggles to even have a tiny fleet  why  how did this happen  no one knows  we can only assume  so fans are left to assuming  well  if this happened this way  then yeah  it all makes sense   that s pretty poor storytelling 
1,in the name of the galactic senate of the republic  you are under arrest  chancellor 
1,this so much  rian johnson has no idea how the force works or what balance means and that s ultimately my entire issue with tlj  its so inconsistent with the rest of the universe  misunderstanding force balance  hyperspace as a wmd  force ghosts affecting the real world   
1,part of that is jj was the director for vi and ix  its his two part trilogy ha
1,it didn t go off in the direction fans had in their head cannon  but it started exactly where tfa left off  if you disagree  please tell me where 
1, deleted 
1,  
1,luke is not the main character of the sequel trilogy  i m sorry if you wish he was but that wasn t  part of the plan 
1,here my thought       the screwed up royally by playing luke to be some old burnt out hermit     didn t like it  didn t do it justice  kinda dumb    just didn t work  shoulda made luke to be a badass hero  shoulda had the knights of ten show up and luke mow them down ala what he just did in the mandolorian      i mean people are watching that and crying   that s the luke skywalker we wanted    and what we got was a depressed hermit  that s the issue 
1,wholesome lol
1,and yet nobody talks about how bad r1 was  or maybe its just me haha if tlj and solo were so bad that  fans  would boycott star wars and remove star wars from their lives  then they re not true fans imo the internet is just amazing in how negativity always swallows positivity
1,probably because a young girl kinda matched him in a  force off  when he was trying to extract information from her  and then also beat him in a lightsaber duel later  and different kind of  force off    all without any practice at all  that s probably why  he comes off as an emo wannabe sith  who isn t really threatening in the slightest  at least compared to earlier antagonists in the star wars saga 
1,that s a weird way for you to respond   unless you secretly wrote the script    sideeye   i got my eye on you  battletoads06 
1,where is that line from 
1,in my experience best way to learn something you half understand is to teach it to someone who knows less than you 
1,i find duel of the fates more interesting but i dislike it all the same  a sequel trilogy that extends the story that has already finished feels pointless anyway  it should have been something new  you can throw in the old characters of course  have luke be a grand master and the master of the main character or something  have leia be a jedi after getting sick of politics  i can kind of understand someone tapping into the dark since it is tied to negative emotions  but not actively using both  more of a slowly falling kind of thing as they use it more and slip further away 
1,i see where you are coming from but i think the die was cast when they tapped johnson for tlj the idea of multiple directors with creative freedom getting to helm different parts of a trilogy isn t going to end well unless you have a strong creative overseer  which they didn t  why not just get jj abrams to do all three  or at least have all the scripts done  or at least drafted or outlined  so you before you start  otherwise you end up in a dead end with your major villain dead and have to bring back a formally dead one at the last minute then there s johnson himself  why hire a director who openly says he s not interested in lore or nostalgia to make a star wars movie  other than lore star wars is just another space opera  today it s unique because we have forgotten the original battlestar galactica  battle beyond the stars  buck rogers and a pile of others from the late 70s and early 80s  it s like getting someone who hates shakespeare to direct romeo and juliet  then being surprised they want to subvert expectations but making it porn  as you described it dual of the fates sounds much better than what we got  but after tlj disney was in crisis mode  the kind of people who read an audience badly enough to green light tlj are not going to make better decisions under the pressure that followed it that s the real problem if you ask me 
1,duel of fates certainly wouldn t have been a perfect film  but it definitely would have tied the st together 
1,yeah   decent fight coreography didn t exist in america in the  70s   the old  kung fu  with david carradine had like no corography  just cuts of fists hitting their target 
1,is there anything i need to know or read before thrawn 
1,he is a trouble maker    i d vote for the great gonzo to voice him 
1,they shot no scenes for duel of the fates though
1,people complain about tros  but then you read treatments like this or alan dean foster s horrible resurgence  and you realize   it could have been a lot worse  
1, gt they also praise the dotf script for stuff like wielding the dark and light sides together tfa and tlj already hard established this anyway  so dotf had zero choice  i also think people praise it not for that  but that it s much better than what we were given 
1,completing the circle of bad fanfic  give everything from the main characters to your awesome new character to show how awesome she is 
1,there s also  master and apprentice   the qui gon obi wan centric novel where the topic of jedi prophecies is explored in some detail  though annoyingly  they do the one thing they really shouldn t have done    the  chosen one  prophecy is defined concretely  amp  x200b  gt   only through sacrifice of many jedi will the order cleanse the sin done to the nameless  the danger of the past is not past  but sleeps in an egg  when the egg cracks  it will threaten the galaxy entire  when the force itself sickens  past and future must split and combine  a chosen one shall come  born of no father  and through him will ultimate balance in the force be restored  like  how could any jedi read that and be like  yeah that sounds good for us   it says right there that bad things are gonna go down  but they only focussed on that whole  chosen one restore balance  part  plus some of this is just straight up gibberish   past and future must split and combine   what the heck does that even mean  more time travel  or is it a metaphor for luke and vader  the products of the past and the future  working together to defeat palpatine  or is it some vague allusion to the sequels and how the story repeated itself  man  i just bet the fandom menace crowd are gonna take this as yet more  they re gonna unwrite the sequels  conspiracy fodder 
1,i appreciate you writing this up and i agree this is better than what we got my problems with the st stem mostly from the universe inconsistency of tlj though  which nothing could fix after the fact short of a full retcon  hyperspace as a wmd  force ghosts affecting the real world  misunderstanding how  balance  works with the force  etc  
1,sequels were not that bad until tros  some people may not like tlj and i get it  but it did a great character development for every character  except for finn  poor guy  in it  tros threw it away  with palatine s return and a huge load of bullshit like rey s grandad and stuff
1,it did happen  you read it and can still read it 
1,i think you re absolutely right that dotf was clearly the ending everything was building toward  but i think that just goes to show how overrated having a grand  overarching plan is  because if the plan sucks  who cares  rey solana  dead evil kylo  rey and poe together  lucas scrapped his plans all the time  and was constantly changing his mind  the idea that star wars was entirely coherent until the st came along is just revisionist history  the issue with tros and i like a lot about tros is that it listened to angry fanboys  it actively undid the parentage reveal of tlj  and instead makes rey a  somebody   and thus we have to deal with the insane whiplash of   rey is a nobody and kylo is the big bad  to  nope  palpatine was around the whole time and rey s his granddaughter  actually  and her parents were nobodies  but only because the chose to be  blah blah blah   it s just super sweaty  i stan the st  but it s just messy as hell  and that s how every other trilogy is but over time  the inconsistencies just become accepted  leia was never intended to be luke s sister  but too bad  that s what it is  so you just have to deal with the fact that they kiss  and the weird scenes in pre rotj books where luke clearly has a boner for her  and now palpatine had a weird clone meatsack that he transferred his spirit to when he died  was it the plan  nope  but now that s a thing  and it s not going anywhere 
1,yes  i think that perfectly showed what was happening
1,doesn t mace windu use both light and dark in his lightsaber style  weren t there canonically gray jedi that used balance  the mysteries of the force can be whatever the writers wants it to be 
1,the thing i keep coming back to is that they should ve recast princess leia  it sucks to say it  but i feel like it would ve been better if they could ve given the character a proper send off  i feel that it would have been more respectful to carrie fischer to do it that way  as opposed to making compromises with leia s arc and using footage that had been shot before her death  of course  we ll never know what she thought of that  but i would imagine it would ve been more important to her that the character get the ending she deserved 
1,am i the only one who hates the have your cake and eat it too grey jedi ideology 
1,sounds like fan service
1,yeah  kinda like co dependency  but to be clear  that is my interpretation of attachments  someone else might tell you something different about having children  i don t think they re allowed but there was some exceptions like ki adi mundi  his species were endangered because they were very few males left  so he was allowed to get married and father children  that was in legends tho  i don t know if it s still canon  
1,it was a good opportunity for a time jump of a few years  like the ot did 
1,sorry  i should ve provided  the link for you  
1,luke in mandalorian is still 5 years off from starting his own academy  it s possible that grogu will go back to din before that luke said that he d help grogu understand and control his abilities  not train him as a jedi grogu already has some basic training and luke became a jedi in like 3 years 
1, deleted 
1,grey jedi are the worst concept in star wars lore 
1,except mortis and countless other stories have blown lucas  visions out of the water  we are no longer in lucas territory  he s gone  for better or worse anakin being wholly absent in the third trilogy and luke being in for basically 3 4 s of a movie is a bigger undermining of the entire franchise lucas had built to this point  it was the skywalker saga  now its palpatine s  idk  don t care  gonna go watch some mandalorian and forget this bullshit 
1,different directors would have been fine if they d had a consistent writer or writer s room even  but a lot of modern directors what to have their hand in their story because modern directing is as much about bringing your personality to the film as anything else 
1,i keep seeing it brought up in comments here so i want to clarify that from what i can find there is no  official  definition of a grey jedi people usually mean a force user that uses both light and dark side powers  without being corrupted by the dark side however  based on other definitions given  like in kotor ii   it s a person that has received full jedi training but has chosen to leave the order while still not being corrupted by the dark side  like ahsoka  either one is technically correct because both have been given as definitions from legitimate sources  however i don t think any canon source has given the official definition 
1,you mean the movies that introduced the force and were either made by or with input from the creator of star wars  vs books that were written after by someone else  you are saying the movies are wrong 
1,not gonna lie  first i laughed then i wondered for a bit now im sold  whenever you are ready disney  lets fix this shit 
1, dab or dab not  there is no try fam  
1,poe and rey didn t even talk
1,perhaps that kylo was not either jedi or sith they think he s weak he is the child of the daughter of anakin skywalker 
1,  
1,yes please someone de canonize the st
1,get ready for the people who think they can debunk your case in two sentences 
1,we re allowed to throw out lucas  stuff for better stuff  it has happened in star wars all the time ever since harrison ford was like  i m not saying that shit  george  its just in this case we threw out lucas  overarching vision and replaced it with something with no true central objective  i m going to go out and say that tlj doesn t even do a good job of setting up duel of the fates  it still feels like 3 unconnected movies  that s what happens when you waste your first big step in your trilogy re setting up the empire  the death star  siths that came out of nowhere  and luke s sentient lightsaber 
1,i don t think these people paid attention to the movie 
1,ur welcome 
1,you can even see the parts they actually shot  short pieces  but they are amazing 
1,i think you re spot on with this 
1,nothing s been destroyed  they exist in their own continuity also  by the way  lucas was going to overwrite the eu too  and already was in tcw  and he outright hated mara jade 
1,remember that all we have of duel of the fates is early draft stuff  this would have been worked out in editing before filming  had they continued with the trevorrow script 
1,i don t think the prequels did story well  lucas seemed to just take lines from the ot to use for rushing out a script 
1,yeah  but not in the way where u can scroll and look at literally all of them yk 
1,  
1,well we wouldn t forgive darth vader in real life neither and ben died at the end so that was his punishment for being a tyrant at least did something good before death 
1,we re going to need a lot of flex tape 
1,only thing i didn t like about the trilogy was that rey and kylo fell in love or whatever in predictable disney fashion  she should have killed him  he should have stayed a villain  why is that so hard to ask for 
1,the biggest problem i have with it is that they didn t have a solid plan when starting the sequel trilogy  all the directors tried to do something different which lead to one leaving  from the project and the other 2 not having the same vision 
1,that s too bad  cause the njo shouldn t have been destroyed   now mara jade  jaina  jacen  cant exist 
1,rey becoming a grey jedi is a terrible idea  grey jedi themselves are a terrible idea  george lucas and the new story group seem to both hate them and for good reason as they go against everything the force and balance are supposed to be 
1,i enjoy watching the mandalorian much more and i get the feeling i had as a kid when i watch rogue one 
1,obnoxious and loud moviegoers can t pee without missing movie big hassle compared to turning on tv  opening disney  app and clicking movie theaters are the entertainment equivalent of taking public transportation oh  and my tv won t demand i flash a vaccination passport  check my temperature or wear a diaper on my face  expect all those joys coming to theaters soon 
1,i don t know why but i came up with a better version of the sequels in my opinion  the first movie would introduce rey kylo finn snoke pretty much would ve kept it the same episode 8 rey trains with a not depressed luke and she abandons him then snoke seduces rey and turns into sith and joins kylo  episode 9 a few months past after rey became a sith while finn is trying to find  rey and bring her back  rey kills snoke blames kylo for the death and he s on the run to find luke and rey becomes supreme leader while kylo becomes to ben skywalker and trains with luke and joins the resistance and defeats rey at the end and ben being the rising skywalker the end
1,tlj did the damage  the rest of us just reacted  you can t have the main character of the ot shit his pants and die to be purely a diversion and not get a strong reaction out of people  and then never have his dad show up when the entire star wars galaxy is centered around him 
1,because he s not always shown with the same sort of strength that vader was  i d assume  vader is intimidating throughout almost all of the ot  whereas kylo shows vulnerabilities and conflict throughout his trilogy 
1,because they are weak themselves and project that insecurity on to fictional characters they claim ownership over 
1,jj set up several plot points and potential story arcs in tfa  rian  johnson ruined nearly all of them in the tlj  then they bring jj back for the final installment with all of the things he put in to play broken the issue with sequel trilogy was rian johnson and his abomination of a movie  how do you expect jj to make a satisfying conclusion when he only did the first and third movie  the second movie in trilogies really is the most important one  snoke who was easily the most interesting new character being set up as the  final boss  being killed in the most lackluster way possible in the second movie makes a massive void the emperor coming back really feels forced and is far from fluid   trying to make rey being able to wield the force in balance is a clear ripoff of revan with no story points to explain revan went from light to dark and came back to center  rey received no training or holocrons in the darkside and bare minimum in light side  she can use s tier force powers of both sides of force for no reason  all of this could of been explained in the second movie but the second movie didn t do anything except advance the story like a week 
1,easy  just continue the character arcs  kylo ren is dealing with being the supreme leader  running a galaxy  and most importantly  not being satisfied with it  kylo deals with ghost luke and they can work out their differences  first order generals perhaps don t like him and think he isn t stable rey is doubtful of her ability to fill the shoes of luke skywalker poe is dealing with how to fill big shows and lead a movement finn  as a now prominent member of the rebellion  could be struggling with how to fight people that were once his friends 
1,just started reading some sw books last week  beginning with thrawn  loved it  got the next two books in the series as well as a new dawn and ahsoka 
1,his point is jj wrote tros during the blowback
1,i think tlj was an overcorrection to tfa  the same way that ros was an overcorrection to tlj  unfortunately for the fans and franchise  disney chose to let two directors get in a dick measuring contest  instead of insisting on a clear  consistent  pre approved story  it was a trilogy mismanaged by neglect on disney s part  and egos on rian and jj s part 
1,yeah i definitely wouldn t want kylo to die evil  i think they should ve had him turn early in the movie and keep him alive so rey has some chance to be with the second half of her dyad  it would ve been cool to see hux die on windu s blade though
1,broom boy was thematically important  though  he was the embodiment of the idea that you don t need a specific bloodline to be special  that you could be  nobody  and still learn the ways of the force and the  tros just said   lmao no  palatine fucked 
1,so you can say the insufferable fans had a part in ruining the consistency of the sequel trilogy 
1,on wookiepedia theres s listsome of my favs  canon and non canon  are the valor class cruiser  starhawk battleship  virgilia class bunkerbuster  and b wing
1,it s poorly written   at no point in the prequels is anakin mature enough to teach someone else about the force  when he barely understands the force himself 
1,how about something different  know this one yes  it bears the semblance of an academy  but we are all the students  curious 
1,the theme of cycle and balance is the overarching narrative for star wars   seriously  look at what george lucas has said about it  the st does reinforce this  perhaps even too well 
1,now i really want duel of the fates but with the better aspects of tros  like kylo dying good 
1,the fact we have to refer to him as broom boy  basically proves your argument 
1,while i totally agree with you on his symbolic purpose to tlj  if i remember correctly the script does actually mention that a kid who plays a role in the battle of coruscant was the broom boy  i could be wrong though  since i haven t read the script myself  it may have been a youtube embellishing that bit  but i do seem to remember some direct reference to him 
1,very underrated
1,i mean yeah  but imo that s on disney lucasfilm  star wars fans are star wars fans and are very rarely going to be happy  they should have stayed the course
1,this  the highlights sound good  but op is leaving out a ton of details that wouldn t have been good at all  yet most people aren t going to realize that and start hating on the current sequels even more because of it lmao
1,i feel like star wars  the bad batch already fills the role of republic commando imperial commando  that being said  i wish we got to see more of delta squad in canon 
1, gt  itit what    tell us  
1,master   sign of respect to a jedi from a padawan or civilianjedi master   rank in the jedi orderedit  spaced out so it made sense 
1,as someone who could watch pretty much anything with the name star wars on it and be happy the biggest issue i had with the new movies is the same company who saw what a connected universe could create with marvel seemingly had no end game planned with sw  they basically dc ed themselves which is insane 
1,this is what the prequels have  because as much as i hate phantom menace and only watch the better parts of attack of the clones  it has an overarching story and purpose which you can t throw out  prequels  anakin becomes darth vader  obi wan becomes a jedi master  the empire rises originals  darth vader becomes anakin  luke becomes a jedi knight  the empire falls sequels       we kill off the original cast  bring back palpatine to have him murdered by his granddaughter    and     ummmm     bury a lightsaber  done  oh  and also the empire never really fell  and palpatine never really died  and who the fuck is anakin skywalker  we re a palpatine crew now  all my homies hate skywalker 
1,i think the biggest problems for the sequels happen in the last 10 minutes of the force awakens  rey finding luke and meeting him for the first time is great for fans to see and a really nice cap to the movie    but it leaves no amount of time to pass before tlj starts  where 1 2 and 4 5 have many years between each allowing for character growth and for pieces in the galaxy to move around  there are mere moments between the start of 7 and 8    that leaves a completely unsatisfying feeling where we can t assume that characters have grown and we don t see them grow either  8 could be a good story  just not immediately after 7 
1,one thing that people forget about the dark side that was established as far back as the original trilogy as to why balance isn t using both but rather wiping out the dark is the notion that the dark side is  effectively  temptation and  more importantly  corruption   even if you want to discount what lucas said about the force  as he tends to say a lot of dumb things about the universe now   it s been established repeatedly that the dark side will corrupt anyone it manages to take hold in   we of course have anakin as the clear cut example of this   we have ezra after encountering maul and the sith holocron  we have cere in jedi fallen order  we have luke on the second death star with him using his anger to overpower vader   you can t strike a balance with something that will corrupt  because that corruption  will  grow and spread until whatever other side there wise has been corrupted by the other   hell  the mortis arc in clone wars goes to highlight just how dumb of an idea that  mastering the light and dark  plot point is for dotf given what s already been established   the father  tried  to keep a balance between his children  which was so on the nose about being embodiments of the light and dark side that it flattened it   and what happened in the arc   the son killed the daughter  which then results in the father killing himself to prevent the son from getting stronger  and then the son is killed 
1,now i can t get that image out of my mind   darth vader in tightie whities with his cybernetic legs   
1,the children grew up and their love for the prequels became mainstream  the same process will happen with the sequels 
1,1  the rebels were facing death  they managed to barely escape because everyone was aware of the plan and not left in the dark about what the next move was  2  vader betrays the emperor at the last minute before seeing his son die  they didn t need to fight some dancing guards who s weapons are digitally  because no one on set noticed an obvious mistake 
1,because he s somebody s master 
1,the ot only gets a pass because it went first  all 9 movies are cheeseball popcorn flicks that people now put on a pedestal as sci fi gospel this is coming from someone who has seen every film at least 3 4 times each  with older films like empire getting to several dozen rewatches it s all bad but it s all fun  just enjoy it 
1, gt and for the most part  they don t actually undo anything from the movies that came before them the name   luke   means  bright  white    light    giving   that s what he was in the original trilogy    a source of light in a dark empire  he s the one who ultimately brings his father away from the dark side  and in the tlj  he s a grumpy old man with no light in him  when presented with a suitable apprentice who has his lightsaber and an opponent that he let go and luke knows is a threat to the universe    he resists training her or protecting the universe from kylo  he just  spongebobs  and says  ight imma head out  to let the jedi die  while kylo uses the training luke gave him  this is not an undoing the character of luke skywalker  yes  luke s sacrifice at the end redeems the grumpy old man  but with an active threat that he let out  shouldn t luke be doing something else than watching the grass grow 
1,like others said anakin is a jedi knight in episode 3  so he s not learning anymore from obi wan  at least not as a padawan  he just calls him  master  because he used to be his master  it s a sign of respect  second there s a difference between being a  master  to a  padawan  and being a  jedi master   the first refers to being a teacher  the second is a higher rank to the one of  jedi knight  
1,oh goodness   the premise of that movie sounds just as bad   
1,i belive he is also called master by other jedi a few times  for instance barris almost always and by luminara a few times 
1,thank you  i ve been listening to this on youtube for a while but it s so much better in spotify 
1, gt  tlj  love it or hate it  continued off of everything that was set up in tfa to say that tlj continued everything that was set up in tfa is a false statement 
1,  
1,agree with your analysis  but a couple things to add   there are contracts and various bits of legalese which dictate who gets credit for a script  and how much they get paid for that honor  the fact is  jj and bad robot don t like to share   gt  jj  could  have used the existing story treatments for either of his movies  michael ardnt s for tfa  colin t s for tros   but that would mean sharing production credits  for whatever reason  they   insisted   on total creative freedom for both movies   the only reason jj and bad robot were picked in the first place was their existing production line   gt  at the time  lucasfilm had been  gutted  and iger wanted a new movie unreasonably fast  so they let bad robot produce most of tfa over in their house   hence why we had so many leaks ahead of time   then  when ct was fired and iger still wanted his trilogy capper before his retirement  they turned to bad robot again to pump out a quick blockbuster  once again  jj insisted on total creative freedom  meaning he was going to ignore whatever existing lore he wanted to make  his  movie   also again why there were so many leaks  ultimately  it s not exactly laziness   gt  it s treating the ip like a throwaway commodity  thinking that fans just want  a cool movie  and not something deeply personal and rewarding 
1,like co dependency i do agree that attachment and love might be different things    are jedi allowed to have children   is there a thread for that 
1,thanks so much
1,it s a shame  the sequels good have been good  my rankings would bethe force awakens  8 10the last jedi  4 10the rise of skywalker  2 10
1,if a fraction becomes more or less powerful over the duration of 30 years i d hardly call that undoing  it s pretty normal for political movements to rise and fall  even in the eu  the new republic and new jedi order gets wrecked  plus we don t really know the entirety of what the state of the galaxy looks like at this point in time  you are making the assumption that the resistance is the only group willing to fight the first order  people didn t show up on crait because why save 25 people  it would be better to use your resources to protect your own planet  plus  the first order wasted all their time and resources following the resistance rather than making targeted moves towards other planets for all we know  that year between tlj and tros is closer to a civil war of an evenly split galaxy than a rebellion against an overpowered empire  even in tros the generals of the first order are complaining about a lack of troops and whatnot  so even your example of  undoing  is pretty bad faith
1,i love romance in films  i can t help it lol  i didn t hate reylo  i just wish it was done better 
1,trevorrow was fired and replaced before the last jedi even came out 
1,here s the thing though  the directors didn t write their movies in isolation  they all consulted with each other and all had some version of their scripts done while the previous movie was filmed  jj was a producer on tlj  he knew what was in the script even before tfa was released and approved of it  rian johnson even asked jj to make certain changes to tfa to flow into tlj better  the biggest being his request to put r2 on ach to so he could write his and luke s reunion   treverrow talked about working with johnson on his script  they didn t write all of these movies in secret and refuse to show it to each other  they literally just did not expect the backlash for tlj and hastily redid everything they had planned for the finale 
1,poe and finn forever  but disney doesn t have the balls to do interracial and gay on an international property 
1,my bad   my memory has deceived me
1, gt how many books there are  lots    too many to read them all  so i wouldn t even try   gt  was wondering if their is an order i need to read the booksif the books are in a series  i would obviously start at the beginning  but otherwise no  i usually recommend that people look for what interests them and start there   gt where to find themwherever you find books normally  local libraries  interlibrary loans  amazon  barnes and noble  audible  etc  they re all over the place 
1,yeah  it definitely could have used another once over
1,you will try 
1,because he s somebody s master  before he takes an apprentice  sio bibble calls him  master jedi  and padm√© corrects him 
1,thx  i m going to read the thrawn series
1,there is a difference between the rank of jedi master and being a master to a padawan  anakin passed the trials early in the clone wars and was promoted to the rank of jedi knight  he then was assigned a padawan  all padawans call their trainers master as a sign of respect  even after they ve no longer a padawan  it s why anakin still calls obi wan master in rots
1,does boba even know that his jetpack got hit by han  
1,oh yeah  sorry i wasn t remembering that correctly
1,i think they meant  suppress    that s how i read it  i didn t even notice it was  surpass  until i read your comment 
1,i get it why she could call him a master because he is her master but not a jedi master  but still he is called a master by other characters as well 
1,only a sith deals in absolutes  i will do what i must 
1,not really unless you re reading a series like the thrawn series  obviously you want to read those in order but for the most part they are spread across all time lines  i ll list some of my favorites if that helps  the thrawn series  4 books dark discipleahsoka bloodline master and apprentice  from a certain point of view i m sure there s a bunch more that are great but these are the ones i ve read and really enjoyed 
1,between aotc and the movie 
1,i loved tlj and liked tfa  i didn t even despise tros 
1,hmm it s been quite some times since i watched the prequel movies    i dont know   sorry   
1,of course i see the flaw in that buddy  that s one of the major points tlj is trying to make  and in the end luke sees the flaw in it too and sacrifices himself so that rey can survive and restart the jedi order free of the struggles and mistakes of his past order and the jedi before that
1, master  is both an honourific and an actual rank  anakin is her master in the same way obi wan is anakin s master in aotc  when he s still a jedi knight  a  jedi master  is a rank 
1,sola appears in  queen s shadow   about a year after the phantom menace  with her newborn daughter ryoo  ryoo also appears at the funeral in revenge of the sith and the deleted scene in attack of the clones  that is her only other appearance so far pooja  the other child who appears in the deleted scene and funeral  does not have any other canon appearances so far  i think it s safe to assume that she is still sola s daughter  but it isn t explicit outside of the non canon deleted scene in legends  leia was friends with pooja when they were both senators  and decades later learned that they were cousins  pooja was able to tell her about meeting anakin legends also gave ryoo and pooja a father   queen s shadow  does not have a father for ryoo and explains that it is common for women on naboo to have children  biological or adopted  without a partner 
1,also  i m sure everyone here is familiar with the redlettermedia reviews of the prequels  right 
1, check this video out by mr sunday movies   they go to the effort of animating it to give a clearer picture of it
1,i watched the movie but when does anakin stop being obi wan s apprentice
1,  
1,the script sounded good  and the art for it was amazing  but the actual details of it were awful 
1,i like them as individual films  not as a trilogy is how i see the sequel trilogy 
1,i ve been wondering the same thing for a while  and she calls him master too when he s not even a master yet in rots with the whole  you are on this council but we do not grant you the rank of master 
1,yeah ummm wtf 
1,i do think a future episode  movie or tv event at some point will definitely do future grogu it d be great to just actually see the jedi order reborn fully  not in its infancy trying to rebuild ala post rotj  or bizarrely destroyed again for no reason just to rinse and repeat the same struggle  tfa tros  like we ve seen jedi order at strength in the pt  let s see how it looks 500 years from now when order 66 is far forgotten pain and there are merely legends of luke skywalker 
1,he d passed his trials by then 
1,on the top of the cover of a new revan book there s the official  legends  disclaimer  if this disclaimer is absent it is considered to be within canon 
1,not really  in 2008 movie she is signed to him by master yoda
1,thanks  will do 
1, disney  series intensifies 
1,and you don t see the flaw in that at all  literally thousands of years of success  and vader becoming palpatines apprentice leads to the ultimate success of finally defeating the sith once and for all  breaking the sucession of master to apprentice  but luke is just going to give up it only makes sense in the context of reading luke in tlj as product promotion for rey and kylo  i have never seen so much power    rey and kylo are so great i don t know what to do  get real  it reads like bad fanfic  and might as well say  buy the new kylo ren funko pop  he s cooler than luke  
1,naw yoda literally assigned her to anakin 
1,he wasn t an apprentice anymore during rots 
1,wow  that actually would ve been fine
1,he didn t  master yoda assigned her 
1, gt instead of the star wars movie every year thing i d rather have them space the movies out more and focus more on showsthat seems to be what they re doing  at least in the short term  between now and 2027 we re getting 3 films while on the tv side of things we re getting 10 new shows in roughly that same amount of time 
1, gt  i just want compelling stories and gray jedi compel methat s fair  my comment was more towards sequel haters as a whole  which i m aware you re not one of  who talk about how cool dotf sounds personally  i don t mind pushing the boundaries of what star wars  is  from time to time  the world between worlds was cool for me  and i really liked the concept of the force dyad  but i think some things are fundamental  and i don t really see the main character of the trilogy wielding the light and the dark in harmony as anything other than breaking the fundamentals of lucas s star wars 
1,i think it was explained in the tcw movie   but not sure  i believe it was a unique part of his training   not something other padawans get
1,episode 7 is considered just a remake of episode 4  while that is an exaggeration for sure  there s some truth to it  that s most people main gripe with the film  i don t need to explain season 8  i think you already understand why some fans don t like it  episode 9 was pretty messy and went against things episode 8 set up  mostly i hear that the st lacked planning  you could say the same about the ot and the pt  but in the end both worked out better than the st 
1,yep  the new battlefront is fun 
1,he s not obi wan s apprentice in rots 
1,i do agree that tlj is somewhat inconsistent in the sense that if tfa was a straight line  because it was literally a blank slate of star wars  i would say tlj took a left turn from that straight line  yeah it s different but it s not super incongruent  but then tros took a 180 degree right turn  which totally takes the story of the rails 
1, deleted 
1,he isn t still obi wan s apprentice in rots  he s a jedi knight 
1,yeah  it felt like ahsoka reading a book about herself someone else wrote 
1,keep in mind  the script that was leaked was still an early draft that would have evolved more before filming  even if carrie fisher hadn t died  its hard to say whether the flaws of this script would have been worked out or improved by the time we got the finished movie  maybe it turns out really great  or maybe it doesn t  but i feel like building off this script could have led to a more satisfying conclusion than what we got with tros 
1,tbh i never understood that either 
1, gt  so luke turns against his only blood  because he senses a darkness in him   but trains rey   who is a palpatine he momentarily reacts to a terrible vision of the dark side  because ben had already fallen by then  and he mostly  doesn t  train rey  but she hasn t fallen to the dark side  blood doesn t define you 
1,tlj  love it or hate it  continued off of everything that was set up in tfa  if it d been written like tros  it would of started with a scroll that read   after luke skywalker told rey to leave him alone  the rebels decided to build their own death star to fight the first order      but it didn t do that   it respected where the previous story left off  tros didn t even try to do that 
1,i m hearing this with a scouse accent
1,going on from this  i really can t see where 9 was meant to go after last jedi  there was no cliffhanger  all the mystery boxes had been made irrelevant  and solo bombing so hard meant disney had to do anything to try and win those lost fans back 
1,those movies were really just a very vivid force vision into a possible future leia had if she doesn t make han pull out  then she does and now we can move forward with the legends timelines 
1, gt but do you think it s reasonable for people to see tlj as incongruous with tfa  or the sequel trilogy to be inconsistent with the pt and ot  i think there are valid criticisms of tlj  but not enough that would warrant the complete 180 in ros  that last movie is the one that made the st completely incompatible with the rest if the trilogies because of the chosen one prophecy meaning nothing  and on top of that  compmetely ruined the message about not having to be born special to be powerful i can accept the criticisms of luke trying to kill kylo  but him isolating himself due to his mistake is hardly incongruous my point is that the valid criticisms of tlj could have been addressed differently i dont think rey had to have important parents  luke has shown weakness before  like in roj  criticisms about these two things got an irrational amount backlash 
1,  
1,there s some novels  i think the bane series  explore the nature of the force a fair bit more and i really  really  like the subtext that s in the books basically  there is no  light side  or  dark side  it s all just the force  it s all the same energy   jedi and sith are conduits for it  and the only difference is temperance self control basically  since the sith don t give a damn they allow more of the energy into themselves and are stronger for it the movies focus too much on the dark and the light  as if they re two different sides of the coin   but there is no coin 
1,agree with this but i remember most people already said that dotf script would be better but i am not sure because watching a movie is different than looking at the script also dotf while thematically follows tlj well  visually is inconsistent with ep7 and 8 because it s looks like a modern prequel era film with coruscant and mortis 
1,  
1,my least favorite character is that purple haired crone in tlj who hides the plan from poe for no reason  which inspires him to mutiny  and then declares  i like him   again  for no reason  the best thing she did was die 
1,yea its pretty interesting that the jedi have a prophecy about a chosen one who will bring balance to the force and they think that means  destroy the sith that to the jedi  balance meant  letting the jedi have a monopoly on the force   they bought into their own hype so much they couldn t conceive that they could be beaten or weren t the rightful masters of the force 
1,yeah 
1,a lot of people like them  a lot of people dislike them  negativity often elicits a stronger response though  so you re going to hear a lot about why people didn t like them 
1,no  the empire just mines the planet  creating the trench  it s the first order that finds it later  because they ve got access to imperial records  and turns it into starkiller base 
1,i agree  after reading the book and playing the n64 game  i always wanted a shadows of the empire movie on that topic  when i read the book  the description of dash rendar made me picture him as conan o brien   
1,haha sequels bad lol  yeah i m not reading all of that
1,how do we know that book is canon and the revan book  and others  is no longer 
1,to piggyback off of what most folks have said  the prequels are super respected now because the people who were kids back then grew up watching them and see the st as inferior  ironically the folks who were kids when the ot came out despised the prequels in their heyday  i could chalk this up to saying things tend to get better with age and people maturing and calming down 
1,i haven t read them but i know they re doing new books and he has also appeared in a show  i won t reveal which for spoiler purposes 
1,i have come to accept the successes and the failures of the sequel trilogy  i absolutely believe that lucasfilm did have some rough outline of what each film would be  leaving enough room in the story of each film for each director to put a spin on things  as for episode 9  the loss of carrie fisher total crushed duel of the fates leaving trevorrow with an extremely difficult task of rewriting the final chapter of this trilogy  on top of that we have the massive hate that tlj received  it s was a recipe for disaster  so they went with the safest avenue  bring back jj to try and please some angry fans  with hope that maybe they could pull off another tfa  what we got was a mixed bag  a movie with some enjoyable moments and some flaws  the sequel trilogy is not to different from the prequel trilogy in that way  it s hard to say if duel of the fates would have been better then tros but it probably would have fit better in terms of one continuous narrative 
1,how did they redo thrawn  i m unaware  ironically i m in the middle of the first book of the thrawn legends trilogy 
1,every time this is reposted i say  the point of the confrontation isn t a flashy showcase of jedi ability   which neither had at this point in their lives   obi wan simply tactically held off vader long enough for lhl to escape   once that objective was accomplished  he knew his best place was to help luke from the great beyond of the force 
1,i heard this picture
1,just mix and match and create your own universe   for example i love seeing the original thrawn trilogy as my sequels
1,they don t tell a story that enriches the themes of the other six movies in anyway 
1,this is what i said all along  before tros  while everyone was speculating that disney seems to be on the track of going  grey  with the force in the sequel trilogy  i kept trying to remind people that that would completely undermine what gl has said about balance and the force  that balance and harmony is achieved when the dark side isn t present 
1,no  he s not  he s a kid that represents hope for the resistance  that s pretty much it  he s not even really a character 
1,he was supposed to off himself with mace windu s blade i m 80  sure
1,never considered that the jedi order could live on through grogu  question is  does he survive school shooting 2 electric boogaloo  and did snoke palpatine kylo ren know about grogu so they would know to kill him when they were killing jedi
1,  thisi think there s zero chance jj did the math here  or cares about fleshing out any of the details for evidence i refer you to  literally all of jj s work  i know non fans tease sci fi and genre fans about all of our weird knowledge  and i think that s fine  in the grand scheme of things  the year rey s dad was born does not matter   they re movies in a fictional universe  but there s no reason to approach it this way other than laziness  the same thing happens in star trek  and the writers   creators act like what came before is really dragging them down and holding them back  i d argue that constraints are actually fuel for creativity  tho  and that for the most part fans griping about canon and continuity is just because they want things to make sense  that these properties are so often handled by people who don t care about the details is both depressing and doesn t make a lot of sense disney and star wars didn t  need  jj abrams  they could ve easily made beautiful movies without him  likely some which were coherent and internally consistent 
1,from what i ve read i do think dotf would have been a more interesting take on ep ix  the time jump explaining rey s training with luke  hux s character getting some focus as being secretly bitter about  not  being force sensitive is interesting  finn actually acting like a war weary ex stormtrooper and not slapstick comic relief that seems utterly disconnected from the fo honestly i think the biggest issues for the st is that it never felt like they actually had a lab overall story to tell  the entire set up is more or less 2 0 version of empire vs rebels  and they seemed so bloody focused on killing off or sidelining the ot characters to prop up new characters that they seemingly had no actual faith in i ve seen reports saying how disney and rian said they found writing luke  very difficult because his presence overshadows everything        i m sorry but if as a writer you find that you can t write your original characters well enough to not completely be overshadowed by the ot ppl then that s your problem did they really not think that watching rey or finn connect and build relationships with luke over multiple movie would somehow make us like them less  or that leia and poe couldn t have got more focus as general and possible protege     or han and ben now i know there were the real world reasons like harrison ford really not wanting to come back and carrie fisher sadly passing away but even in early stages it just seemed like the st wanted to sideline kill off downplay the the trio from the ot so much  which unfortunately robbed us of the chance to embrace new  well written  characters who are embraced and developed alongside the ot trio 
1,oh yes  then why every episodes last shot frames important characters   he was clearly planned to be used in ix 
1,starkiller base started construction under the empire  when the empire fell  the remnant on ilum probably just kept on building  probably becoming one of the few safe places for imperial remnants to gather and regroup 
1,i read the script for dual of the fates  and i completely agree  it was obviously a first draft  and a few changes would have been necessary with carrie fisher s death  but it made the trilogy really coherent  it s a damn shame it didn t get made on a related note  i wish disney would just go ahead and make it  then tell the fans they can have whichever ep  ix they want  kinda like dc is doing with snyder cut of justice league  let s be honest  disney would easily make another billion dollars from it  even if it was just so so in the end  and the fans would all go see it  regardless of which ep  ix they ended up preferring  the biggest challenge would be getting the talent back 
1,i don t buy this money grabbing argument at all  star wars fans can be stupid easy to please  the writing does not need to be earned or well done  it just has to show things in the way fans expect i mean look how much people freaked out from the simple act of luke just showing up in the mandalorian  it s not like that required any particular writing talent  it s literally just luke shows up and wrecks everyone  he s more of an action figure than a character in that scene if the sequels were interested in money  this is all they needed to do  they wouldn t need to do anything risky at all 
1,always have  always will 
1,agreed 
1,the characters werent really developed   luke wasnt treated well   and a lack of cohesion and originalitythose are the main criticisms i hear about the sequels
1,why not both  i ve always seen the movies as telling the main  big picture of the series and the shows flesh out all the smaller things that happened in between 
1,  gonk   
1,  gonk   
1,not op but to me  tlj didn t came out and undid anything in tfa  snoke was just a big generic evil dude in tfa  and he died like that in tlj  kylo was struggling with light and dark  and he ended the movie a complete mess even luke s portrail    like  he did the same shit yoda and obi wan did when they realized the jedi order had failed  my problem with epi ix was that it went out of its way to say that tlj was wrong or it never happened  and it takes you out of the story  it feels like the producers and directors saying  see  that thing you don t like never actually happened 
1,cool  still don t like the movie 
1,i think zahn s thrawn trilogy  literally  gets recommended first  and more 
1,i mean the reason he was in exile was to let the jedi order die since training force users as jedi has seemingly always led to the rise of the dark side and the galaxy is thrown into chaos over and over again because of it the point is he realized his mistake in the end and thanks to his sacrifice the jedi order will rise againplus untrained force users don t seem like they have the power to be much of a problem to the galaxy as a whole so i don t get your reasoning here
1, gt  and for the most part  they don t actually undo anything from the movies that came before them that s really debatable  so tlj didn t dead end a lot of the plotlines that had been set up in tfa  tfa didn t essentially nullify the end of rotj   with the rebellion defeating the republic   and return us to the same old status quo without a reasonable explanation 
1,i hope they somehow make the sequels some alt universe  because this is messed up so luke turns against his only blood  because he senses a darkness in him   but trains rey   who is a palpatine    what is the point of the skywalker saga if this is how it ends im convinced disney intentionally ruined the saga out of spite because tbh   star wars is mythos that could easily outlast anything disney has done 
1,i agree with this assessment  i by no means want the movies to end but instead of the star wars movie every year thing i d rather have them space the movies out more and focus more on shows
1,if you re not with me  then you are my enemy 
1,a better ending than dying off by a blaster
1,so  solo  and tros  then abrams didn t really work with the story group much  which isn t their fault  it s the story group that keeps canon 
1,i never got into kyle katarn because he sounded a little over the top which probably stems from being a video game character but it d be nice for his fans if he came back  just change the background slightly so hes a resistance agent and he can be around  amp  alive in the sequel era where there s more freedom to do stuff
1,totally agree  the two of them had the best dynamic in tfa  we never got the same back and forth in the subsequent 2 movies which is baffling  finn s character was so badly squandered by the writing team that it makes me sad to see tfa again and all the potential that was set up in the first sequel 
1,the acolyte will cover this  i m sure 
1,the x wing series  any chapter really  all it would need is some new graphics and some fresh missions 
1,the last 2 movies  and im typing from my phone today  auto correct   
1,  gonk      lt  lt whrrrr gt  gt     gonk           lt  lt all your batteries are recharged now gt  gt  
1,  gonk 
1,here is the difference  tfa and tlj were made by the directors writers to be the films they wanted to make  and for the most part  they don t actually undo anything from the movies that came before them  it s not like we are getting a reveal that luke isn t actually the kid of darth vader or anything  it may have not gone the way people wanted or predicted but it didn t really undo anythingtros feels like a direct response to people yelling on the internet tros plays like if they went to reddit and just took some fan theories and threw them together thinking that would somehow make a good movie 
1, bro  those force powers are hella lit  
1,i really dislike how they had finn switch sexual tensions with every episode  by the last movie it s like they didn t know what to do with his character anymore  he had a lot of potential as an ex stormtrooper and the third movie made no effort to complete his story arc  it s a damn shame 
1,if not live action  an animated show based on just that will most likely be one more wonderful thing the mandalorian has spawn  maybe once the bad batch wraps up and w e the main story between all these interconnected shows wraps up  the next round of star wars may start here  i hope we do go far away from this time period  both directions bc i d like to see the old republic   but they could modify all the old republic stuff and make it 800 years in the future making grogu witness to someone like revan   
1, gt star wars seems to have a much higher success rate when it comes to executing tv shows vs movies  why is this i think that s just a perception  when you boil something down to a simple good bad rating  you have to average things out and with a tv show  you have more content to use to create that average  fans praise the clone wars and rebels  and rightly so  because they have some excellent stuff in there  but both those shows contain some flat out awful episodes as well   i don t think  it s that tv is more successful  it s just that you get more opportunities for redemption   gt one problem is that a trilogy is only 6 hours of content that you can create and a tv show allows for years and years of new episodes and really fleshed out world building  the movies have to pick and choose the things that they focus on and it leads to a lot of gaps in the story and at times a rushed pace that s one of the huge benefits of long form storytelling has over short form  you get to really dig deep rather than trying to cram as much as you can into a short runtime  you have to make choices on what s important to you in that kind of story telling and sometimes people like your choices and sometimes they don t  so should star wars stick to tv  if by  stick to tv  you mean  continue making tv shows  then the answer is a resounding yes  they re doing a great job so far and we ve got a lot of cool stuff coming down the pipeline that we probably would never get if they were only doing films  if you re suggesting that they cut films out entirely and only do television  i think that would be a poor choice  when you choose to make a story  you re rolling the dice  theres equal potential for it to be good or bad  we re probably going to get a bad star wars tv show at some point and we re probably going to get another great star wars film eventually  in my opinion  more star wars is never a bad thing  it just means that there s more to find and enjoy 
1,yeah tros ruined the trilogy for me
1,what makes them dummies  and do you even know who you re talking about it s  canon   anyway  not  cannon  
1,100  agree  they should have had a story set up fully before they even hired a director  if they wanted them to write the scripts  they needed to say you need to hit these story lines  no budging
1,they look great 
1,well    how old would ashoka be
