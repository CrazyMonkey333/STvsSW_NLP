First of all he is a fucking dark jedi. Him being wounded would fuel him with pain which he would then turn into anger. Making him even stronger. And even if he was wounded. Why was he still able to move around so easily? 

&gt;Rey has just awakened to a heavy power in the force, which isn't a reason enough to win. What is, is that while yes, she's never used a Lightsabre before, she has been shown throughout the movie to be heavily proficient in the use of her staff. A staff isn't a one to one match up for a Lightsabre, but it is beleiveable that she would be able to fight well in a melee fight.

A staff is something entirely different than a lightsaber. Also she isin't a master when it comes to fighting with a staff. Far from it. A lightsaber requires years of training to master and it would take months to even properly hold it in your hands. Without you cutting yourselfs. Also rey has shown to randomly use a jedi fucking mindtrick while she just heard of them. 



&gt;It was impossible to have a satisfying and well written payoff to Rey's parents? No cuz The Last Jedi did it, which TROS then ruined. Impossible for Snoke? No. None of it was impossible. Difficult? Some of it. But none of it was impossible.

He is fully trained Dark jedi. Teached by both snoke and Luke Skywalker. It was IMPOSSIBLE for him too loose the fight against a girl who's only skill is too use a staff. Still wouldnt make any sense that she is suddenly good with a lightsaber because she used a staff once or twice in her life. A sword and staff are two entirely different things. You aren't suddenly able to weild a sword if you trained with a staff all of your life. 

&gt;Same motivation? A storm trooper who finds his own identity and uses it to run from his problems but grows to learn that his issues won't dissappear without his intervention. Rey wants to find her parents and stay exactly on the planet she was on, yet Luke wanted to do the opposite, he wants to find the adventure while Rey rejects it. 


Just because they changed a few things doesnt suddenly mean the story is good. Finn went from caring about his fellow stormtrooper who died in his arms. To murdering them all 10 minutes later. Rey wants to go back to a planet which is probably overrun with stormtroopers when she returns. She can't go back there. The first order probably left behind tons of spy's and stormtroopers in case she comes back. 

The new character are mostly original i agree. But the story went absolutely no where in this movie. Leia blindlly trusting Finn for no reason even though he could be a bloody spy for all we know. Han being too lazy to bring finn and rey directly to the resistance base. Starkiller base somehow being build in a span of 30 years.

Fans can pull whatever video and image source they want to get the best result without fear of consequences, at least for the time being.

A large company with deep pockets can't escape notice so easily.

This reminds me of when Crispin Glover sued the producers of Back To The Future 2 for recycling footage from the first film without paying him. He set a precedent if I remember correctly and apparently, according to the Wikipedia article, SAG now bars the use of an actor's likeness in some cases, though the way the article section is written it doesn't make it clear which methods are barred (having another actor impersonate the original actor or using footage from another film).

I also don't like that it is a point of no return for Star Wars in general with the PG-13 rating.

First there has been a significant fan base of the prequels for years (even prior to the sequels). People forget that the people who grew up with the prequels like myself are now adults with jobs and all that and it wasn’t until recent years that we got a voice online. In terms of your actual question, Revenge of the Sith is my all time favorite movie for so many reasons. It’s a tragic story and that ma something we don’t see alot in movies like this, especially compared to the sequels and OT where the trilogies end with a “happy ending.” You say the dialogue is trash and the story isn’t any good but there’s so much genius behind the story. It’s the culmination of a 1000 year plot by the Sith to take over the galaxy and the downfall of this selfless young man into something terrifying. The movie shows the flaws of this Jedi Order that was referenced back in the 70s and 80s trilogy and how it was arrogance and denial (concepts Jedi stand against) that ultimately led to their own destruction. The genius behind the Sith evolving into politicans instead of these typical warriors seem thousands of years prior just showed how the Sith were ready to adapt. The Jedi were fighting an enemy that was in a form they couldn’t recognize. The heartbreak behind an army of clones with their own feelings and thoughts being programmed to enact an entire genocide of monks is one of the movies strong points. What I really love about the movie is the amount of different locations we get to see in the galaxy. In the orginals and in the sequels we see a total of like 5 planets in each trilogy. In Episode 3 alone we see so many unique and mew planets with different life forms and terrain. So much thought went into the design of the many settings seen in the story. Ewan Mcgregor has Obiwan is the best preformance of the movie. You see this Jedi Master who we see as the perfect Jedi fall apart after learning the boy he essentialy raised for over a decade has become this servant of evil and the emotion he showed after realising that he’s can’t save Anakin is beautifully written. I get some of the lines in the movie are a bit ehh but the story and the thought given to the characters the the wider galaxy is honestly enough to make up for some of the off moments. I hope this clarifies a but why people love this movie and why a significant amount of people actually say this is the best Star Wars movie.

It did absolutely suffer from not having a firm outline/vision for the trilogy though.

I do agree about Duel of the Fates. I read the leak and I was actively mad they didn't try to stick with that more. I do think it would have been much more cohesive with the 7 and 8 that we got but still would've felt disconnected. 

I really truly believe that if episodes 7, 8 and 9 were instead episodes 10, 11 and 12 (12 would still need a lot of work) then they would've been received much better. I said this after 8 was released but it should be so evident post Mandalorian.

Now, I love TLJ Luke, I completely buy he's where he's at but it's still just not what I wanted to see. I'm so friggin tired of the reluctant hero story. It's one of the chief ongoing problems with Batman movies is that most of the time he can't wait to stop being Batman.

What I do believe is at least episodes 7 and 8 will age so much better now that Fav-Roni are exploring the time.

[],,macbalance,,,[],,,,text,t2_b9pld,False,False,[],"Disclaimer: I *like* TLJ. I hoped TRoS would have improved it. Also, from some new expanded universe stuff I've seen, the First Order was  a lot more interesting during the Cold War period when they could be used as actually slightly subtle space nazis instead of over the top. Think the nazis from the early Indiana Jones films that have limited authority and are concerned about being the face of law and order. 

I feel like TRoS would have been much better if it had baked for another year or two. It's got a lot of good stuff:

* Well acted.
* Some great set-pieces like the fight on the DS wreckage our the Rey/Kylo hand-off sequence.

The bits that bothered me:

* The plot feels forced and just kind of boring. Sure, TFA was kind of a knock-off of ANH, but there was at least fun characters in it!
* The plot was rushed. No foreshadowing to the whole ""Emperor's not dead"" plot element, for example.
* It relied on a lot of stuff that either didn't matter (Most of the C3P0 plot felt kind of like a waste when it was done; the dagger worked despite Rey being in a practically random location.)
* The last combat felt like a bad knock-off of the Infinity War ending, with everyone showing up. The big difference is in IW everyone got to *do something meaningful* in the last fight. Here  the main relevant was just being there. A big comparison to RotJ is at least the fleet in that movie is important. It's suggested that even if Luke had removed the Emperor that the DS2 would still be a huge threat. Here there's a bunch of Star Destroyers which are certainly potential threats, but in a much less immediate or interesting way.
* This is related to many of the above, but missing from TRoS is any real sort of ""Then gang are back together and it's awesome"" moments. At least in RotJ we feel like we have an actual team of characters going in to the final conflict, whereas the groups are separate in TRoS.

I feel like Carrie Fisher's death made a lot of plots difficult, but in general I wanted something better. My 'dream version' is that it's a few years after TLJ and the big conflict is that the First Order has a crack formed because Hux and Kylo Ren aren't capable of ruling individually, so have a toxic relationship of Ren as the 'spiritual' leader (with his Knights and such as inquisitor-types ruling from the DS2 ruins) and Hux as the military-industrial-complex ruler (who knows where the bodies are buried and can get stuff done, but is not really capable of compelling endless loyalty). Not sure how it'd progress, but the Resistance would have to exploit this.

(Also, Ren and Hux would each have their own 'advisors' of sorts. Kylo would have ghost-emperor and ghost-like as something akin to the 'shoulder-angel/shoulder-devil' trope, while Hux would probably have less interesting Military and Corporate advisors. )",,,1609711787,{},gi01fqu,False,t3_kpnza4,False,True,t3_kpnza4,/r/StarWars/comments/kpnza4/the_real_problem_with_the_sequels_that_no_one/gi01fqu/,1609718032,1,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,,0,[],

The first point I agree with, this one I do not. Reasons Rey one that fight fairly

1. Kylo is shown multiple times to have been wounded heavily on his leg (kind of essential for a lightsabre fight) not only that, he was injured by a wookie blaster bolt, which have been shown to kill people with a single shot in the film.

2. Rey has just awakened to a heavy power in the force, which isn't a reason enough to win. What is, is that while yes, she's never used a Lightsabre before, she has been shown throughout the movie to be heavily proficient in the use of her staff. A staff isn't a one to one match up for a Lightsabre, but it is beleiveable that she would be able to fight well in a melee fight.

Kylo has a heavy disadvantage, underestimating Rey and having a serious injury aswell as Rey being proficient with a Melee weapon and basic force skills is why it's makes sense she won the fight 

&gt;It was impossible to make a sequel to this because of the fact that it was so similair to a new hope. Thats why the last jedi was also very similair to the empire strikes back. Because Rian was backed into a corner. 

It was impossible to have a satisfying and well written payoff to Rey's parents? No cuz The Last Jedi did it, which TROS then ruined. Impossible for Snoke? No. None of it was impossible. Difficult? Some of it. But none of it was impossible.


&gt;No it wasn't. Most of the motivations where the exact same as in a New Hope. The rebels are looking for a droid because it contains important information, They have to blow a giant planet killing weapon etc etc. The movie was god awfull in my opinion. But i am glad you found something to like in it.

Same motivation? A storm trooper who finds his own identity and uses it to run from his problems but grows to learn that his issues won't dissappear without his intervention. Rey wants to find her parents and stay exactly on the planet she was on, yet Luke wanted to do the opposite, he wants to find the adventure while Rey rejects it. 

Let's go over and compare a scene that some say is a copy. 

Cantina: In TNH it acts as a launching point for the adventure, Luke and Obi Wan meet Jan and Chewie, teach some scum in the cantina a lesson and make an escape on a high point. 

TFA, it acts as the mid point the characters lowest point, they go there for info, and while Fin tries to run The First Order attacks and takes the one good thing he had found since he left The First Order, Rey. It ends on a very low note and launches Fins Character Change. 

As for characters. 
Luke = Rey. Not at all, there motivations are very much the opposite, and there personalitys differ aswell. A brash cocky kid craving Adventure who thinks he knows best. A girl abandoned who holds onto false hope that someone will come for her, who is skilled in survival after having to fight alone for so long. 

Fin=?. Not Han, not Luke, I really don't know. 

Han=?. Acts as a mentor sure, but acts as not only the Obi Wan role, but also the Han. Strange. 

Kylo=Vader. No, Kylo is a child who isn't sure of himself, trying to live up to a false idea of Vader, he's nowhere near the calm cold powerhouse Vader was, despite trying to be.

* **The next movie can't have a time jump:** It absolutely can. Have the film open with Rey handing Luke the saber, Luke reacts, cut forward 5 years to deal with the aftermath of that first encounter, good or bad. No corner. Odd to have a time jump right at the beginning? Sure, but better than not having one at all. 
* **Separates the main characters:** I see this less as a problem and more of an avenue to take. How do the main characters get back to eachother over the course of this movie? Add in the potential time jump and it's even easier. No corner.
* **Kylo Ren is injured:** Which pushes him further down the dark side and makes him feel closer to his grandfather. OR it could be a ""slap in the face"" that makes him start questioning which side he's on. No corner here. 
*  **Snoke, aka Evil Old Ugly Baddie 2.0 Exists:** Snoke could have been so many things. A puppet for Palpatine, a usurper who doesn't understand that he's fucking with Skywalkers, an ancient Sith exile back from the outer rim, etc. You could do so much with that.
*  **Rey needs to know what happened to her parents:** Again, there are multiple options. Her parents being nobody I thought was actually awesome. Should've stuck with that. Also, Luke didn't find out who his pappy really was until Episode 5. 
*  **Luke Abandoned everyone to the point where Han Solo died:** This is surprising character development, and something interesting to explore in the followup films. So much to unwrap and explore there. You could have a redemption arc, you could make him the sacrifice guy like Ben, you could make him go evil. Luke experiencing failure does not ruin his character. It allows him to grow and transform and learn.
*  **The hero beats the villain in the first movie, which goes against typical story structure:** Except Episode 4 ends with Luke and the Rebellion blowing up the death star and getting medals. And Episode 1 ends with Naboo saved and Darth Maul destroyed, destroying Palpatines plans up to that point. Also they got medals. Perhaps people should've gotten more medals at the end of TFA?
* **Empire vs. Rebels 2.0:** Yeah I didn't like this either. It was unoriginal and they could've done something cooler. I think they just didn't know how to have the big space battles and space military that people like without repeating their predecessors. They took the easy route.

TROS is not necessarily a bad movie, it has great cinematography, good acting, some good concepts and ideas but the issue with it is the leading hands of the project either didn't know what to do or were scampering to fix the backlash to TLJ.

I've said the same about the sequels as I have about the other two trilogies - the middle act depends entirely on the third act for whether or not it works. TFA is fondly remembered even though it's very much a greatest-hits case, but it's a good film that stands on it's own, honours the past and offers up the future. TPM fell in this regard because it was entirely standalone, as a prequel it had to work towards the established canon and build an entire world before that which still felt like the world we knew. It had no prior building blocks, except for things that were chronologically yet to happen, and it had to build up to the climax of the Clone Wars. It had a very vast head start, perhaps more than necessary, and between some bad decisions that felt off in-universe and a lot of ground to cover where not much really happens, it fell flat.

The difference between the older trilogies and the new one was that the second acts fit in as pieces of the puzzle, even though Empire was praised and AOTC was not they both served the purpose of continuing the previous story and did them in fairly safe but pleasing ways, Clones just did this to a lesser degree and left quite a sour taste because of the depiction of Anakin. But then, those trilogies got a cohesive final act that pulled it all together. Empire and AOTC were both improved by ROTJ and ROTS, because they paid off a narrative clearly in the making, they tied things up and delivered powerful emotional payoffs for long-built relationships and plot threads. TLJ should have been the same. It's legacy depended entirely on episode 9, but from what we know I don't believe either film would have satisfied the same way the other trilogies did.

TROS for example dropped the ball on all character relationships except for Rey and Ben (and partially Rey and Leia) and managed to reduce the rest of the cast to caricatures with dead-end development. Instead of properly resolving the existing plot threads, we got Palpatine back, and not in a way that benefited the story as it could have if he had been a lingering warning of the dark side and a corrupting force, instead he was literally the villain and drove the plot. TROS did not work in service of either of the prior films or offer satisfying conclusions to anything except Ben Solo's arc, and that retroactively left TLJ to still be considered a failure where it could have been elevated to the most important piece of the puzzle.

Neither DOTF or TROS seemed to serve the trilogy properly, at least in my view. They both has great ideas and bad ideas, you could take bits and pieces from both projects and make a satisfying movie, but instead we wound up with a just-okay conclusion when we were promised a satisfying ending to the entire saga.",,,1609711192,{},gi0055t,False,t3_kpnza4,False,False,t3_kpnza4,/r/StarWars/comments/kpnza4/the_real_problem_with_the_sequels_that_no_one/gi0055t/,1609717293,4,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,,0,[],

- Rey has no character arc, and really no character. She's good at everything and everyone loves her. She can already beat Luke and Kylo in hand-to-hand combat without needing to 'balance' anything. If she is supposed to be a 'gray jedi', jamming an arc into Episode 9 wouldn't be enough to make anyone interested in her, that late in the game. 

- TLJ seems to forget about Finn's origins, almost completely except for the fight with Phasma. He has no issue killing stormtroopers and often provides comic relief while doing so. To have him then lead a bunch of rebel stormtroopers would be jarring; five minutes ago he was making jokes while he murdered their comrades.

- Why would Luke want to haunt Kylo after having decided on a whim that Kylo should be killed in cold blood? We know force ghosts can move things in the real world (Yoda and the temple), so why not just turn on Kylos lightsaber while it's on his belt? TLJ botched Luke so bad that even if they went ahead with Duel of the Fates, his character arc is a mess and I for one would not be interested in seeing it. I'm glad JJ largely left him dead. 

- the location of the final battle and cartoon/ videogame tie-ins aren't story beats. They are merchandising and franchising opportunities.

Lawrence Kasadan: The Force was available to anyone who could hook into it?

George Lucas: Yes, everyone can do it.

Kasadan: Not just the Jedi?

Lucas: It's just the Jedi who take the time to do it.

Marquand: They use it as a technique.

Lucas: Like yoga. If you want to take the time to do it, you can do it; but the ones that really want to do it are the ones who are into that kind of thing.

It would be TLJ 2.0 times 100, if only for the first bullet point alone.

First Jedi to truly embrace being 'human' (lacking a better term, how does it apply with non humans?) is silly, because Yoda already accomplished this when he faced his inner darkness during the Clone Wars. He prevailed by coming to the realization that his darkness exists, and by acknowledging and accepting that reality, allowed him to deny it power over him. That does not mean he now has the means to use the dark side for power!

The notion of Rey struggling with the dark side was a great story, but this take on it would have been terrible, and therein lies one of my personal beefs with the sequel films. They had a great setup for two characters showcasing the struggle with the dark side from either side of the equation, and denied us a great chance to see Rey nearly give in to the dark side, not because Palpatine had her in a no win situation, but because she craved the power the dark side offered, without realizing she was about to rush head first into ruin, and only with the help of someone, Kylo Ren/Ben Solo, who has lived on the dark side but ultimately found it lacking could she turn away from the brink of disaster.

Oh, so much lost potential. I'm imagining a rage fueled Dark side Rey fighting a centered and balanced Ben Solo. The things they could have done with that! Could have Anakin's blade bleed into a red saber during the fight (because Ben would totally be using Leia's saber), a sign that Ben would pick up on that violence would not resolve anything, but the Jedi way could. Flash to the Luke/Leia practice flashback. Resolving the conflict doesn't come from the skill of the blade, but through compassion. Have him drop Leia's saber, taking a maiming blow, but embraces her, and tells her it's ok, she can let it all go now, she doesn't have to fight anymore.

Great: Cap going back in time. It's *absolutely fan service*.

Him being sorely tempted when they get the stones is absolutely consistent with his character and the story and it's a functional, natural part of the story for him - knowing the 'great evil' has been stopped and time travel is basically risk free - to take that option and go for that dance. It's fan service but doesn't *feel* like a forced ""Hey, Listen!""

Awful: Girls Assemble. It's the middle of a warzone where they've *all been actively fighting* for a solid 15 minutes but are somehow all close enough and completely not engaged in combat to meet up with flawless timing. Mantis is present despite being a completely non-combative superhero, Gamora doesn't know *any of these people* at this point, Rescue removes her helmet purely for the face-time, Shuri apparently abandons her people and army to chip in.

TROS brought back Palpatine and made the original trio’s accomplishments worth nothing. It also undermines Anakin’s role in the entire story. The worst part about TROS is that the state of the universe is the same as it was by the end of ROTJ. 

DOTF has some very neat ideas such as having the climax at both Coruscant and Mortis plus having Finn actually have a role in the story. What’s kills the script for me personally is the ending to Kylo’s story (it’s more depressing than TROS), a Rey and Poe romance (incredibly random), and the inclusion of Tor Valum.

Kylo’s story is actually pretty cool in DOTF because he’s on a quest for power but the problem is that he stays evil for the entirety of DOTF and dies evil. That’s a depressing ending for the Skywalker bloodline. 

Rey and Poe being a couple sounds like really bad and random writing. These two had no interactions at all in the first two movies and now are randomly a couple. 

The inclusion of a character like Tor Valum breaks the SW lore as it destroys the rule of two. His role is also strange because he’s established as Palpatine’s or I think Plagueis’s master and has like 5 minutes of screentime where he teaches Kylo to essentially be a force vampire and then Kylo just kills him. 

I think it would have been better to have Tor Valum be the main antagonist and have him be one of the Whills from one of George’s original ideas for the trilogy where the Whills were going to be revealed as parasitic beings, feeding off of the force.

The Shipyard at the beginning is specifically Kuat 

The Ship they steal wasn't just any Star Destroyer, it was *The Eclipse* SSD completely with it's super laser and it becomes the new Resistance flagship 

After lighting the temple beacon Finn and Rose are forced to flee into the lower levels of Coruscant where they're saved by locals who have been fighting back. They also find groups of storm troopers have been defecting after hearing about how Finn just left and was still accepted by those outside the order

The final battle involves the Resistance's limited fleet and *The Eclipse* trying to break through the FO fleet, which includes a few new dreadnaught type ships (Courscant is the FO capital in this btw). They're nearly overwhelmed since *The Eclipse* can't use it's super laser without fear of missing and killing millions on the planet's surface
 
On the ground Finn gives a speech that rallies even more stormtroopers to their cause and he leads the locals and the Stormtroopers, with a collection of modified FO and Imperial vehicles, in an attack on the upper levels that secures a landing zone for the liberating Resistance ground forces

The main goal of attack Coruscant was to destroy the First Order citadel, a docked super ship that had served as their base over the decades and was also the source of the jamming tech they'd been using to limit galactic communications, thus keeping the remaining Republic forces and Resistance from effectively coordinating and fighting back. the citadel ship can be seen in the background in the concept art of Hux killing himself. Mr Sunday says it was Windu's lightsaber, but iirc it was actually implied to be one of Palpatine's blades from episode III. That would've been right after *The Eclipse* landed the killing shot on The Citadel and Hux realized the battle was lost and he could either die on his terms or be captured and tried in court

The ground team is attempting to upload a code that will cause the Citadel to broadcast a specific signal *The Eclipse* can lock onto so it can take it out without worrying about missing and leveling a swath of city

R2 is the one who is carrying this program but takes a shot in battle, handing it off to BB-8 to finish the mission (R2 lives, dont worry)

As the Resistance fleet is being pushed back they do have a ""Help arrives"" moment like in TROS, but instead of a fleet of random bullshit, it's a New Republic fleet answering the call to arms broadcast from the temple earlier on. I think they might also be under the command of a legacy character, but I'm not sure

[],,DudeofallDudes,,,[],,,,text,t2_e3abv,False,False,[],"I’d like to preface this by saying I’ve never bothered to watch the Rise of Skywalker but here’s a quick synopsis of my issues with the trilogy but I’ve already said them a million times. 1st mistake rehashing episode 4’s plot in episode 7, same rebels vs empire completely diminishes the events of the OT and leaves us feeling like we’ve already watched a better version of the film. Should have explored the sequel trilogy as more of an adventure series exploring the history of Jedi and Sith with some geopolitical situation like the new republic trying to maintain peaceful order across the galaxy while respecting self-determination of different cultures and planets because that’s something we’ve never seen. Two I dislike shoe horned lines about sjw perspectives of life in a galaxy far far away, for example when Finn grabs Rey’s hand and she yells at him several times. That was just embarrassing for everyone and pointless, at no point did Luke grab Leia’s hand on the Death Star or anakin grab padme’s hand on the battle of Geonosis, it’s stupid and adds nothing to the story and solves a problem that doesn’t exist in this universe. Thirdly what they did to Luke is insulting, he was not the Luke we saw in the OT and he distinctly existed to insult white males and belittle them imo. You’ve already heard a million reasons why it doesn’t make in universe sense for Luke to be the way he was and there’s a million alternatives so I’ll leave it at that. Fourth is obviously the Mary Sue argument, that nothing Rey did was earned or relatable, she was just a superhero with no backstory and no character, anakin came from slavery and feared padme’s death due to the trauma of his mother, he had quirks and pitifall’s that led him to the dark side. Luke similarly joined the rebellion after he lost everything with the death of his aunt and uncle, after his discovery of his father he battled within himself whether to succumb to the same temptations of his father, repeatedly struggling and failing in his training. None of this happens to Rey, she’s just the best always and forever and don’t tell me Kylo got shot by Chewie’s blaster or none of that nonsense, there’s many ways that could have been handled better. Fifth Finn and Poe are relegated to nothingness and I find their storylines, especially Poe’s extremely insulting to all males. Poe being repeatedly belittled while receiving no input from his out of universe purple dyed superior seems to parallel with how I think Kathleen Kennedy runs the company and it’s pathetic and insulting. Sixth the whole sequence with yoda and Luke burning the books or whatever feels like a cheap way of trying to explain away their destruction of the EU while trying to pretend like they weren’t just trying to avoid paying royalties, it also doesn’t fit the motivations of either character and I think it sets a horrible message to everyone, knowledge is always positive and worth looking into even if you’ve found a better way of life it’s important to understand our history and where we come from even in a fictional universe you think two of the most honourable and bright characters would understand the importance of historical works but I don’t the Disney’s story group has ever flipped through a history textbook. Seventh Leia flying through space breaks several rules we understand about the force and is all the more ridiculous when the previous film literally had Han make fun of outlandish uses of the force. Eighth Han and Chewie going back to being smugglers is firstly ridiculous, a 70 year old living that life smh, secondly destroys the character development from the OT, thirdly it just feels like a squandered opportunity to double down on the message of hope that is pervasive in the OT, Han and Leia should have stayed together in spite of the conflict with their son cause that’s the type of love and hope we finally established with Vader saving Luke in the OT and the type of precedence we discover in all their characters not just Luke. I’ve got a bunch of other minor issues but I’ll leave it at that for now and conclude by saying to me it felt like TLJ especially was written by someone who really hated Star Wars and everything it stood for. It was a complete slap in the face to sit through those films and all the more disheartening knowing it was the only chance to see our OT heroes on screen one last time. It hurts me on a deep level because of my upbringing with Star Wars and how the messages in those films shaped who I am today. The messages in the sequels terrify me thinking children might hold some of those concepts close to their heart because many of them are horrible ideals. The one positive thing I see people spout from the sequels is that lineage doesn’t matter, but to me our hereditary relationships are a huge part of who we are but that doesn’t mean they control your destiny, Luke overcame the hereditary relationship with his father so why does that need to be disrespected to push this anyone can be great narrative, we already new anyone could be great cause Luke came from nothing, Han was a smuggler, Leia was a princess but they all built who they were through their own efforts. The sequels is just Rey doing everything and Poe and Finn are there to dismantle the patriarchy by belittling men on screen? That’s the message I get from the films and I’m at a loss to what their existence on screen means besides that. I’m really disgusted and disappointed by the sequels and I refuse to acknowledge them as part of the Star Wars universe and I hope whoever was in charge of them is let go and moved on from.

He was the Ben Kenobi of this trilogy, the wisened old veteran who helps the hero and sacrifices himself to save the others. 

Only difference is he had to have a change of heart to make him do it where as Ben was still following the Jedi way even after his former Padawan had betrayed him.

I think alot of people missed, or just didn't care, about the way that Luke and Obi Wan ended up having a very similar story, it's just that all of the cool stuff Luke did for the Jedi before being betrayed happened off screen.

No.  I don't know why you seem to be intentionally misreading me.  I'm saying they could care less about whether the themes of the new movies line up with subtle points about the previous canon, as long as these themes have broad appeal.  Clearly, the part about mass appeal means they care ""about a multibillion-dollar franchise film"" (duh), but my point is they only care in so far as it can make them money. 

&gt;If Disney didn't give a shit, why'd they completely throw it all out with TRoS? 

I don't understand what you're trying to say here.  The fact that they didn't continue to emphasize this theme just reinforces my point.  They don't care about thematic continuity or integrity.  They care about selling tickets and merch.  The reaction to Episode 8 scared them.  Even though they sold a bunch of tickets, the reaction was mixed, and Solo failed to impress at the box office afterwards, so they returned to what they thought was safe.

[],,Aevio11,,,[],,,,text,t2_5dgofayv,False,False,[],"This is my personal theory based on the lore I've absorbed over the years.

The Force has no ""dark"" or ""light"" side. The Force just is. It's a universal constant, like gravity. ""It binds us and penetrates us."" It's a basic building block of life. Attributing good or evil to a basic building block of life is like trying to say the Earth has the ""good kind"" of gravity, but black holes are pure evil. Good and evil is a measure of intent. This isn't the D&amp;D universe, forces of nature aren't inherently good or evil.

I believe that the Force works as an amplifier of sorts. It increase inherent abilities and allows living beings to do things beyond the scope of what their bodies would normally be able. Some force-users have different latent abilities, which is why some are more skilled in certain areas than others, and why select few have specific unique abilities that can't be replicated by others.

As an extension of this, the Force amplifies the emotions of the user. Anger is amplified into rage, love is amplified into obsession, anxiety is amplified into fear, confidence is amplified into pride. We see this time and time again with both Sith and Jedi who are lax in their restraint. Their flaws become exaggerated over time and they ""fall to the dark side,"" which is to say that they allow the Force to stoke the worst part of themselves.

This doesn't even fly in the face of the ideas laid out by the movies or the OT. If you notice, the Jedi don't ever encourage perceived ""positive"" emotions like love and joy; they encourage *detachment*. They teach their padawans from a very young age to cut themselves off from emotion altogether. Contrary to the Sith who stoke their emotions by delving deep into the Force, the Jedi are taught to avoid emotions altogether and only touch the surface of what the Force can truly do. Yes, Jedi believe in a Light and Dark side, but all that means is that the pragmatic knowledge of how the Force works has been couched in mysticism and the personification of human intent in a universal constant that has no ability to actually show conscious intent.

I'll believe it."" I didn't want Palpatine. He was dead. Then they had the audacity to suggest that Rey needed training, which TLJ very firmly said she was completely perfect in every way. Touch her hand with a leaf and now she knows the full extent and ability with the force. She can't even be tempted by the dark side. She gave herself completely to it in exchange for answers and it was apparently like ""Oh, well... I didn't have the answer prepared since I'm used to a little back and forth, but YOU just dived right in, didn't you?"" She was so nonplussed by the lack of hospitality and answers that all she needed was the comfort of Kylo Ren.

I'm not that excited for this script, but then I think it depends on where you thought the Sequels went wrong. As you can guess by my ranting, TLJ was the worst so TROS was okay to me. If you liked TLJ, then TROS did it dirty.

My attempt at a third movie would have been this:

* It's been 30 years since TLJ
* Rey has taken up Luke's hiding spot, because the best way to deal with the First Order with Kylo Ren in charge is to not do anything. He runs the First Order into the ground by killing anyone who disagrees with his obsessive search for Rey (which is all anyone does with her).
* There's still a splinter faction who made it away from Kylo Ren's control, however they are now opposed by Finn, Commander of the Free, who's finally grown up and leads ex-Stormtroopers to new lives as the new fleet of the Risen Republic (after it was shown to not exist after the first two movies).
* A new superweapon involves them allying with Temiri Blagg, the Blood-drinker of Canto Bight who was rumored to completely heal himself by drinking the blood of his foes. In truth, he used the force to heal his wounds by taking the blood of those nearby. The new Pirate planet of Canto Bight comes to their aid.
* Kylo Ren is confronted by the heroes, but he defeats them in turn. Rey appears, talks him down, and they go into exile. Tearful send-off for those who care, and Finn and Poe and Rose start playfully deciding where the new capital should be, which is led by Finn's question of ""What planet are we going to be okay getting blown up?"" and they all choose Canto Bight as the new capital of the Risen Republic.",,,1609708385,{},ghzu06x,False,t3_kpnza4,False,False,t3_kpnza4,/r/StarWars/comments/kpnza4/the_real_problem_with_the_sequels_that_no_one/ghzu06x/,1609713732,1,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,,0,[],

Luke. While at first I sounds intriguing to take Luke literal. Him haunting Kylo opens a huge can of worms.

Really?  Pretty sure Disney didn't really give a shit.  They probably figured that theme would have mass appeal so they gave it the thumbs up.

The stuff Lucas said about the prequels is interesting.  Hadn't heard that before.  Makes the whole idea of jedis going out into the galaxy to find young force users pretty weird.

The problem here is Lucas made Star Wars contradictory by including both Eastern and Western philosophy into one entity. He even calls himself a Buddhist Methodist, despite those being pretty contradictory ideologies.

We have dark, light, and a balance - indicating that they’re connected. This is very Taoist/Buddhist - that the dark and light are two poles of one vibrating energy. In that philosophy, you cannot destroy one or the other without destroying nature itself. The only truth is to make yourself totally empty and therefore to follow what in the Star Wars universe is the “will of the force.” But if you do that, if the force willed you to do something dark, does that make it wrong? Because if the divine will is present in all things, it is present then in even the most despicable acts. For example, Vader had to fall so far to the dark to realize there was no good ending there, which helped him turn back the other way.

But at the same time, we have labeled light and dark good and evil, indicating the dark is something different, corrupt, something that must be eradicated. This directly conflicts with the Buddhist philosophy and is the Christian segment of the whole thing. Reject the dark, embrace the light. So you are then rejecting half of the force, which doesn’t make any sense really. Because the more you try to prevent darkness, the more fearful you become and the more you end up creating it in the end (as prequel Jedi did).

Basically you cannot both say the universe is created by one good energy field consisting of two sides, and then also say simultaneously one side needs to be eliminated. Then you eliminate the universe as we know it. The philosophy, under any direct inspection, doesn’t really work. You could say they’re both in there so that people can pick and choose which parts they want to believe. But then if that’s the case, you can’t call someone wrong for picking the “eastern” aspects over the “western” ones.",,,1609707669,{},ghzsdye,False,t3_kpnza4,False,True,t1_ghzf6iz,/r/StarWars/comments/kpnza4/the_real_problem_with_the_sequels_that_no_one/ghzsdye/,1609712769,2,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,,0,[],

The whole fight was litterally Kylo being not able to use a lightsaber for some reason even though Luke fucking skywalker traineď him. And somehow Rey won the duel while the only thing she did was trying to stab him. 

&gt;and I feel it set up some great concepts and questions for the future, that unfortunatly were never payed off in a satisfying way. 

It was impossible to make a sequel to this because of the fact that it was so similair to a new hope. Thats why the last jedi was also very similair to the empire strikes back. Because Rian was backed into a corner.

[],,LittleYellowFish1,,,[],,,,text,t2_ws8nf,False,False,[],"With *The Force Awakens* Abrams was mainly just trying to replicate the original trilogy with a new Empire, a new Rebel Alliance and even a new Death Star, but Johnson and Treverrow were clearly trying to use his foundations to build a more unique story with its own meaningful message. After hearing the script/synopsis for *Duel of The Fates* I feel as though the trilogy was originally going to be mainly built around the idea that history is bound to be repeated by those who don’t learn from it, which I think could have complimented and built off the original saga very nicely.

Before the prequels came, the original trilogy ends on a strong note with the promise that Luke will rebuild the old Jedi order. But I had originally felt that the prequels weakened this by showing the Jedi order being run by arrogant procrastinating hypocrites, and the idea that Luke would rebuild this Jedi order didn’t sit well with me because I always felt there was a good chance he’d make the same mistakes (I wasn’t familiar with the EU).

But I think *The Last Jedi* and especially *Duel Of The Fates* would have remedied this really well. *TLJ* directly points out that the past Jedi order was inherently flawed and the Jedi were doomed by their own mistakes, but as Yoda points out, failure is just as important a teacher as success. Then in *Duel Of The Fates* Rey comes to understand what Luke meant by “the Force does not belong to the Jedi” and realises that to split Dark and Light into Jedi and Sith, good and evil, is an outdated and limited way to view the Force and how to use it.

So the goal in *Duel Of The Fates*, and the saga as a whole, would no longer be about *rebuilding* the Jedi order, but *replacing* it. Taking what worked about the past, understanding what didn’t, and making something new and better out of it.

Unfortunately, unlike Johnson and Treverrow, Abrams just dismisses the prequels and their importance to the story because he only wants to homage the original trilogy. So instead he cops out by bringing back Palpatine and making the conflict entirely dark vs light again, and the sequel trilogy ends the exact same way *Return Of The Jedi* did. Rey’s going to rebuild the Jedi order just like Luke was, and there’s nothing to indicate that she won’t just make the same mistakes that Luke and his predecessors did.

*Duel Of The Fates* probably wouldn’t have pleased the people who didn’t like the last two films (at this point I don’t think anything would have), but *The Rise Of Skywalker* didn’t even please the ones that did, and it actively robs the sequel trilogy of its narrative coherence and meaning.",,,1609707064,{},ghzr0vb,False,t3_kpnza4,False,True,t3_kpnza4,/r/StarWars/comments/kpnza4/the_real_problem_with_the_sequels_that_no_one/ghzr0vb/,1609711849,1,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,,0,[],

It was a sucker-punch, and it worked, but if any group were to make a habit out of it, they'd run out of ships in no time, without an actual warranty of accomplishing significant success. 

After all, a ship designed for war is supposed to be, tactically speaking, able to give you an advantage in resources: a ship that is good only to take down another ship produces no effective advantage. A single Star Destroyer was able to take on several opposing ships. That, in term, makes them valuable resources.

Anyway, that is my opinion and I could be wrong. I just shared to enrich the debate.",,,1609706844,{},ghzqizx,False,t3_kpshx4,False,True,t3_kpshx4,/r/StarWars/comments/kpshx4/the_holdo_maneuver_completely_ruins_the_last_jedi/ghzqizx/,1609711558,0,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,,0,[],

No it's not, that's barely even vague character motivations, let alone a character arc

&gt;I don’t really care what the plot is, so long as it achieves the goal of making the characters undergo interesting a difficult character struggles.

Well that's just dumb, you need interesting events to put your characters in to have growth and interesting moments. TLJ left us with nothing.

&gt;The problem with TROS as written is that it has lots of plot but little story.

Agreed, honestly. I'm not here to say RoS is a good movie, not sure that's possible lol. But I think a lot of it's problems come from TLJ giving it no plot to work with. The Rebels are no more, Kylo is still in the exact place he started, but with an army, I guess, and Rey is a bit better Jedi. Even the ideas explored between Rey and Kylo (which is the only part of the movie I actually think is good, for reference) are largely thrown out for the status quo post Crait. In fact, I think the movie would have been better cutting out Crait and leaving us with Rey and Kylo ruling together. Now you have a set up as the Rebels get away to start over, this time with Finn and Poe leading while out of their depth, and Rey and Kylo get a chance to explore the doomed to fail grey path as Rey fights to keep their new rule on the light side, especially when coming up to opposition from Finn and Poe and Kylo has to confront that his anger and such is the cause to his life going to shit.

Of course, you do have some trouble if you're ever going to redeem Kylo in any way, which was 100% the way his arc was going the whole time. He didn't really want to go dark side, but embraced it after Luke tried to kill him.

Yes, well done. The Skywalker bloodline. We've established that Skywalkers are a bloodline. The onus put on you was to provide evidence of other bloodlines that you claim are so commonplace in Star Wars. I'm still waiting.

You're repeating yourself now. And again, he only got his powers after the witches did magic on him.

And so, like Luke always has, he puts everyone else before himself, and leaves.

The problem with that heroic notion of ""everyone above me"" is that it can easily spiral into depression- and it does. It's not until Rey hunts him down and tries to beat back into his skull that nobody other than Kylo blames him; Leia, the Resistance, the entire galaxy stills thinks he's a goddamn legend, and never stopped being one. It takes Rey (and Yoda) to pull Luke out of his own head and gets him to look his mistake in the eye and say that he's more powerful than it.

Started and ended with them. And Savage was never even force sensitive, he got his powers from the witches magic.

&gt;the Mortis family

It's a pretty big stretch to include them.

&gt;We don't know a ton about the lineages of other Jedi, but Star Wars has been obsessed about bloodlines

Because there aren't any. Star Wars was in no way at all ""obsessed with bloodlines"". I really don't understand how you can think that.

&gt;to the point that people were speculating Rey was a Kenobi or Skywalker.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why would people speculate that unless this was a *thing* people thought could be a thing?

Because it literally *could* have been a thing... Her lineage was made a mystery *for* fans to speculate on. And the only reason people speculated on Kenobi was because he was the only one outside of a Skywalker that made sense given his relationship with Satine. That's it.

One is asking how there were so many Jedi given they aren't aloud a family (which if anything backs up what I said because the answer is force sensitives aren't decided by who your family is).

As for JJ knowing about Episode VIII before production, here's an interview with Rian Johnson in which he talks about his working relationship with JJ.

&gt; **He was into it. And I remember that I pitched him the story at the very beginning, and he had notes, but he wasn't like, 'Oh my God, what the hell are you doing?' \[Laughs\] No, he was into it because I think he was into the storytelling. He's a great storyteller himself and he saw the potential of each one of these beats. I think he saw it for what we were going for, which is not... we weren't going for, 'Let's subvert a** *Star Wars* **movie.' We were going for 'Let's make a great** *Star Wars* **movie that has things in it that will push the limits of what we can do.'** \-Rian Johnson

The article also says this interesting tidbit about his creative freedom with TLJ.

""Despite the fact that J.J. Abrams reportedly supported Rian Johnson's vision, it also seems like Abrams gave Johnson as much creative freedom as possible to make *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* his own. When asked about whether or not Abrams provided any character input, Johnson explained:""

&gt;**""No, he was really gracious, in just stepping back and giving us a blank slate to work with. The starting point was** ***The Force Awakens*** **script, which is quite a big, expansive, wonderful starting point. In that way, we are drawing directly from his work. But from that point forward it was a blank canvas.""**

There are a ton of ""sources"" out there that will say one thing or another to get clicks, and everyone has their own side of the story. Don't believe everything you read.

Your remarks are valid, the leaked version of JJ idea for episode 8 was better than what Ruin Johnson came up with (I personally have very strong disdain for that particular movie) and the other episode 9 would probably have been better than the mcguffin chase with serveral nonsense we got out of that last movie.

What I think is that everyone involved tried to make their own vision of star wars, instead of going with all the previous material already written for star wars, including George Lucas own notes on the guidelines for the sequel trilogy. Was a very bold move, when you take such a big risk you can either succeed big or fail miserable. Unfortunately, for me, they only made the latter. Mandalorian got me a bit of old star wars taste, but I rewatch the first 6 movies every 2 years or so, and I haven't rewatched those aberrations any time since I saw the last jedi and left the movie completely confused and disgusted.

They did undo a lot of stuff though. TFA shows us an already established First Order with the resources of building another Death Star that is several times larger than the last one. How did the First Order even emerge? How did the New Republic formed at the end of ROTJ lose grip over things so much that the building of such a super weapon went undetected? Who is Snoke and where has he been all this time? In one fell swoop the Starkiller Base destroyed several New Republic planets including the capital planet Hosnian Prime. This pretty much reset the good guys in the sequel trilogy to a small army like they were back in A New Hope. 

TROS answered all my questions from TFA in just one lame manner: somehow Palpatine was alive and he has been pulling the strings all along. Colin Trevorrow's script (from what I read in the OP) didn't even bother answering these questions. 

TLJ felt like one director's hot take on stories in Star Wars. The most positive Jedi who was a beacon of light and headed into battle to save his friends in the original trilogy is now a hermit who has cut off himself from the force. Snoke who was set up in TFA as a villain for the trilogy gets comically murdered. Finn who was set up as a unique character who defected from the First Order is now just a side quest guy. Rey went to Luke for training but she got stronger without it by the end of the movie anyways and her parents are revealed to be nobodies. Luke dies in the end and the Resistance is left as a small group of 400 people. There's nothing left for movie 3 in the trilogy to do other than generic good guys vs bad guys with the good guys coming up on top despite the odds being stacked against them.

Both these movies didn't take anything from the end of the Original Trilogy for the sake of continuity other than just the OG characters themselves.

I'm not claiming that's the case. I'm saying that Star Wars has given us the impression that's the case.

And TRoS further enforces it, while TLJ was directly trying to do the opposite.

The Prequels does literally no such thing.

OK. Stop there.

Palpatines. Darth Maul and his brother, the Mortis family.

We don't know a ton about the lineages of other Jedi, but Star Wars has been obsessed about bloodlines to the point that people were speculating Rey was a Kenobi or Skywalker.

Why would people speculate that unless this was a *thing* people thought could be a thing?

&gt; So please, do tell me about these famous Jedi bloodlines you claim people have been debating for ""decades""...

I personally feel it's not surprising Disney got cold feet and scrapped the plan. They do it constantly with their modern films. All of the live action remakes have elements that try to address fan criticisms over the years. Even if the criticisms became meme jokes. They are obsessed with catering to every fan whim (or perceived one). They have no backbone as a studio making content they believe in. 

Even look at Marvel, everyone is excited about the next Spiderman being more than likely multiverse. And that's Disney reacting to Into The Spider verse being such a huge hit for Sony.

So in TFA you have some great interactions between Poe and Finn. Then later on the same between Finn and Ray. Clearly JJ was setting up a good foundation for these characters to have a friendship similar to the OT crew. The actors chemistry was great on screen but two flaws in the story hurt the future growth of their characters bonds.

1. Poe does not meet Ray. These two have zero development together.

2. TFA’s ending. It ends with a clear intention of picking up with TLJ the moment it ends. In ESB you get the indication that time has passed. That theses characters have grown since we last saw them and that their friendship has too.

Then we pick back up with TLJ. Which doesn’t help the issue at all. It only does further damage. In two ways.

1. It splits them up. Each of the characters goes off on a side mission alone which is great for character development individually but not as a group. 

2. Poe doesn’t meet Ray until the end of TLJ. These two have zero relationship building after two movies.

Finally we have ROS. The one thing this movie did correctly was try and show bonds between these characters on screen. But the problem was that most of the relationships building happened off screen. In the OT we see a lot of banter and things that make you believe they are friends. It allows for the viewer to have the perception of off screen development.

She has more experience than him when she first gets her hands on a lightsaber though. In the movies, it's never explored how Luke learned the specifics of lightsaber fighting.

&gt; Better pilot than Han Solo?  

Have you seen Solo? The first time he even touched the control of the Falcon, a ship he's never flown, he manages to destroy an entire squadron of TIEs in the Maelstrom then kills a Suma-Vaerminoth using the Maw THEN makes a jump with a unstable hyperdrive, escaping getting crush by two huge carbonbergs AND he manages to establish a never beaten record on the Kessel Run.  
It's just that tech and visual effects were more advanced for the Sequels compared to the OT so what she does seems more impressive but Solo confirms that Han is the better pilot.

&gt; Better at Languages than C3PO? 

What the fuck?

She's shown to understand Wookie (While Han manages to SPEAK Wookie) and the Teedo language. Not that improbable considering how cosmopolitan Niima Outpost is.

3PO doesn't know the Ewok language (At first) because nobody even knew they existed and he still manages to pull out a working translation in minutes.

Anyway, J.J. didn’t like Arndt’s plan.  Felt it focused too much on the new characters.  J.J. wanted to make the Old Man Solo film.  So he threw out Arndt’s plan and rewrote Force Awakens to focus more on Han Solo.  Why wasn’t J.J. fired like so many directors after him for taking a Star Wars film in the wrong direction?  Because for years Kennedy and her old producing partner Steven Spielberg have been hyping J.J. as the next Spielberg.  So they gave him a hell of a lot more leeway.

The sequels took the prophecy that drove the first 2 trilogies and said haha jk and made it null and void by making Palpatine live. The worst part is that the sequel trilogy was supposed to be about “the daughter”, Leah. The first trilogy (prequel) was about “the father”, Anakin and the OT was about “the son”, Luke. Overall, it was evident that the writers lacked intimate Star Wars knowledge and were simply trying to make the avengers but with lightsabers.

Don’t get me wrong, the actors played their parts very well and made the movies somewhat enjoyable. As standalone films, they’re fine; as Star Wars films, and as a Star Wars trilogy, they were terrible.

Tbh it also sounds like a mess. It sounds cool in some parts, and probably better than what we got but that’s SO much information to put in one film. Sounds like it would’ve had the same problems where the Knights of Ren still blow. Kylo still has a seemingly meaningless death and the force absorption power seems ridiculous, especially when in the end he only uses it to a) train, b) use it on the guy who taught him it and c) the main character. It makes Poe comedic relief from the sound of it, especially with how much Rey seems to mind control him. Them stealing a star destroyer would take so long that it would either take way too much of the movie considering how much else has to be crammed into it or be criminally skipped over. Obviously we didn’t get it and it could’ve been rad, but IMO I think it would’ve fallen short because of the same Disney politics that made the actual ep. 9 a pretty big failure. 

It definitely seems to improve on a lot of people’s gripes. Having palpatine return in a holocron would’ve been better than being like actually alive, plus keeping holocrons compared to with wayfinders or whatever they were called. Kylo confronting his Vader obsession and coming to the “I’m more powerful than you I don’t need you anymore” conclusion would’ve probably triggered fanboys but it was progression I felt his character needed but was just completely ignored in the RoS. Finn having a story line and not shoe horning in him being force sensitive would’ve been awesome, proving that it’s the choices we make, not our abilities that define us. Rey getting a double sided lightsaber makes SO much sense after her carrying the staff around for two+ films. And it could explain her awkwardness and “luck” with a light saber if she genuinely came in and kicked ass. Giving Lando an appearance without completely relying on his off screen relationships saving the day would’ve played better and probably been hype af. 

EOD I enjoyed 7&amp;9 when I watched them and hated 8, and 7’s the only one I still enjoy, after watching and sitting on nine it just has too many holes and poor choices. Their error was just putting too much trust in way too many people. The story’s all over the place because there wasn’t one/a few confident and creative minds guiding the story, while directors could take artistic liberties with the production aspect. The actors did really well with what they had. I loved Adam Driver, it’s a shame that John Boyega was seemingly just used for promoting that they hired a black actor and was just thrown away after they proved how inclusive they are. 

I wish so much they would’ve just let Dave and Jon do a thrawn series of movies. Or would’ve just left the series to end at episode six and introduce these characters hundreds/thousands of years after the PT and OT, but I think that they decided that would’ve been to bold for their first project.",,,1609703018,{},ghzi4xc,False,t3_kpnza4,False,True,t3_kpnza4,/r/StarWars/comments/kpnza4/the_real_problem_with_the_sequels_that_no_one/ghzi4xc/,1609706581,1,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,,0,[],

The camaraderie and friendship between Han, Luke and Leia was so important in the OT.


In the ST the friendship between the new trio was a real hard sell. 

Why would Poe care that much about Rey and vice versa? They barely knew each other? 

Likewise Poe and Finn. They spent a few minutes together in the beginning of TFA, and then saw each other again at the end of the movie.


In most of TLJ (as always the problemchild of the trilogy) they’re apart from each other. So why are they so close again in TROS?

Rey was supposed to be learning from the Jedi texts, had constructed her own double bladed lightsaber, and was supposed to have been communing with Luke's force ghost.

Kylo would have been an absentee leader of the First Order who would keep running off obsessed with sith artifacts. Haunted by Luke's ghost, he would have fallen deeper into his hatred ans quest for more power until it lead to his ultimate destruction. Also, he would have finally come face to face with and fought Vader in a scene similar to the cave fight on Dagobah.

The movies were badly paced, introducing new characters that were leading to nowhere and misdirecting the attention of the viewer. Besides, it's still Disney's/Lucasarts fault for making us trust that ""in the end everything will make sense"" if the road to that end doesn't make sense. If this finale you say ever aired, maybe the story would be whole, and maybe the arc would be complete, but the journey would still have been mediocre. Take The Mandalorian, for exemple. It's obvious since day 1 that it's leading up to something big. The producers have given us a lot of clues to where to point out attention and our imagination, without giving away too much, and every character that's been introduced has accomplished their function without having to be the plot-changer of the year.

Besides, the talk of Light Side and Dark Side. I don't like it either. The Star Wars univers makes it very clear. The Dark Side is not about using it or not. The Dark Side is corruption. The Balance isn't about using it or not, is about being able to feel those things that make people fall in the Dark Side without having to fall in it. And bearing in mind that the Dark Side will always be there, and you will have to always battle it. That's what I learned from Mortis Arc. You can't beat the Dark Side, you have to always fight to not let it control you, but it will always be there. 

That the Jedi should always and only use the Light Side is undeniable. The lightest use of the Dark Side corrupts everyone with time. What should be about is reviewing what makes a Jedi, and how can one fight his own Dark Side. Isn't that the theme of the Prequels? The Jedi were so lost and so deep in their own traditions that they were unable to see the Dark Side rising from underneath them?

It followed pretty similar plot beats while setting up some interesting premises, but the ending absolutely sucks. 

TLJ is my personal favourite because I love when a movie surprises me. Similar to Empire Strikes Back where they fail at so many things, Luke is failing at his training, Han gets frozen, things end not great for the protagonists, the theme of TLJ is failure and overcoming it. The plans aren't supposed to work it's about persistence. Star Wars was never supposed to just be about the Skywalkers, anyone could be a part of the rebellion and be a Jedi so I loved that Rey's parents weren't anyone important. 

And thank god they killed Snoke he sucked as a character. People bitch about his death, but really what did we know about the Emperor when he showed up? Absolutely nothing, he just appeared, no back story prior to the prequels, no motivations and then Vader kills him, he is literally just a plot device in the original trilogy for Vader to return to the light. Snoke is the exact same he's just something Kyle Ren must overcome but on the flip side he heads into the dark. 

If they had continued this subversion of expectations into the 9th film it would have been much more satisfying. Instead Disney and JJ played it so safe that it was unbearable, Rey being a palpatine and the Emperor returning were the two absolute low points of Star Wars.

The issue with TROS—and I like a lot about TROS—is that it listened to angry fanboys.

I stan the ST, but it’s just messy as hell. And that’s how every other trilogy is.

I think there’s zero chance JJ did the math here, or cares about fleshing out any of the details.

For evidence I refer you to *literally all of JJ’s work*.

I know non-fans tease sci-fi and genre fans about all of our weird knowledge, and I think that’s fine. In the grand scheme of things, the year Rey’s dad was born does not matter - they’re movies in a fictional universe.

*BUT*

There’s no reason to approach it this way other than laziness. The same thing happens in Star Trek, and the writers / creators act like what came before is really dragging them down and holding them back. I’d argue that constraints are actually fuel for creativity, tho, and that for the most part fans griping about canon and continuity is just because they want things to make sense. That these properties are so often handled by people who don’t care about the details is both depressing and doesn’t make a lot of sense.

The time jump explaining Rey’s training with Luke, Hux’s character getting some focus as being secretly bitter about *not* being force sensitive is interesting, Finn actually acting like a war weary ex-stormtrooper and not slapstick comic relief that seems utterly disconnected from the FO.

Honestly I think the biggest issues for the ST is that it never felt like they actually had a lab overall story to tell (the entire set up is more or less 2.0 version of Empire vs rebels) and they seemed so bloody focused on killing off or sidelining the OT characters to prop up new characters that they seemingly had no actual faith in.

I’ve seen reports saying how Disney and Rian said they found writing Luke “very difficult because his presence overshadows everything”.......I’m sorry but if as a writer you find that you can’t write your original characters well enough to not completely be overshadowed by the OT ppl then that’s your problem.

Did they really not think that watching Rey or Finn connect and build relationships with Luke over multiple movie would somehow make us like them less? Or that Leia and Poe couldn’t have got more focus as General and possible protege.....or Han and Ben.

Now I know there were the real world reasons like Harrison Ford really not wanting to come back and Carrie Fisher sadly passing away but even in early stages it just seemed like the ST wanted to sideline/kill off/downplay the the trio from the OT so much.

I think that's just a perception. When you boil something down to a simple good/bad rating, you have to average things out and with a TV show, you have more content to use to create that average. 

Fans praise The Clone Wars and Rebels (and rightly so) because they have some excellent stuff in there, but both those shows contain some flat out awful episodes as well.  I don't think  it's that TV is more successful, it's just that you get more opportunities for redemption. 

&gt;One problem is that a trilogy is only 6 hours of content that you can create and a TV show allows for years and years of new episodes and really fleshed out world building. The movies have to pick and choose the things that they focus on and it leads to a lot of gaps in the story and at times a rushed pace.

That's one of the huge benefits of long form storytelling has over short form. You get to really dig deep rather than trying to cram as much as you can into a short runtime. You have to make choices on what's important to you in that kind of story telling and sometimes people like your choices and sometimes they don't. 

So should Star Wars stick to TV? If by ""stick to TV"" you mean, continue making TV shows, then the answer is a resounding yes. They're doing a great job so far and we've got a lot of cool stuff coming down the pipeline that we probably would never get if they were only doing films. If you're suggesting that they cut films out entirely and only do television, I think that would be a poor choice. When you choose to make a story, you're rolling the dice. Theres equal potential for it to be good or bad. We're probably going to get a bad Star Wars TV show at some point and we're probably going to get another great Star Wars film eventually. 

In my opinion, more Star Wars is never a bad thing. It just means that there's more to find and enjoy.",,,1609699130,{},ghz9p25,False,t3_kpnn7h,False,True,t3_kpnn7h,/r/StarWars/comments/kpnn7h/should_star_wars_just_stick_to_tv/ghz9p25/,1609701591,1,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,,0,[],
