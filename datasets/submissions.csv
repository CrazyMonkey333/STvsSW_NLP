1,"I posted this as a comment in another thread, but it kinda got buried under the rest of the discussion, so I'm kinda hoping to spark some discussion with this.

This is my personal theory based on the lore I've absorbed over the years.

The Force has no ""dark"" or ""light"" side. The Force just is. It's a universal constant, like gravity. ""It binds us and penetrates us."" It's a basic building block of life. Attributing good or evil to a basic building block of life is like trying to say the Earth has the ""good kind"" of gravity, but black holes are pure evil. Good and evil is a measure of intent. This isn't the D&amp;D universe, forces of nature aren't inherently good or evil.

I believe that the Force works as an amplifier of sorts. It increase inherent abilities and allows living beings to do things beyond the scope of what their bodies would normally be able. Some force-users have different latent abilities, which is why some are more skilled in certain areas than others, and why select few have specific unique abilities that can't be replicated by others.

As an extension of this, the Force amplifies the emotions of the user. Anger is amplified into rage, love is amplified into obsession, anxiety is amplified into fear, confidence is amplified into pride. We see this time and time again with both Sith and Jedi who are lax in their restraint. Their flaws become exaggerated over time and they ""fall to the dark side,"" which is to say that they allow the Force to stoke the worst part of themselves.

This doesn't even fly in the face of the ideas laid out by the movies or the OT. If you notice, the Jedi don't ever encourage perceived ""positive"" emotions like love and joy; they encourage *detachment*. They teach their padawans from a very young age to cut themselves off from emotion altogether. Contrary to the Sith who stoke their emotions by delving deep into the Force, the Jedi are taught to avoid emotions altogether and only touch the surface of what the Force can truly do. Yes, Jedi believe in a Light and Dark side, but all that means is that the pragmatic knowledge of how the Force works has been couched in mysticism and the personification of human intent in a universal constant that has no ability to actually show conscious intent. This is absolutely normal for how religions and dogma form naturally over time, much like ancient Earth civilizations attributing supernatural forces to the sun moving in the sky or the changing of the weather.",My theory on how the Force works,i posted this as a comment in another thread  but it kinda got buried under the rest of the discussion  so i m kinda hoping to spark some discussion with this this is my personal theory based on the lore i ve absorbed over the years the force has no  dark  or  light  side  the force just is  it s a universal constant  like gravity   it binds us and penetrates us   it s a basic building block of life  attributing good or evil to a basic building block of life is like trying to say the earth has the  good kind  of gravity  but black holes are pure evil  good and evil is a measure of intent  this isn t the d amp d universe  forces of nature aren t inherently good or evil i believe that the force works as an amplifier of sorts  it increase inherent abilities and allows living beings to do things beyond the scope of what their bodies would normally be able  some force users have different latent abilities  which is why some are more skilled in certain areas than others  and why select few have specific unique abilities that can t be replicated by others as an extension of this  the force amplifies the emotions of the user  anger is amplified into rage  love is amplified into obsession  anxiety is amplified into fear  confidence is amplified into pride  we see this time and time again with both sith and jedi who are lax in their restraint  their flaws become exaggerated over time and they  fall to the dark side   which is to say that they allow the force to stoke the worst part of themselves this doesn t even fly in the face of the ideas laid out by the movies or the ot  if you notice  the jedi don t ever encourage perceived  positive  emotions like love and joy  they encourage  detachment   they teach their padawans from a very young age to cut themselves off from emotion altogether  contrary to the sith who stoke their emotions by delving deep into the force  the jedi are taught to avoid emotions altogether and only touch the surface of what the force can truly do  yes  jedi believe in a light and dark side  but all that means is that the pragmatic knowledge of how the force works has been couched in mysticism and the personification of human intent in a universal constant that has no ability to actually show conscious intent  this is absolutely normal for how religions and dogma form naturally over time  much like ancient earth civilizations attributing supernatural forces to the sun moving in the sky or the changing of the weather my theory on how the force works

1,"1.The OT is basically reverted

 \-The Galaxy is the same as we left it after Revenge of The Sith

 \-Luke reverts back to a loser

 \-Han Solo reverts back to a pirate

 \-Leia is the head of a rebellion, again

 \-The New Republic has fallen

 \-The New Order is in control

2.Vader sacrifice is useless, as is Anakin's ""Chosen One"" prophecy

 \-You could write Anakin out of the entire saga and won't affect the story at all, as Palpatine would probably take control as he orchestrated the Clone Wars before he had his eyes on Anakin. And Rey would eventually kill him as she is ""As powerful as all the Jedi"" or whatever.

 \-Anakin's ""Chosen One"" prophecy is pretty much wrong, and he's not the Chosen One in canon anymore. There's still a Chosen One, so the prophecy was true.

3.Luke didn't kill Vader because he hoped there was some good in him, but tries to kill Ben Solo in his sleep.

 \-I think this one was specifically made to intentionally upset people.

 \-Pretty much Luke causes the redemption of the second most evil guy in the universe by having some hope that there's still some good in him, but tries to KILL his nephew because he saw a glimpse of evil in him? If you can't see this scene as an attack on people who like SW and nothing else, I am sorry, you lack of conscience npc consoomer.

4.There was no progress, no story, they just light-retcon the OT so they can piss people off and do activism.

 \-Look, the story had a natural flow, you just can't retcon the OT, why not retcon the Prequels? Why don't we have it that the next trilogy is about how Rey's jedi order falls after an Emperor takes over the galaxy after he orchestrates a Clone War?

1,"I LOVED the season finale of Mando. However, something is really bothering me that kind of took me out of the moment during Luke’s return: the way his lightsaber looks. It’s insane to me that LUCASFILM of all people would get this detail wrong. When he swings his lightsaber around, it looks like he’s waving a big glow stick or toy lightsaber (which I know the actor is) but that is WRONG. Every single lightsaber from every movie has always looked the same: a white blade that, when moved fast, fans out while keeping its (green/blue/purple/red/gold) glow around the white blade. 

For reference, watch the ‘hallway scenes’ from both the end of Rogue One and the season two finale of Mandalorian back-to-back. Notice how Vader’s blade looks when he swings it. It stays white and fans out. Then watch Luke’s hallway scene and notice that it literally looks like he’s waving a giant toy glow stick through the air and the blade of his lightsaber disappears. 

Whatever special effects company responsible for Luke’s scenes messed it up BIG TIME. There are literally YouTube videos of homemade lightsaber effects that are more accurate to the films. It’s like they didn’t even bother to look at any of the movies or shows for reference and just slapped something on. I haven’t seen anyone else notice or talk about how the lightsaber effect is wrong. This is huge to me. They messed up how lightsabers look in STAR WARS.

Hi,
I was recently convinced to watch TCW and after borrowing the Blu Ray box set I finally decided to watch it and I could not believe how unimpressed I was although the first and second season was fun and clearly improved from series one to two but the overall result was average.

However from series three to five I couldn’t believe how great it got I fully get the hype it maybe the best thing in SW. the increased level of characters for so many was great.

&gt;Kenobi’s increased level of detail such as Duchess Satine and his interactions with Maul and much more of Kenobi’s famous wit and banter

&gt;Anakin’s increased dabbles with the dark side were also very good to see as it showed a much greyer Anakin through out TCW slowly using the dark side more and more and events such as Ahsoka Tano being expelled from the order

&gt;Ahsoka Tano has also became one of my top SW characters through out the show she is like a mirror image of Anakin in so many ways instead of choosing the dark at the key moments she sticks with the light even if that’s no longer with the Jedi.

&gt;Darth Maul seeing his return rebuild and re assertion to a place of prominence was fantastic with his brother. Seeing his face of against his replacement Dooku and former Master Sidious 

&gt;My favourite character development however is Dooku he’s so much more than just as Sith Lord he’s more he’s an idealist with grand ideas of bringing down the republic and he uses the Sith to try and do this seeing him through out TCW is great and he’s so cool especially when fighting the night sisters 

There’s is many many more including the clones themselves also it’s so good to see how much development TCW causes to the whole prequel era and turns a small line in A New Hope to something truly special and the cartoon nature of it I think gives the writers freedoms to world build movies don’t have due to CGI and finical restrictions

Do you think TCW is SW at its best? If not what is it? Is rebels as good? Are you looking forward to the Bad Batch?

I was reading an article that mentions how the physics of how hyperspace works in previous cannon means that this maneuver wouldn’t be possible.  

But what really bugs me is that if this cruiser, piloted by one person, can wipe out a flagship, then this tactic would be used constantly in a war.  Autopilot suicide ships (or just hyperspace jumping projectiles) would be devastating weapons.  This one plot hole changes Star Wars space battles as we know them.

This is not a Prequel Meme, this is serious. Darth Plagueis’ ability was described as “being able to manipulate the midichlorians to create life.” From what we’ve seen of Force Heal, this ability is very similar to that of what Palpatine described. 

This would help the ability fit into the canon better, for now we know it was used in the past by powerful Sith. The only people who we have seen is it are Rey, granddaughter of Palpatine, Kylo Ren, son of Leia Skywalker, and Grougu, a possible survivor of Order 66, who has been seen to do other more Dark side abilities, such as Force choke.

You see, the biggest criticisms I see are that there was no real plan on where to go, that Kathleen Kennedy and Iger rushed them out, that Johnson ruined everything TFA set up, etc. However, none of those is the issue. After really looking into this, I believe this is what ultimately crippled the sequels: the scrapping of the Colin Trevorrow's original episode 9, Duel of The Fates.

Duel of The Fates is perhaps the single most interesting cancelled film I've ever read about. It's not a traditional cancelled movie in that it's pretty unnecessary and something better gets made, it is literally the climax of the entire ST and makes the trilogy actually feel like a coherent story. I won't detail the entire story but I'll tell you interesting tidbits. There is also concept art out there that is A M A Z I N G!!! The best concept art I've ever seen. However, I won't link it, as idk if I'm allowed.

- Rey was meant to harness both the dark side and the light side. She was meant to learn from Luke's mistake in trying to surpass the darkness and Anakin and Ben's mistake in embracing it too much. She was meant to be the first Jedi to truly embrace being human. The film would end with her teaching this to Broom Boy.

- Finn was meant to lead an uprising of ex Stormtroopers and others on a post apocalyptic Coruscant. He was going to become the leader he had been set up as and use his experience of seeing the slaver kids to become a leading force in stopping oppressors by leading the oppressed into battle.


- Luke was going to haunt Kylo Ren in the film. ""See you around, kid"".

- The final battle between Rey and Ben was to be on Mortis. I believe this this why Rebels reintroduced the Father and Son and all. To remind viewers for this film.

- Also the Darksaber was going to be in it. Perhaps that's why Rebels brung that back too.

- There was STRONG ties to Jedi Fallen Order. A major character was a Zeffo and also Rey's lightsaber was modeled a lot like Cal's duel blade. It also was like her staff in a way.


I could go on. But do you see what I'm getting at?

So here's what I believe: Disney DID have somewhat of an idea of where to go. The prequels were about evil, the OT was about good and this trilogy was to be about balance. They also had vague ideas on where these characters would end up. Finn leading an uprising of stormtroopers and oppressed people and Rey being a gray Jedi. However, I don't believe they worked out small details such as Rey's parents, Snoke, etc and left that up to the filmmakers.

So why was this scrapped? Rumor has it that Trevorrow couldn't make it work without Fisher. So they brought JJ back. JJ started working on TROS in the dead heat of TLJ's backlash and it looks like to me that him and Disney got cold feet on going further with the story so instead they cancelled it and tried to rush up something a lot more safe. 

Duel of The Fates is fascinating to me in that it's not only the climax of the ST, but it's literally what Disney was building to. Rebels, JFO and the sequels all were leading to a finale that just didn't happen. This was meant to be the story. I find it truly bizarre that a studio was so shaken by backlash to a film that they scrapped what was the single most important film in their entire series and replaced it with what seemed to be more of an apology for the last film. 

Sorry for the essay, but what do you guys think? This was really been a subject that has really fascinated me as of late and I'm wondering if anyone else agrees.

1,"Star Wars seems to have a much higher success rate when it comes to executing TV shows vs movies. Why is this?

One problem is that a trilogy is only 6 hours of content that you can create and a TV show allows for years and years of new episodes and really fleshed out world building. The movies have to pick and choose the things that they focus on and it leads to a lot of gaps in the story and at times a rushed pace.

1,"Honestly, while I have seen the meme about the ""two Jedi, two Sith"" aspect of this, I think on a serious note that this line shows how Obi-Wan embodies the Jedi mindset - completely unaware of their own hypocrisy. 

Obi-Wan was a good man, but he was inhibited and caused problems through the mindset of the Jedi Order. He was emotionally unavailable for the parts of Anakin's life that brought him the greatest pain, insisting simply it was 'not the Jedi way' (even if he was better about it than other Jedi masters). That's not to say he wasn't correct - what Anakin felt and did wasn't the Jedi way at all, but it didn't mean that it was wrong. 

The Prequels, to me, display not only Sidious's plan to plunge the galaxy into darkness, but show how the Jedi Order is fundamentally flawed in the Republic Era, seeking to purge its members of emotion when the Council is guided throughout the Clone Wars by fear. Anakin is forbidden from having attachments to his mother and to Padme, and being forced to constantly bury his feelings leads to that repressed anger causing him to have a moment of weakness. 

Contrast the post-Clone Wars Jedi/Light side force users. Ashoka Tano left the Jedi Order, but still fought on the side of peace and justice, expressing herself and embodying the mission of the Jedi while acknowledging their faults. Kanan Jarrus clearly had attachments and emotions that weighed on him, but was still a powerful Jedi who could control himself. At the end of Episode VI, Luke certainly lets his fear of losing Leia cause him to lose control, but what brings him back isn't merely Jedi training; it's seeing his father beneath that mask that keeps him reserved and in control. 

The Jedi in the Prequel Era believed they were absolutely right and that the Force was balanced as long as they kept complete control. They are often overshadowed by the absolute evil that is Darth Sidious, but it's not an unfounded claim that they were power hungry and warmongering at the height of their power. Even if that is too bold a claim, one can't deny that they were interfering with matters and repressing that which they blindly feared, which led to their downfall. 

Obi-Wan, as good a man as he is, bought into this archaic definition of the light side of the Force, and as a result could not properly relate to Anakin and help him. In the line I quoted, he truly believes that the Jedi were blameless for what has become of the galaxy and Anakin, and he doesn't see that even if the galaxy is still out of balance, removing the Jedi Order from dominance was a necessary part of a shift towards true balance. 

As one last additional point, the people of Bardotta during the ""Disappeared"" arc of the Clone Wars were strongly implied to be representations of the Light side of the force, being peaceful and passively using the Force to see the future, rather than using it for power and violence. The people of Bardotta, including the Queen, did not shy away from their emotions, but also did not let those emotions control them.","""You were supposed to bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!""",honestly  while i have seen the meme about the  two jedi  two sith  aspect of this  i think on a serious note that this line shows how obi wan embodies the jedi mindset   completely unaware of their own hypocrisy  obi wan was a good man  but he was inhibited and caused problems through the mindset of the jedi order  he was emotionally unavailable for the parts of anakin s life that brought him the greatest pain  insisting simply it was  not the jedi way   even if he was better about it than other jedi masters   that s not to say he wasn t correct   what anakin felt and did wasn t the jedi way at all  but it didn t mean that it was wrong  the prequels  to me  display not only sidious s plan to plunge the galaxy into darkness  but show how the jedi order is fundamentally flawed in the republic era  seeking to purge its members of emotion when the council is guided throughout the clone wars by fear  anakin is forbidden from having attachments to his mother and to padme  and being forced to constantly bury his feelings leads to that repressed anger causing him to have a moment of weakness  contrast the post clone wars jedi light side force users  ashoka tano left the jedi order  but still fought on the side of peace and justice  expressing herself and embodying the mission of the jedi while acknowledging their faults  kanan jarrus clearly had attachments and emotions that weighed on him  but was still a powerful jedi who could control himself  at the end of episode vi  luke certainly lets his fear of losing leia cause him to lose control  but what brings him back isn t merely jedi training  it s seeing his father beneath that mask that keeps him reserved and in control  the jedi in the prequel era believed they were absolutely right and that the force was balanced as long as they kept complete control  they are often overshadowed by the absolute evil that is darth sidious  but it s not an unfounded claim that they were power hungry and warmongering at the height of their power  even if that is too bold a claim  one can t deny that they were interfering with matters and repressing that which they blindly feared  which led to their downfall  obi wan  as good a man as he is  bought into this archaic definition of the light side of the force  and as a result could not properly relate to anakin and help him  in the line i quoted  he truly believes that the jedi were blameless for what has become of the galaxy and anakin  and he doesn t see that even if the galaxy is still out of balance  removing the jedi order from dominance was a necessary part of a shift towards true balance  as one last additional point  the people of bardotta during the  disappeared  arc of the clone wars were strongly implied to be representations of the light side of the force  being peaceful and passively using the force to see the future  rather than using it for power and violence  the people of bardotta  including the queen  did not shy away from their emotions  but also did not let those emotions control them  you were supposed to bring balance to the force  not leave it in darkness  
1,"**TL;DR** Luke, Leia and Han all had amazing chemistry as characters and actors. This is lacking in the sequel movies, which makes it much harder to care. 

**Originals**

There are obviously so many reasons why the OG trilogy are such great movies - the special effects, the visuals, the perfect pacing (especially in Empire), the well written characters, intriguing story, etc.

However I think one of the main reasons why the original Star Wars are just so fun and lovable is the chemistry between Luke, Han, and Leia. Their friendship grows so naturally and organically in A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back that by the time ROTJ came out the audience genuinely believes that these three rebels were life long BFFs who would take a bullet for each other. Not only did they all have great banter off each other as well as some heart felt moments, the script always delivered these scenes at the exact right time so that it was always believable. 


**Sequels**

If you compare this to the subsequent Star Wars films, this element is missing. Disney clearly tried to set up Rey, Fin, and Po as sort of the new Luke, Han, and Leia, and in my opinion it just didn't work at all. Apart from the fact that they split up the band too early, the chemistry between these characters always was a little off. It was like when you meet a friend of a friend at a party and you want to become closer with them but you just don't really vibe that well or have much to talk about...that's sort of how I felt the main sequel characters felt about each other. All of their ""friendship"" moments were unearned, and as a result felt fake and forced.

1,"The Hondo scene might be the most controversial scene in the entire series: you either loved it because it was a fantastically well-done scene that looked outstanding, or you hate it because it uprooted the entire Star Wars franchise. The age-old question of ""why not just load a droid into an X-Wing, aim it at the Death Star, and tell it to punch it?"" was answered, and it felt kinda rough. I love this scene, but thinking back on it after I had left the theatres kinda left a sour taste in my mouth. But I think I see now how that scene didn't screw with the series one bit.

Ignoring the whole ""that was a one in a million shot"" line from Rise of Skywalker (because as much as I appreciated J.J. Abrahams trying to patch it up that was kinda cheesy, won't lie) there are a couple of other things that make this whole plan fall apart.

For one, droids. The whole reason this works is that droids exist, so the Rebels don't have to just throw themselves into ships. Instead, they just load up a droid, tell it where to aim, and boom, no more Death Star. The issue here though is that droids aren't exactly the brightest things in the galaxy. There are exceptions like R2 and K-2SO, but for the most part, droids eff up, hell, even R2 does. In Revenge of the Sith, Obi-Wan tells R2 to activate the elevator and R2 does but makes it go down instead of up. Why? Because Obi-Wan didn't actually specify which way he wanted to go, so R2 just flipped a coin and it didn't work out. Furthermore, in that same movie Grievous tells a few droids to just go back to their stations and man the ship. They do and die to lightsabers moments later because they followed orders. See what I'm getting at? ""Hey, R2, we want you to fly to these coordinates, aim at the big-assed Death Star, and punch it."" That won't end well, he will get gunned out of the sky by Ties long before he even gets into position. So the Rebellion would more likely have to send dozens of ships to overwhelm the Ties and get a real chance of getting a shot through. And even still, eventually, The Empire or the First Order would go ""oh, so this is their new tactic?"" And then they'd just send out a few Ties to slow down the fleet, and then GTFO once they have the chance, problem solved.

However, even if Droids were brilliant and made every shot and dodged the ties perfectly, the biggest issue that can't ever really be fixed is resources. The Empire has unlimited resources, they're the freaking empire. The Rebels blew up the Death Star and they were back rebuilding it two movies later, they don't lose money, just time. The Rebels, on the other hand, do *not* have unlimited resources. In The Last Jedi, they are all fitting in one freaking cruiser, they have nothing to their name save their guns, each other, and the few escape pods that actually made it. At that moment, one X-Wing is probably worth as much if not more to them than a Star Destroyer is to First Order. But even in the older days, we always see that the Ties come out like a swarm of freaking bees while you could probably count the number of X-Wings and Y-Wings we can see. The Empire has unlimited resources, but the Rebels do not, and throwing away ships and droids and not to mention all of the fuel *inside* the ships, they wouldn't be able to afford it. Which also makes sense why they mention ""Hondo maneuvers"" at the end of Rise of Skywalker, they're at their last breath, it's do or die, so resources just don't matter anymore.

TL;DR: Droids are dumb and it'd take dozens to actually be able to dodge all of the Tie Fighters long enough to line up and take a shot as Hondo did; and while the Empire and the First Order can lose resources and really lose nothing but time, the Rebels and the Alliance can't afford to throw away dozens of ships every day to take out one Star Destroyer.

1,"So first off. This probably sounds weird, liked Star Wars, but never really watched the movies? What does that mean?

As a kid I watched the prequels, but never really got going with the originals, as I was disappointed about the quality, or maybe just that it wasn’t what I already knew.. (Should have watched it in release order). Also when I was a kid I played a lot of LEGO Star Wars, which meant that I knew almost almost all scenes going through the movies again.

So this time I wanted to do it the right way, and watch in release order. 

(Ranking in the bottom)

[b]New Hope[\b]

The quality here was much better than I expected. Great movie that really made me wanna continue my rewatch. It is probably the movie I liked the least out of the originals, but that could be because it took a bit longer getting started, because it had to introduce the characters. That said, I also missed some more Jedi action.

[b]Empire[\b]
Great movie all the way throughout the movie. I understand why it is the highest rated Star Wars movie on IMDb. There is something going on all the time and a lot of good battles. I just still don’t know if I liked it more than ROJ. I think, if I didn’t already know Vader was Luke’s father, that would have made it even more epic.

[b]Return of the Jedi[\b]
I really liked this movie as well. At this point you have really started to know the actors and it had a great ending. Really liked the inclusion of the Ewoks. The first part with Jabba probably took a bit too long for my taste, but that’s about it. Probably my second favorite of the originals.

[b]The Phantom Menace[\b]
This movie has to be my least favorite out of them all. It was simply just boring at times. I’m glad I had played a lot of Lego Star Wars, as that made me nostalgic about the settings. Darth Maul is also a pretty cool villain, but overall the movie was just underwhelming.

[b]Attack of the Clones[\b]
This was the most positive surprise. I had checked the IMDb ratings before watching and saw that this movie ranked last with TPM. Even though I understand that the dialogue was really poor, I really found this movie a LOT more entertaining. The arena fight was very cool with all the Jedi’s together. Maybe it’s just my nostalgia?

[b]Revenge of the Sith[\b]
This was the movie I had in mind before starting the “rewatch”. The final battle with Anakin and Obi Wan was just as I remembered it, very powerful. That’s how I would describe that movie, extremely powerful. What I really like about it is how the Jedi’s fuck up as well. Yeah, they had a lot going against them, but they could have prevented it. Great movie! 

[b]The Force Awakens[\b]
Nice movie as well. Cool to see the old actors in action again! Maybe the story was a bit similar to things we know, but I generally liked the movie. I also like Kylo Ren as a villain. The whole “planet that could destroy other planets” thing is a bit outdated though.

[b]The last Jedi[\b]
At some points it was a bit boring, but on the other hand it doesn’t always have to be big explosions. I liked the ending though. Also the duality of Kylo Ren’s character is pretty good, and a bit better portraited than Vader’s imo.

[b]The Rise of Skywalker[\b]
A bit of a surprise as well. It was one of the lowest ranked movies on IMDb, but I actually quite liked it. It was quite epic at times. But that’s also probably the biggest negative. The Star Wars franchise seems to have reached a level, where they can’t follow the rules of the first movies, which can be a bit weird to watch. Suddenly they can do something you had no idea was possible. I did like the fact that Palpatine returned though, it could be seen as unrealistic, but I found it quite fitting that he had the ability to bring himself back, as he promised Anakin in the prequels. They should have some credit though, for coming up with new ideas imo.

I really liked all the movies in general, and I have now found myself in Star Wars communities on Reddit, so all in all a very cool franchise!
Here is my rankings, some of the movies were hard to rank though. 5-7 I’m unsure about the order.

(Best to worst)
1. Empire strikes back
2. Return of the Jedi
3. Revenge of the sith
4. A new hope
5. Rise of Skywalker
6. Attack of the clones
7. The Last Jedi
8. Force awakens
9. The Phantom Menace",Always known and liked Star Wars. But this Christmas I decided to do my first real watch through of the 9 trilogy movies.,so first off  this probably sounds weird  liked star wars  but never really watched the movies  what does that mean as a kid i watched the prequels  but never really got going with the originals  as i was disappointed about the quality  or maybe just that it wasn t what i already knew    should have watched it in release order   also when i was a kid i played a lot of lego star wars  which meant that i knew almost almost all scenes going through the movies again so this time i wanted to do it the right way  and watch in release order   ranking in the bottom  b new hope  b the quality here was much better than i expected  great movie that really made me wanna continue my rewatch  it is probably the movie i liked the least out of the originals  but that could be because it took a bit longer getting started  because it had to introduce the characters  that said  i also missed some more jedi action  b empire  b great movie all the way throughout the movie  i understand why it is the highest rated star wars movie on imdb  there is something going on all the time and a lot of good battles  i just still don t know if i liked it more than roj  i think  if i didn t already know vader was luke s father  that would have made it even more epic  b return of the jedi  b i really liked this movie as well  at this point you have really started to know the actors and it had a great ending  really liked the inclusion of the ewoks  the first part with jabba probably took a bit too long for my taste  but that s about it  probably my second favorite of the originals  b the phantom menace  b this movie has to be my least favorite out of them all  it was simply just boring at times  i m glad i had played a lot of lego star wars  as that made me nostalgic about the settings  darth maul is also a pretty cool villain  but overall the movie was just underwhelming  b attack of the clones  b this was the most positive surprise  i had checked the imdb ratings before watching and saw that this movie ranked last with tpm  even though i understand that the dialogue was really poor  i really found this movie a lot more entertaining  the arena fight was very cool with all the jedi s together  maybe it s just my nostalgia  b revenge of the sith  b this was the movie i had in mind before starting the  rewatch   the final battle with anakin and obi wan was just as i remembered it  very powerful  that s how i would describe that movie  extremely powerful  what i really like about it is how the jedi s fuck up as well  yeah  they had a lot going against them  but they could have prevented it  great movie   b the force awakens  b nice movie as well  cool to see the old actors in action again  maybe the story was a bit similar to things we know  but i generally liked the movie  i also like kylo ren as a villain  the whole  planet that could destroy other planets  thing is a bit outdated though  b the last jedi  b at some points it was a bit boring  but on the other hand it doesn t always have to be big explosions  i liked the ending though  also the duality of kylo ren s character is pretty good  and a bit better portraited than vader s imo  b the rise of skywalker  b a bit of a surprise as well  it was one of the lowest ranked movies on imdb  but i actually quite liked it  it was quite epic at times  but that s also probably the biggest negative  the star wars franchise seems to have reached a level  where they can t follow the rules of the first movies  which can be a bit weird to watch  suddenly they can do something you had no idea was possible  i did like the fact that palpatine returned though  it could be seen as unrealistic  but i found it quite fitting that he had the ability to bring himself back  as he promised anakin in the prequels  they should have some credit though  for coming up with new ideas imo i really liked all the movies in general  and i have now found myself in star wars communities on reddit  so all in all a very cool franchise here is my rankings  some of the movies were hard to rank though  5 7 i m unsure about the order  best to worst 1  empire strikes back2  return of the jedi3  revenge of the sith4  a new hope5  rise of skywalker6  attack of the clones7  the last jedi8  force awakens9  the phantom menacealways known and liked star wars  but this christmas i decided to do my first real watch through of the 9 trilogy movies

1,"Disney has announced so many new promising Star Wars projects which I am really hyped for. However on their list one of my favorite stories is missing: Darth Vader. 

Yes, I know Vader has six films describing his whole life, was in the Clone Wars and will be part in the Kenobi Series. But his biggest screen time is as Anakin Skywalker. When he becomes Vader he shifts to be the antagonist and we barely see him anymore. And even more there is one big hole in his story where we never see him: the Jedi Purge.

I want to see one of the most powerful Sith hunting and destroying the Jedi. The series could start in the Jedi Temple in Episode III where we only get to see him march in and ignite his light saber. It could show how powerful Vader is when using his anger and hate fighting multiple Jedi and Temple Guards alongside the Clone Troopers. It could then focus on him searching and killing different Jedi similar to Star Killer in the Force Unleashed. It could even feature Vader destroying new Rebell cells. And since he is the Bad Guy this opens up for a fresh and new perspective in a series. It could show the bad guys win over and over again, maybe even killing some protagonists from other movies / series.

The ending scene in Rogue One in which Vader teared through the rebels was in my opinion one of the best scenes in the entire movie. I want to see more of that! I want to see the true power of Darth Vader! I want to see Jedis running and hiding from him because of his strength! I want to see epic sword fights between Vader and surviving Jedi Master! I want to see Vader win!

Since she's not in the Skywalker family tree, I always forget that she's Anakin's sister-in-law.

Is there any canon appearances from her post episode III? And if so, did she have any children? If so, Luke and Leia have cousins out in the universe they've likely never heard of. If it hasn't already happened, it would be cool to learn them learn of one another and meet.

I also know Vader went to Naboo in a recent comic - if she had children perhaps he could have met his remaining family and mourned the death of his kids.","Did Padme's sister Sola ever have children?

1,"I’ve seen many people laugh about the duel between Obi Wan and Vader, calling it a joke, and a terrible fight scene in general. [The comments on the YouTube video](https://youtu.be/8kpHK4YIwY4) show that many people do not rate this fight scene at all.

I used to be in that camp, as someone who grew up as the prequels were releasing, surrounded by the marketing showing all the flashy and extremely high-octane duels - the ANH fight did seem slow and boring to me. But as I’ve grown up I’ve come to appreciate it far more. I don’t think it’s the best fight scene in Star Wars but I do think it’s one of the most realistic, and not as bad as some people think.

We all know Lucas took huge inspiration from old samurai films, and [watching this duel from Harakiri,](https://youtu.be/rn4FY_k9FyE?t=135) you can clearly see how he was trying to emulate this Japanese sword technique and dueling style. Both duelists are extremely guarded rather than highly aggressive, and they make smaller slight movements to probe their opponents rather than swinging their swords around. I don’t think it’s flawless and it doesn’t perfectly reproduce the samurai dueling style - Obi Wan does a ridiculous pirouette - but I do think people are too quick to dismiss it as a bad fight scene. 

Lucas completely changing the fight style and lightsaber philosophy in the prequels certainly didn’t help people’s attitude towards the OT dueling - they are two completely different styles and a more realistic approach would appear more boring compared to something superhuman. (Also funnily enough [Obi Wan uses a move](https://youtu.be/8kpHK4YIwY4?t=85) that far more closely resembles the [fencing technique ‘circular parry’](https://youtu.be/2nv84vvaP9M?t=210) than what [this video claims Obi Wan and Anakin do in ROTS.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/koh4yi/this_is_an_exceptional_explanation_for_that_one/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

1,"I don't know about all of you but I for sure feel redeemed when it comes to being a Star Wars fan in general after watching Mando. Especially with respect to the way a Jedi should fight. For so long, people have bashed the prequel fight scenes as being overdone and too fanciful. These folks found it refreshing to see clumsy, ""grounded"" fight scenes in the sequel trilogy. An in-universe defense of this sloppiness has been that Rey, Finn, Kylo, and even Luke never had the extensive training that all Jedi had pre Order 66.

Spoilers

Well I think we can finally put that whole crapshoot to rest after seeing the finale of Season 2. The choreography in the final scenes were flowing and stylistic, more reminiscent of the Prequels than even RotJ.

The sequel trilogy's ""grounded"" fight scenes and Lightsaber battles fundamentally misunderstand the way a Jedi fights. A Force User can reach out and feel their surroundings. When fully in tune with the force, they effortlessly make perfect movements, dodging and striking with dance-like precision. Like a kind of spidey-sense, their movements are guided by the Force.

So yeah, I feel like JF and DF and all the folks involved in Mando actually get this, and wanted to make up for putting us through years of garbage choreography.

Like its not like the jedi are emotionless beings, the jedi were still friends of each others and imagine losing that many friends that soon

And all the hard work put into the clone wars went all to waste, like even obi Wan, imagine how he must have felt cutting anakin and hearing how anakin hates obi wan

Idk if it's just me but it hurts me as I end clone wars knowing what is going to happen (order 66)

1,"1. A Mandalorian bounty hunter game. They have already set up a rough outline of it with the show; go from planet to planet doing missions, certain planets in each sector would have a mandalorian covert that would serve as a hub where you can upgrade your gear, buy items or even recruit people for a job (in an online game setting, this could be where you set up coop missions). 

As you do more main missions you can unlock more gear like a jetpack, or the scope that goes on the helmet, etc. 

And there could be special beast hunting quests that unlock different insignias you can wear (maybe different insignias give different bonuses). 

There could be different NCPs throughout the different planets that you could recruit to permanently join your crew and you can train and upgrade them(kinda like how Din tried to recruit Kuil)

You can buy different ships or upgrade them, with your ship determining how many you can have in your crew. There could also be certain missions that you can only do if you have a ship with enough cargo space. 

There would be different Mandalorian clans, either for story, or instead of choosing a class at the beginning of the game, you choose what clan you start in, with each clan choice having different advantages and drawbacks, such as gear available to them or upgrades, etc (maybe they each have different starting worlds, or maybe everyone does a tutorial on Mandalore and then the purge happens forcing the clans to scatter)


2. Galactic Conquest. For those of you who played the original Star Wars Battlefront 2, you're probably familiar with the game mode Galactic Conquest. For those of you who never got the chance, the game was like this; you could choose to start as one of the 4 main forces (Galactic Republic, Confederation Separatists, The Empire, or The Rebellion), your choice determined both your enemy and the map. (Republic vs Separatists &amp; Empire vs Rebellion). You go to a map showing the worlds, about 10 worlds usually 7 in enemy hands and 3 on your side, and both sides each get one ship. The idea was to move the ship around the board like a chess piece choosing which planets to attack, or if two ships ended up on the same space there would be a space battle. But the part I loved was each side started with one type of unit available, and as you earn credits from your battles, you can permanently unlock other units or you can use the credits to buy more ships for the board or single battle upgrades like extra armor or the best one, bring a hero. So there was a lot of strategy in how to spend your credits. 

My idea, have a game dedicated solely to this game mode. They can even take out the space battle part if they want to keep that in Squadrons, and it honestly doesn't even need a story mode, because each conquest is its own story. 

You could have the original 4, plus First Order and The Resistance and if you want to be funny they could have a mode that allows you to choose your enemy. So you could have First Order vs The Republic or even Rebels vs Resistance. 

They could add more customization, so that the different classes that can be unlocked can be upgraded. And even though you start with only one type of unit at the beginning each time, you could customize their looks (ie. the troops under Ahsoka during the siege of Mandalore)

The only problem i can think of is online play, because a single match would take forever. So there would have to be a way to put the match on hold, if it's 1v1. For massive multiplayer, my thought would be to have lobbies that vote for next move each time, and then for public matches like that, instead of the group using credits, we each get them individually to unlock and upgrade for yourself, with one upgrade chain for each of the 6 armies (earning separate credits that only work for each specific army)

1,"This post is SUPER long so whoever reads everything, thank you, I had fun writing it. 

I’ve been really thinking about the purpose behind the sequels lately, and honestly ever since the conclusion of the Skywalker saga. I think the sequel trilogy was mainly about Ben and Luke’s characters. Yes Rey is the main character but she’s more of a lifeline for our broken heroes, and that’s why I think she’s so important, allow me to elaborate.

Rey is the definition of a Jedi. She’s pure, kind, selfless, powerful, smart, and very hardworking. She’s everything you want in a Jedi. She has very little flaws in her character which some make the argument that it hurts the sequels or her character or whatever, but I kind of have a different take on that.

Rey’s amazing qualities are essential to the conclusion of the Skywalker saga. She’s not unflawed, but she’s pretty close to it. I’ve met pure souls like her in my own lifetime, they exist, to me it’s not unbelievable: not everyone has to go through some ginormous struggle. And like I said, she still has brief moments of darkness or weakness, but I personally never thought (like ever) she would turn to the dark side, and that’s the key to all of this. 

This is where I’ll lose a lot of you. I’m personally someone who thinks Luke Skywalker was handled almost perfectly in the sequels. I think his bloodline has an affect on his mind. I think his momentary lapse with Ben was believable especially given Anakin’s story in the prequels. MANY OF YOU.........don’t agree with that. And that’s fine. I’m not here to argue, I’m just giving my own interpretation. I totally respect your opinion and think it is just as valid as mine. This is what movies are for: interpreting. 

SO, the continuation of my post will be based on my own thoughts and if you share them, feel free to read and let me know if you feel the same. If you don’t share them, still comment, just don’t expect me to argue about this, my views are probably not going to change. 

So where was I? I never ever thought in a million years Rey was going to turn, and that was the key. This is why: the conclusion of episode 6 COULDN’T be the conclusion of the Skywalker saga BECAUSE Luke was the one who carried the burden of restoring the Jedi order. Those skywalker boys are too vulnerable to the dark side, and I even thought that before the sequels came out.

Don’t get me wrong: Luke Skywalker was and still is my hero, even in the sequels. But those skywalker boys were doomed from the beginning in my mind. I just think dark side runs too strong in their family to hold such great responsibilities. And for me, that reality is what makes Luke so amazing. Despite all of the negative factors, he still was able to resist the dark side time after time. The events of what happened with Ben were just so unfortunate and untimely that Luke’s failure was already complete even though he didn’t fully give in to his darkness. However, the more content that has recently come out about the remnants of the empire whether it be in Battlefront 2 or The Mandalorian, I realize that Luke was never supposed to carry the burden of restoring the Jedi order, he was only supposed to restore balance. Which he did, when he helped redeem Anakin.

This is where Rey comes into play. Unlike Luke, she rarely faces the dark side and the few times she has, she’s handled it pretty perfectly. She maintained her good character and didn’t even let the dark side in far enough to need to resist it, unlike Luke. And that’s saying a lot for someone related to Emperor Palpatine for Christ’s sake. 

At the end of 9, we see a different kind of defeat for the “empire” or First Order. Yeah, I’m sure there are still baddies out there, but it’s a different feeling from episode 6 knowing what we know now. There’s no more contingency plans for Palpatine, most of the First Order officers don’t have anyone to be loyal to anymore, and the Resistance has finally grown to a Republic. Ep 6 ending was more like freeing the slaves whereas Ep 9 was more like arresting the slave owners if that makes sense. The galaxy is in a better spot in Ep 9 compared to Ep 6. 

Which brings us to the same task that Luke had and was doomed to fail at. But this time the task is given to Rey Skywalker. She carries on the Skywalker name because of what it represents: good, Jedi, hope. But Rey’s blood, Rey’s heart is different. It’s nearly perfect and pure. She is the most suitable candidate to rebuild the Jedi since Yoda. After taking in every piece of Star Wars content, I see the end of Ep 9 and now say, “yeah, things are going to be alright this time, Rey’s got this, she’s the best of us.” She’s what the Jedi needed after being vulnerable for so long. In life, we often have to decide between wants and needs. While many WANTED Luke to be the one to rebuild the order, the order really NEEDED Rey to do it. And when I think about that, I appreciate the sequels so much more and forget about the small issues I have with them.",Rey Skywalker is such an essential piece to the Star Wars puzzle,this post is

1,"I know Star Wars was always meant to be movies in George's eyes. George is a film maker. That's where he saw his creation. I respect and appreciate George for giving us Star Wars. I'm not here to bash George.

That said.

I think the problem with the prequels is they fail as movies.

I watched the prequels recently trying to focus on just the story and character elements, and I think the core of that trilogy is fantastic. And it makes me wonder if someone other than George were directing those movies, maybe those stories could have been told better for film.

And I think the argument that ""he made them for kids"" is crap. No kid fondly remembers that time the senate gather for a trade negotiation. Or whatever. They remember the action and lightsaber fights.

But, if Episodes 1, 2, and 3 existed only as novels and had more room to fit in story and to let things breathe more, I think the story of the rise of Darth Vader could be one of, if not the, greatest Star Wars epics ever.

And before someone says how one of the novelizations were bad (I haven't read them) those are based on the screenplay which is written for the screen.","I think if the Episodes 1, 2, and 3 were just novels and not movies they would be better received.",i know star wars was always meant to be movies in george s eyes  george is a film maker  that s where he saw his creation  i respect and appreciate george for giving us star wars  i m not here to bash george that said i think the problem with the prequels is they fail as movies i watched the prequels recently trying to focus on just the story and character elements  and i think the core of that trilogy is fantastic  and it makes me wonder if someone other than george were directing those movies  maybe those stories could have been told better for film and i think the argument that  he made them for kids  is crap  no kid fondly remembers that time the senate gather for a trade negotiation  or whatever  they remember the action and lightsaber fights but  if episodes 1  2  and 3 existed only as novels and had more room to fit in story and to let things breathe more  i think the story of the rise of darth vader could be one of  if not the  greatest star wars epics ever and before someone says how one of the novelizations were bad  i haven t read them  those are based on the screenplay which is written for the screen i think if the episodes 1  2  and 3 were just novels and not movies they would be better received

1,"Look, I get it people hate the sequels. I really don’t like them either and have the least desire to rewatch them out of all three of the trilogies. But this narrative that the prequels were these flawless legendary movies and that Anakin is a phenomenally written character is stupid. 

The first two prequel movies are just straight up bad. I enjoyed a lot of elements of them, as I did with the sequels, but they are deeply flawed.  Like the fact that 75 percent of the dialogue from these movies is borderline cringeworthy and that anakin’s character is kinda insufferable. Anakin in general in these movies is kind of not great. His arc is phenomenal but his character is just not very convincing and comes off as whiny and annoying.  The reason he’s so likable in the clone wars is because his character is so multidimensional and the Audience can really connect with him and understand his pain and his fall to the dark side. 

In conclusion, stop treating the sequels like some cinematic masterpiece just because you don’t like the new movies.

The thankless and exploited survivors of the Clone Wars were heroic in battle, but their unparalleled bravery wasn't enough to save them from their ultimate, unfortunate fate. They were the ultimate warriors: brave, courageous, and heroic on the battlefield. But though their origin was a single man's DNA, that fact could not and did not prevent them from becoming individuals. From the Battle of Geonosis to the Siege of Mandalore and Battle of Coruscant, they fought side by side with the Jedi, the elite warriors of the Republic. Until the day came when the secret was unveiled and within seconds, they were cruelly robbed of their individuality, turning the galaxy into a sea of despair and turmoil as the once loyal warriors of the Republic were forced to turn against their own.",The Clones: Warriors of the Republic,the thankless and exploited survivors of the clone wars were heroic in battle  but their unparalleled bravery wasn t enough to save them from their ultimate  unfortunate fate  they were the ultimate warriors  brave  courageous  and heroic on the battlefield  but though their origin was a single man s dna  that fact could not and did not prevent them from becoming individuals  from the battle of geonosis to the siege of mandalore and battle of coruscant  they fought side by side with the jedi  the elite warriors of the republic  until the day came when the secret was unveiled and within seconds  they were cruelly robbed of their individuality  turning the galaxy into a sea of despair and turmoil as the once loyal warriors of the republic were forced to turn against their own the clones  warriors of the republic
1,"I had thought of this idea after seeing the Disney Gallery behind the scenes of the show.

If you forget all about the sequel trilogy, and think of The Mandalorian as the only sequels after the original trilogy, you begin to prefer that as a truth.

They have and embody the spirit of new technology while being timeless, great direction, effects, continuation and introduction of characters, and most importantly a great story (smh sequels). These are people who truly get Star Wars and respect George Lucas’ creation rather than ignoring his contribution.

The actual sequels are a forced directionless story that exist for the sake of existing. I do believe that the main Star Wars story should’ve stayed as the rise, fall, and redemption of Anakin Skywalker.

1,"So, I just decided to start watching the movie again and I've seen it so many times.

It's only just occurred to me now, that Obi-Wan suddenly breaking through that glass is a bit wild.

That glass has to be pretty decent to be so high up in the air and it's a pretty rich building to house a senator. Especially one such as Padme.

There is no way Obi-Wan could have broken through that glass, because no normal human can. Especially by leaping fingers first into the glass. He wasn't even moving that fast and lacks the strength, weight and mass to break the glass. I've linked a screenshot of the event in question:

**Link:** https://ibb.co/v1gh0Jy

**Conclusion:** He used the force? But what force power allows you to do this? Force speed? Well, the movie made no indication of that and they normally make it pretty obvious when someone's using the force.

Or is this simply an oversight and why didn't Obi-Wan simply just use the force to pull the bot through the glass towards him?

1,"Think about it.

Star Wars: 
You have the light and the dark side of the force which gives one incredible powers including incredible fighting powers.  The hero finds a mentor after encountering a broken instrument.  The mentor teaches him/her about the force.  There is a light side of the force about forgiveness and balance, and a dark side which is about destruction and power.  A villain from the dark side tries to kill and, or convert the hero.  Spaceships.

Cobra Kai 
You have martial arts philosophies which, when followed gives one incredible fighting powers.    The hero finds a mentor after encountering a broken instrument.  The mentor teaches him her about Karate.  Karate has a light side, which is about forgiveness and balance, and a dark side, which is about destruction and power.  A villain from the dark side tries to destroy and then convert the hero.  No spaceships.

So yeah, very similar shows, but what's really, Really similar is their discussion about Mr. Myagi's style of martial arts versus Kreese's style of martial arts.  When Mr. Myagi and later Daniel Larusso talk about balance, and good coming back to you, having patience, and what actually following the philosophies of martial arts means, I almost always think about the force and how its basically a MUCH better description of what the light side of the force is about and trying to achieve.  Conversely, Kreese's, the world is a hard place, a lot of people can't have what they want, and you need to be the strongest if you want to get what you want because, again, the world is a terrible place that will eat you up if you show it mercy.. that there is no good or bad only weak and strong, and believing in good or bad is its own type of weakness... I think, this is definitely the dark side of the force and what they mean... because nobody thinks they are wrong.

Except, in Star Wars, they don't go into a lot of details about the force, and don't show good coming back to you, or how the dark side thinks its really about weak or strong.  Honestly, aside from Anikan wanting to save Padme, I feel like a lot of people aren't given much motivation or explanation about struggling with one or the other side, or what it really means on a larger scale if they do.. The stakes just don't feel as high even though worlds are actually hanging in the balance.. because, it doesn't feel personal anymore, it feels like an obligation, like ""congrats you are a force user, now you must train your whole life to be super extraordinarily good, or you will ""fall"" to the dark side and become a terrible monster"".   

I just... can't understand, from watching Star Wars Saga films alone, what the general point of the sides are, but when I watch Cobra Kai, I more than get it, and I find myself using Cobra Kai and the Karate Kid to explain what I consider to be a lack of world building in Star Wars as far as the force is concerned.

Secondly, Characters:
I have to talk about the way the sequels treated the characters from each show.  This has already been pointed out by people in separate articles about each show, but never compared together.  Here's the deal, Cobra Kai is just doing much MUCH better with the character development and arcs in its sequels than Star Wars has done in its prequals and sequels.

Cobra Kai - each character ends up in a natural place based on traits they exhibited during the first series of movies.  Daniel sells cars, because he loved cars as a teenager and that was a big part of his character.  His adult self brought up that he had once tried to sell bonsai trees and failed, which is extremely consistent and well thought out.  He's married, he's got kids, and he's a main character in the sequels although no longer the main star, the show feels like most of them are all stars, like its truly an ensemble cast where everybody matters and share a good amount of screen time.  The seasons shift to put more or less emphasis on characters to allow the story to unfold at a realistic and natural rate.  The new characters are normal, not overpowered, but must be mentored by the older characters to succeed.  Similar to star wars, except all the older characters weren't murdered and sidelined and given no motivation other than the next generation, aka Daniel and Johnny have their own lives and their own goals outside of the ""force"", unlike the people in Star Wars who's everything all the time is only the ""force"".  All the old characters have to grow and arc just like the new characters do, and nobody is carrying the weight of the show.  No one is under utilized.  You can tell they weren't thinking about what they could sell, but what they wanted to tell.

In Star Wars, the original characters were ... odd, like Han being the exact character he began the series as and Luke hating the force, and all the main characters were mostly sidelines with zero character arcs, except for Luke who regained faith in the force for reasons I don't really understand, then all the main characters died.  It's just.. weird and sad to my mind, like none of them could make it out of the sequel? I thought it was a kids movie, but actually looking at it, it's quite dark.  Then there are the new generation characters who ... well Finn like wasn't given anything to do in the third movie at all, his romantic stuff was a mess, obvi., and there was little to no conflict about his transition from being a storm trooper to someone else, except for his clear motivation to run away... Rey was just perfect at everything for some reason and had literally no problems of any kind except losing her parents (which does suck but most people can't fight, fix stuff, use the force, fly, and u know save the world - and the only bad thing that ever happened to them was the loss of their parents...) just saying.... and Po - he's totally fine except it doesn't make any sense to make someone in their twenties who's had multiple failures do to ignoring the chain of command.. a general... or maybe the comander of the resistance, since it was so small by then... Lando makes more sense...  It's just like... they threw a bunch of people in because they thought people wanted to see younger people and then didn't know what to do with them.  Cobra Kai didn't include characters it didn't know what to do with.  They also understand that characters can just leave and then be available to come back again if you wanted that... just saying.

Plot:  Cobra Kai is about warring dojos, but really about how people are influencing the next generations of youths and how and why and how much Daniel and Johnny feel a responsibility to contribute to their growth and protect them from harm.  There's actually a lot of layer and depth to it, a lot of self reflection and failing and then getting back up again and failing again and getting back up yet again, and the actual internal struggles of that.  They are not perfect, but they are doing a better job than Star Wars, no offense. 

I'm not trying to be mean, I want Lucas Films to watch Cobra Kai and learn from them.  Please don't everybody get too mad about this post.","Don't get mad, but Cobra Kai is doing Star Wars better than Star Wars...",think about it star wars  you have the light and the dark side of the force which gives one incredible powers including incredible fighting powers   the hero finds a mentor after encountering a broken instrument   the mentor teaches him her about the force   there is a light side of the force about forgiveness and balance  and a dark side which is about destruction and power   a villain from the dark side tries to kill and  or convert the hero   spaceships cobra kai

karate   karate has a light side  which is about forgiveness and balance  and a dark side  which is about destruction and power   a villain from the dark side tries to destroy and then convert the

1,"So i rewatched the mandalorian again and i've come to some thematically interesting conclusions: the show has a lot of qualities for sure, but the recurring theme of Djarin and other Mandalorians not showing their face and not removing their helmet is present since the beginning. Now why is this relevant for the future? Because troughout the show we sometimes see Din giving up on his creed, on his way if it's really really necessary and more important for what he cares about: we see it bot in episodes 15 and 16, under different circumstances, once in presence of enemies and once in presence of allies, because ha has (at least partially) given up on his creed, on his tradition. Episode 3 shows this as well with Bo Katan talking about him being part of a fanatic group (but without too much judgment). This showed Din that there is another way that can be followed and he fully embraces it at its most desperate point. Mayfield explains this clearly and i think that episode 15, more than 16 really sets up a theme for the future of the series and that is being able to give up something for a greater purpose. Din embraces it and he even does so in a less necessary situation, with Grogu, because he cared more about him than about his past and his tradition. This said i don't believe that Djarin has casted aside his way, but he has accepted a compromise.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is all a premise for the point i want to make: we know that Bo Katan has to win the Darksaber, she has to take it or else she can't rule Mandalore that way. But is it really necessary? I mean we are not in Harry Potter, where the wand chooses the mage and is inherited in a fight, not obeying to its user properly if it isn't its owner. The darksaber is a tool, especially in the hands of non force-sensitive users, just that... a tool and a symbol, as the helmet is for the fanatics like Din.

Now Bo Katan doesn't follow Din's way, she is not a fanatic, but she is anyway, because the Darksaber is, under certain aspect, the same thing. It is a tradition, and it works as such because many believe in it and respect it, as probably many did with ""The Way"", but if it wasn't like this then it would've been labelled as a fanatic thing. She explained Djarin about the old way, but she is herself following an ""old way"", just a different one and she may be brought to the realization of this.

So the point is: the next step for the Mandalorian could be about Bo Katan accepting the darksaber without necessarily taking it. After all alive on the ship there were only she, Reeves, Din, Luke (that didn't see the thing), Grogu, Fennec, Cara and Gideon. Now we may assume Fennec told Boba and that can become interesting later, but except for Gideon (that i mean, may get killed or imprisoned, and also that could be interesting) the others are allies to Bo Katan and would probably shut up about the saber, except maybe Reeves and that could be a first surce of conflict:

first the conflict with Bo Katan, then the conflict with Reeves, and later maybe with other Mandalorians if they discover the truth (maye Gideon talks, or Boba does, or someone sees records of the ship).

i also think that Djarin as wel will have to face his own demons about his creed, religion, tradition and this may become another plot point, one that could open up the eyes to Bo Katan or someone else..

this is just speculation, but i think it is thematically fitting, so i wanted to share.","About the Mandalorian, Creed, traditions and the Darksaber",so i rewatched the mandalorian again and i ve come to some thematically interesting conclusions  the show has a lot of qualities for sure  but the recurring theme of djarin and other mandalorians not showing their face and not removing their helmet is present since the beginning  now why is this relevant for the future  because troughout the show we sometimes see din giving up on his creed  on his way if it s really really necessary and more important for what he cares about  we see it bot in episodes 15 and 16  under different circumstances  once in presence of enemies and once in presence of allies  because ha has  at least partially  given up on his creed  on his tradition  episode 3 shows this as well with bo katan talking about him being part of a fanatic group  but without too much judgment   this showed din that there is another way that can be followed and he fully embraces it at its most desperate point  mayfield explains this clearly and i think that episode 15  more than 16 really sets up a theme for the future of the series and that is being able to give up something for a greater purpose  din embraces it and he even does so in a less necessary situation  with grogu  because he cared more about him than about his past and his tradition  this said i don t believe that djarin has casted aside his way  but he has accepted a compromise  amp  x200b now this is all a premise for the point i want to make  we know that bo katan has to win the darksaber  she has to take it or else she can t rule mandalore that way  but is it really necessary  i mean we are not in harry potter  where the wand chooses the mage and is inherited in a fight  not obeying to its user properly if it isn t its owner  the darksaber is a tool  especially in the hands of non force sensitive users  just that    a tool and a symbol  as the helmet is for the fanatics like din now bo katan doesn t follow din s way  she is not a fanatic  but she is anyway  because the darksaber is  under certain aspect  the same thing  it is a tradition  and it works as such because many believe in it and respect it  as probably many did with  the way   but if it wasn t like this then it would ve been labelled as a fanatic thing  she explained djarin about the old way  but she is herself following an  old way   just a different one and she may be brought to the realization of this so the point is  the next step for the mandalorian could be about bo katan accepting the darksaber without necessarily taking it  after all alive on the ship there were only she  reeves  din  luke  that didn t see the thing   grogu  fennec  cara and gideon  now we may assume fennec told boba and that can become interesting later  but except for gideon  that i mean  may get killed or imprisoned  and also that could be interesting  the others are allies to bo katan and would probably shut up about the saber  except maybe reeves and that could be a first surce of conflict first the conflict with bo katan  then the conflict with reeves  and later maybe with other mandalorians if they discover the truth  maye gideon talks  or boba does  or someone sees records of the ship  i also think that djarin as wel will have to face his own demons about his creed  religion  tradition and this may become another plot point  one that could open up the eyes to bo katan or someone else   amp  x200b this is just speculation  but i think it is thematically fitting  so i wanted to share about the mandalorian  creed  traditions and the darksaber

1,"I've heard it often said that ancient Sith that ancient Sith were a lot more powerful than the Sith we saw during the Star Wars movies and even those who existed up to a thousand years before the movies.  Noteworthy powerful ancient Siths include Darth Nihlus, Darth Revan, Exar Kun, Vitiate and now some guy named Tulek Hord who supposedly never lost a duel but lived but never fought a Jedi.  

It seems like the ancient Sith were almost more like evil sorcerers than people who were badass with the force or badass lightsaber duelists.  If you had to pick the most powerful ancient Sith I would have to go with Vitiate just because he lived so long and then was even reborn once but he also performed some witchy ritual where he drained the power of thousands of Sith Lords.  To me someone like Sidious or even Darth Vader who internally harnessed their own darkside force powers is far more impressive than someone who got their powers from a ritual.  I would even go so far to say that spells and rituals seem like cheating  Ancient Sith were bigtime into amulets and spells.  I know Sidous did some of this but if seemed like he and his mentor Darth Pleagius were more into science than sorcery.  

I will admit that Revan was probably the coolest Jedi or Sith but that is just my opinion, one thing he got right was not to embrace just the dark or light side of the force.

1,"Firstly,

I am aware it is no longer canon. That said, it's part of my headcanon.

Secondly, 

My own thoughts. I'm reading/listening to it for a second time. The telling of it on audible is absolutely incredible, but what an interesting character and origin to Darth Sideous.

I absolutely love how fleshed out he is knowing how the story ends. It truly makes him kor tragic. Hego Demask is such an articulate and practical character, and so sure of himself that you almost want him to succeed. We spend so much time with this character who is truly so powerful and so wise, and has such a economical and political understanding of the galaxy. He isn't ruthless, he is just a sociopath who does what's necessary. 

What I adore most about this book is that he, at times, demonstrates the ability to care. He's genuinely fond of Palpatine. The build up to his death must have come as such a shock. We see flashes of the master manipulator/OP force user in Palpatine's, but he primarily plays the unassuming student so well. The story is told from Plagueis' perspective, and it really feels like we are inside the mind of someone so intelligent. So powerful, so wise. So confident. So successful. A genuine master. With a genuine apprentice. 

An apprentice who was NEVER an apprentice in mind. We know who the most powerful Sith Lord ever is. We know who rules the galaxy. It's not Plagueis. So for Palpatine to finally strike, it's almost heartbreaking for Plagueis, and truly tragic.

We spend all this time with this incredibly powerful, knowledgeable being. So savy. So sure of himself. Truly a puppet master. We are so sure of his plan. We are so sure of what he is sure of. He is rarely deceived. But when Palpatine reveals that Plagueis was just a pawn in his game.. and we REALLY see the evil in Palpatine for the first time, it's as if Plagueis is FINALLY meeting the monster he trained. A monster who fooled him for 30 years. A monster who was growing more powerful than him. A monster who never had any intent of keeping Plagueis around.


And he had no idea. It's tragic. I genuinely feel so sorry for him.","I would like to share my thoughts on the Darth Plagueis novel, and open up some discussion if possible.

- Obi-Wan says in Return that he discovered and took it upon himself to train Anakin. No mention of a Qui-Gonn
- Also, Obi-Wan clearly hates Anakin and aside from 1 minute in Revenge, they are not ""good friends""
- There is no reason for the Empire to shut down the battle droids except that they do not appear in the OT
- Nowhere in the OT is anything about a ""prophecy"" about a ""chosen one"" mentioned (prophecies are probably the worst storytelling device ever BTW)
- Leia in Return mentions her real mother and remembers her a bit, but that's not possible if you watch Revenge
- Han Solo and Imperial Officers doubt the existence of the Force, but the Jedi in the prequels were virtually celebrities. EVERYONE knew about them
- The technology is clearly different and more advanced in the prequels
- Boba/Jango Fett have Kiwi accents; Boba Fett in Empire has a totally different voice
- Jango Fett is not a Bounty Hunter in Clones, but an assassin. Also, Stormtroopers are clearly not clones of that assassin
- Palpatine uses a lightsaber in Revenge but he doesn't like the ""Jedi weapon"" in Return
- Obi-Wan never served Bail Organa in the clone wars
- Owen Lars and Obi-Wan have no relationship in the prequels. In addition, Owen and Anakin never showed any disagreement in the prequels. I don't even think they met.
- Anakin was never shown as a “good man” in the PT
- R2D2's boost rockets. Nuff said
- If there are only supposed to be 2 Sith at a time how come Vader says Luke would be a “powerful ally” to the Emperor?

i was arguing with my parents the other day, and i think it started because i was watching the making of mandalorian season 2 on disney +.

1,"The following is my thought process of how such a massive underworld organization collapsed. 

Maul has the cameo in Solo where we see him as the leader of Crimson dawn, 8 years later in Rebels, we see that Maul is no longer in charge of Crimson Dawn. At some point between 10 BBY and 2 BBY, Maul was dethroned as the galaxy's largest crime boss.

My guess is that Palpatine wanted Maul to be taken out of power because of his skill with the force and his vendetta against his former master. Did the Empire fund some kind of mutiny against Maul that resulted in the end of Crimson Dawn and its remnants being taken over by Jabba?

If so, Boba Fett is now the head of the criminal organization by killing Bib Fortuna.

1. After the Battle of Naboo lots of planets choose to build up armies to defend themselves so if the Trade Federation ever attacks them they'll be ready for it.
2. After the Battle of Naboo, senators believe the Republic needs to be ready for other threats like the Trade Federation and push for militarisation. So the Republic expands the Judicial Forces, increasing its budget and starting a major recruitment drive.

For both of these ideas I'll assume that Sifo Dyas still commissions the clone army and Dooku still plays a part in his death and the creation of the clone army.

So how do you think the Separatist crisis will be affected?

1,"So I was rewatching that scene in ROTS when Anakin goes to Mustafar to kill all the Separatists and I noticed something strange. 
None of the separatists recognise him as the legendary Jedi, Anakin Skywalker!! And I was like okay maybe they don’t really have photos of him spread throughout the galaxy, it is a big place after all. But then I was thinking about if any of the separatist leaders have met Anakin before, and then I realised...
POGGLE THE LESSER KNOWS ANAKIN
In an episode of the Clone Wars, Anakin interrogates Poggle and fricken force chokes him. I think Poggle would remember the face of the Jedi who almost killed him. 
So, why is it that when Nute Gunray is like “oh hey Lord Vader!” Poggle wasn’t like “guys I know him he’s a Jedi he almost killed me one time everybody shoot him now!!!!”
Please someone explain this to me. 
Do the Separatist leaders know that Darth Sidious has been grooming Anakin? I always got the impression that they just saw Sidious as a mysterious advisor/mentor figure and didn’t know much about him. 
Do Geonosians just have a really bad time recognising human faces?
Is there some book or comic where Poggle loses his memory and so no longer knows who Anakin Skywalker is?
Please somebody make like a 10 minute long YouTube video clearing this up.
I need answers!

In my own little head-canon I like to think that Poggle did realise that it was Anakin and was like “wtf guys that’s not a Sith it’s a fricken Jedi!!!”, but like none of the other separatists can understand Geonosian so Poggle is there just chirping and clicking hysterically and the other separatists are like “shut up Poggle you’re going to embarrass us in front of the new Sith Lord!!😡😡”",Weird Poggle the Lesser inconsistency in ROTS,so i was rewatching that scene in rots when anakin goes to mustafar to kill all the separatists and i noticed something strange  none of the separatists recognise him as the legendary jedi  anakin skywalker   and i was like okay maybe they don t really have photos of him spread throughout the galaxy  it is a big place after all  but then i was thinking about if any of the separatist leaders have met anakin before  and then i realised   poggle the lesser knows anakinin an episode of the clone wars  anakin interrogates poggle and fricken force chokes him  i think poggle would remember the face of the jedi who almost killed him  so  why is it that when nute gunray is like  oh hey lord vader   poggle wasn t like  guys i know him he s a jedi he almost killed me one time everybody shoot him now     please someone explain this to me  do the separatist leaders know that darth sidious has been grooming anakin  i always got the impression that they just saw sidious as a mysterious advisor mentor figure and didn t know much about him  do geonosians just have a really bad time recognising human faces is there some book or comic where poggle loses his memory and so no longer knows who anakin skywalker is please somebody make like a 10 minute long youtube video clearing this up i need answers in my own little head canon i like to think that poggle did realise that it was anakin and was like  wtf guys that s not a sith it s a fricken jedi      but like none of the other separatists can understand geonosian so poggle is there just chirping and clicking hysterically and the other separatists are like  shut up poggle you re going to embarrass us in front of the new sith lord     weird poggle the lesser inconsistency in rots

Han would shoot first and Greedo wouldn’t say “Maclunkey”. I’d cut the Jabba scene from this film. All scenes involving CGI can stay if the CGI is fixed up and made better, except for that lizard in Mos Eisley that blocks the screen, that’s needs to be edited out. 

I wouldn’t change much for Empire except making the CGI better. As for deleted scenes the Wampa attack on the Rebel’s base could maybe be put back in if we use some CGI over the Wampa costumes because those suits are awful.

I wouldn’t change much in return of the Jedi until we got to the end, for the celebration scene I would use the Yub Nub song but keep the special edition shots of Besbin, Naboo, Coruscant and Tatooine. But I’d also add a shot on Kashyyyk. I’d use Sebastian Shaw as Anakin because it makes more sense based on what we know about force ghosts. 

That’s all I would do.",How I would make a special editions.,if i somehow got to make my own special editions of the original trilogy here s how i would make them first for a new hope  if you go onto disney  and click the bonus tab on a new hope you ll see several deleted scenes  i see little to no harm in adding some of those into the main film  han would shoot first and greedo wouldn t say  maclunkey   i d cut the jabba scene from this film  all scenes involving cgi can stay if the cgi is fixed up and made better  except for that lizard in mos eisley that blocks the screen  that s needs to be edited out  i wouldn t change much for empire except making the cgi better  as for deleted scenes the wampa attack on the rebel s base could maybe be put back in if we use some cgi over the wampa costumes because those suits are awful i wouldn t change much in return of the jedi until we got to the end  for the celebration scene i would use the yub nub song but keep the special edition shots of besbin  naboo  coruscant and tatooine  but i d also add a shot on kashyyyk  i d use sebastian shaw as anakin because it makes more sense based on what we know about force ghosts  that s all i would do how i would make a special editions

1,"Just a fun discussion to create your own character thats either standalone or ties into existing Star Wars stories:

I’ll go first:

Fletcher Tannon, a Mandalorian, was born 22 BBY as a Mandalorian. Not long after his birth, Death Watch attacked their clan’s town and Bo-Katan killed his father. It was related to his father’s Mandalorian creed, but he never discussed it. He joined the Empire late, around the age of 23. He rose through the ranks at the Academy quickly and was sent to Scarrif to become a Death Trooper. Death Trooper DT-271, or Fletcher Tannon, finished his training with his squadron and entered his first mission, protecting a commander at the Battle of Endor. The battle seems to go well, until it doesn’t. His commander is killed, the higher ranking officers are gone, and the squadron is captured by the Rebellion. Being their first assignment after the heavy training on Scarrif, they didn’t know anything useful, but (having little true loyalty to the Empire) they revealed everything they knew. Mostly info regarding Death Trooper training, and some bits of info regarding the Empire’s intentions after the Battle of Endor (if they succeeded). The Rebellion still places them in custody for a shortened sentence of 3 years, since they were Imperial though not guilty of much else. In prison, the squadron’s hatred for the Empire grew, Fletcher especially hating their treatment of Mandalorians, his people). After being freed, the squadron meets on Naboo to figure out what they’re going to do. Fletcher decides to return home to his mother’s Mandalorian Clan, one of the squadron decides to become a bounty hunter (its what he does best, and has no other allies or skills), one joins the New Republic, and the last one joins Fletcher to go to his home (having no family himself). When Fletcher returns to his mother, he learns how much the Tannon clan has changed since he was a child. They allied closely with Moff Gideon and his claim to Mandalore, and have changed their colors to Gideon’s Black and White (Though he accepts his father’s armor as it was, unchanged and unworn since his death). And not only that, his clan won’t accept his longtime friend as a foundling. He learns of Bo’s return and the claim of Din, a foundling, and his hatred for her burns as the clan rejects her claim, since she didn’t accept it by combat, and Gideon won it by tradition. Though, he is intrigued by Din’s arrival, as an unknown character to the clans.

Basically, a character that shows Bo’s past, and the effect Gideon had among the Mandalorians.

1,"I won't bore you with my love of this movie. It's my favorite. I have my reasons. You have your reasons why you might NOT like it, but I'd love to talk about my writing partner's ideas that would've improved the film and probably also decreased backlash. 

1. First and foremost, don't make Poe and Holdo enemies; make them unwilling partners who both share a love of Leia. Poe takes after Leia's rebellious side. Holdo takes after her strategic side. In this version, Holdo is on board with the Finn &amp; Rose mission but has her doubts. She and Poe argue about retreat vs. fighting back and how they can keep everyone together. Poe still learns his lesson that it's not about being a hero and taking out bad guys. It's about saving lives. 

2. Instead of fathier racing, it's the children being forced to Pod-Race. Get a little nostalgia in there. It changes nothing from the story and a Pod-Racing chase scene would've been awesome! They still get to destroy the casino by flying through it and destroy shady supplies in the process. 

3. Extend Luke's flashback. Don't have him immediately buried under rubble. Have him caught off guard enough where the attack on his temple is still a success but also show him being a badass that was expected of so many people. He wields his green lightsaber.

1,"You got this simple farm boy from Sand World. He has two loving parents. They're not his mom and dad but they love him as a son. 

Then one day things get a little out of his hand with his new robot toys and when he gets home, his parents... the man and woman who raised him, the folks that are bit hard on him but still understand him enough... well they're just VAPORIZED aren't they? They're not stabbed. They're not shot. They are fucking SKELETONS! And Luke is just... well it appears to suck a little for him; definitely gonna put a damper on his day. It's at least gonna make the next hour kinda shitty. 

But then this old guy, Ben, who he's known for all of about thirteen hours is struck down by another random stranger and Luke just about loses his shit. Death to space Nazis! Death to Robot Men with Red Laser swords! Death to anyone who insulted this old man who could do magic tricks! It's depression time... his magician buddy is gone; shit, he might not even actually be dead. There wasn't a body and Luke is pretty confident he heard him tell him to run away... but he ain't actually here with Luke so he might as well let this hot girl who only lost her entire fucking planet comfort him.

Skip ahead a bit and Luke goes to avenge his surrogate grandpa who he knew in real life for less than a day and still may or may not be around... it's kinda unclear to Luke, as he was either hallucinating on the brink of an icy death or had been chilling with a talking frog the past few days so it made sense. 

Anyways, he confronts the murderous Robot Human who is also Space Hitler... but also his DADDY! That's right! Space Hitler killed Luke's friend, but now he's also ready to be a part of his life and have a real relationship, provided a lil' genocide is on the table every now and then. Luke says no but then mulls it over a bit and like... maybe? If he can convince his deadbeat dad to STOP committing genocide and in fact fight AGAINST the genocide... maybe they can do that game of catch every once in a while and enjoy the benefits of traditional family values. 

TL;DR: Luke doesn't give a fuck about the people who raised him as their own from birth, but a few hours is all he needs to grow permanently attached to a religious hermit and literally space Hitler who killed the religious hermit.

Obviously, this post is tongue and cheek. I'm just saying that Star Wars has _always_ been inconsistent and silly with its characters and that's okay.

1,"In the Mandalorian we get to see the legend himself: Luke Skywalker. He is a fully realized Jedi, and he is now the most famous man in the galaxy. Luke is now spending his days traveling the galaxy, looking for force sensitive beings to induct into the new Jedi Order. This is his chance to save the Jedi once and for all. 

And this is where everything falls apart. 

In TLJ, we learn that Luke sensed the Dark Side in Ben and acted on impulse, trying to kill Ben so that he couldn't destroy what Luke had worked to build with his blood, sweat, and tears. At first, like a majority of others, I couldn't believe my eyes. Luke Skywalker would never do that! How could Luke do such a thing, this isn't Luke!

And then I saw Luke in the Mandalorian, and all the puzzle pieces came together. Picture this: you're Luke Skywalker, you have defeated your father and the Empire is practically no more. *All eyes* in the galaxy are now on you. You are the legendary Luke Skywalker, you are the paragon of good, you can do no wrong. And you accept this, you allow the legend to permeate and spread because, what? Are you going to tell these people not to look up to you? You who, in their eyes, single handedly took down the two most feared men in the galaxy? So instead, you allow this to happen while devoting yourself to rebuilding the Jedi Order. Remember, at this time, you believe that you are the **only** chance the Jedi have left. So, you do what is expected of you. You go around the galaxy, you recruit students, and you do your best to teach them the ways of the Jedi of old. After a decade, perhaps more, of doing this, it happens. You sense something, something you haven't felt in what feels like a millennia. You brush it off, thinking that one of your students is frustrated, or having a bad day. Then it comes back, and then again, and again. You keep getting these pangs of Dark, and you know where they're coming from. But it's Ben! Han and Leia's child! It's ridiculous to think that he would ever harbor such negative emotion. He's probably just prone to impulses like his father. But... as the months drag on, you cannot ignore the growing darkness in his heart. You've tried to advice him, to remind him of the Jedi ways, and he scoffs. He won't listen. One day you're patrolling the grounds and you feel it, the Dark Side. You haven't felt it so intensely since... since Vader and the Emperor. You, the Legendary Luke Skywalker, Heir to the Jedi, now has a tangible threat to your Jedi Order. Years spent trying to foster a new Jedi Order, and one of your students can spell the end of it all. Doubt creeps in, ""how could I let this happen, I'm Luke!?"" After doubt, comes fear, ""If Ben turns on us, on my students, everything will be lost. I will have failed the Jedi, failed the New Republic. The Jedi as the galaxy knows it will be destroyed forever.""

Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. 

So you do it. You resolve to destroy the roots before they can spread. You enter Ben's room, lightsaber in hand, you ignite it. You are going to save the Jedi. Your own morality no longer matters, it is the good of the Galaxy and the fate of the Jedi, for the life of one man. Then, Ben looks at you, fear in his eyes. You realize that you've gotten it all wrong. You have failed. It is you that has driven Ben to the Dark Side. Ben collapses the room before you can protest and runs away, never to return. It was you, it was the Legendary Luke Skywalker that destroyed the Jedi Order. 

As you can see. I believe that it was the Legend of Luke Skywalker and the pressure put upon him by the entire Galaxy that drew the Dark Side to manifest itself in him again, as it had when he fought Vader. The Dark Side was always there in him, it didn't disappear forever when he forgave his father. It bided its time, and prayed upon his fears and doubts as his legend grew larger. And in that one fateful moment, he fell from grace, and the rest is history. I hope that this gets expounded upon more in the future, because I think it reminds us all that Luke is still just a person. He has flaws, and he can make mistakes in the heat of the moment. Luke is not the unfillable Legend that we all believed him to be. That is why I think Luke in TLJ works so well and why The Mandalorian only reinforces that. Now, I'm not a fool, obviously 99% of y'all are gonna disagree and drag me through the mud, but it wouldn't be the first time. I just hope that you can look at Luke in a new perspective, even if you still vehemently disagree with me. After all, it is multifaceted and complex characters that make Star Wars so much more interesting than many other properties out there. I would love to hear your own takes on Luke and where he will end up. Thank you for reading. 

TLDR: The Legendary Luke Skywalker realized in the Mandalorian does not retcon TLJ Luke, but reinforces it.

1,"(* *Couldn't care less if Luke is grumpy or he dies. The sequel triology has some fun and entertaining scenes too I think*

* *Peequels aren't fantastic films, very average but they don't ruin the franchise. They weren't trying to change the cannon (which when you change basic rules set in a fantasy universe you are pretty much saying the writers don't know what to do*)

Tldr : It's the blatant laziness, cashgrab that I hate.

I know fans think that the sequel triology will soon be regarded good in star wars fans eyes. Just like the prequels. I don't see that happening. Why?

#1. LAZY WRITING

Force Awaken, Everyone Force Sensitive, Everyone Super Lucky, Random Kid levitate Rake, Rey Super Powerful, Luke Super Grumpy, Liea actually trained to be a Jedi so she can stay alive after the blast on the ship. 

This is what the new sequel triology is to me. This hurts the franchise. Throwing absolute dogshit around, doing whatever the story wants the charachters to do. They give whole explanation of Liea being more or less a Jedi in 5 seconds (*ahem* George was apparently going to put Leia incharge in his new triology, the creator of the whole Franchise wanted something else that made more sense then what Disney chose *ahem*) just for a 3 minute SUBVERSION scene. This is the trainwreck the new movies are.

Force is such a vague device used in all the movies, never explained (*ahem* which George was apparently going to in his new triology *ahem*). It's more like Force is used whenever the writer doesn't know what to do now.

I'm a new fan. They never explain what the Force is. So From what I understand from the lore present, they still never explained all of this is any of the movies yet:

Force isn't meant to be sentient is it, it's more or less like gravity, a thing that exists everywhere around us, the only thing is beings with midi-chlorians can manipulate it? So why is it awake.

Why didn't it awake before. (It created Anakin the chosen one yes, but in the new triology everyone somehow is super lucky because of the Force, a random child can levitate a rake and call it towards him now)

If it did awake why is it helping the Jedis because as far as I know, both the Sith and Jedi use the force. Dark Force and Good Force aren't two entities fighting so why is it trying to create balance in the first place. 

Who are the Skywalkers, why are they so powerful.

What happened to Palpatine's Son/Daughter. Who even married them, why did they, and what happened after a Daughter was given birth to. 

Why can Palpatine only care for Granddaughter and not his real Daughter/Son

There were always only Jedi's, no Sith's. The Force when used with anger and selflessness can give someone the power of the dark side. So why did Sith's originated in the first place. The only sense I can make of it is a Jedi wanted something only the Dark Force can achieve, so he turned evil to gain the powers and help himself. Why is it never explained

Why is Vader a moron. All he cared for once was power and being a Jedi Master and learning more. Then he turns Dark and doesn't learn the sexy Brain Transfer trick Palpatine used to stay alive in Rise of Skywalker.  Why didn't the Sith before Palpatine use it.

So much is left unexplained and what they chose to do is prequels. Which fair play, George wanted to do them for fun. He had no plans of ever making star wars seriously after the OT. They didn't ruin the logic, they just were badly made films that are liked now because they are a meme. They are hilarious and give atleast some insight. They are passionate but not lazy 

2. CLICKBAIT

""Rey is actually a Sith Robot""

What if Kathleen comes out and announces this tomorrow? Just think this for a moment.. yeah?

This is what most Star Wars fans felt while watching The Last Jedi. The problem isn't what Luke does. It's just absolutely dogshit clickbait 

CLICKBAIT ISN'T SUBVERSION

Why do you think they didn't make other movies or shows before making a Skywalker triology, and then said ""these new movies are not for people who are nostalgic""

Any way you approach it, these movies are cashgrabs. After acquiring Lucasfilms, they didn't take a second to announce Star Wars and Luke is back! When you say that, it logically means they are calling out the Star Wars fans who love the franchise.

Then you build up hype, you release a 30 sec scene of a 
beloved hero (a good scene) but you do all this for hype. 

Then on Last Jedi, poof? What is the return here from the hype you generate. It's like if Apple teases an revolutionary product, and releases a 800$ plastic stand. You will receive backlash for that.","A explanation on why I, who started watching Star Wars in 2020, still hates the sequel triology and why I think they won't be as liked as the prequels",    couldn t care less if luke is grumpy or he dies  the sequel triology has some fun and entertaining scenes too i think    peequels aren t fantastic films  very average but they don t ruin the franchise  they weren t trying to change the cannon  which when you change basic rules set in a fantasy universe you are pretty much saying the writers don t know what to do  tldr   it s the blatant laziness  cashgrab that i hate i know fans think that the sequel triology will soon be regarded good in star wars fans eyes  just like the prequels  i don t see that happening  why  1  lazy writingforce awaken  everyone force sensitive  everyone super lucky  random kid levitate rake  rey super powerful  luke super grumpy  liea actually trained to be a jedi so she can stay alive after the blast on the ship  this is what the new sequel triology is to me  this hurts the franchise  throwing absolute dogshit around  doing whatever the story wants the charachters to do  they give whole explanation of liea being more or less a jedi in 5 seconds   ahem  george was apparently going to put leia incharge in his new triology  the creator of the whole franchise wanted something else that made more sense then what disney chose  ahem   just for a 3 minute subversion scene  this is the trainwreck the new movies are force is such a vague device used in all the movies  never explained   ahem  which george was apparently going to in his new triology  ahem    it s more like force is used whenever the writer doesn t know what to do now i m a new fan  they never explain what the force is  so from what i understand from the lore present  they still never explained all of this is any of the movies yet force isn t meant to be sentient is it  it s more or less like gravity  a thing that exists everywhere around us  the only thing is beings with midi chlorians can manipulate it  so why is it awake why didn t it awake before   it created anakin the chosen one yes  but in the new triology everyone somehow is super lucky because of the force  a random child can levitate a rake and call it towards him now if it did awake why is it helping the jedis because as far as i know  both the sith and jedi use the force  dark force and good force aren t two entities fighting so why is it trying to create balance in the first place  who are the skywalkers  why are they so powerful what happened to palpatine s son daughter  who even married them  why did they  and what happened after a daughter was given birth to  why can palpatine only care for granddaughter and not his real daughter sonthere were always only jedi s  no sith s  the force when used with anger and selflessness can give someone the power of the dark side  so why did sith s originated in the first place  the only sense i can make of it is a jedi wanted something only the dark force can achieve  so he turned evil to gain the powers and help himself  why is it never explainedwhy is vader a moron  all he cared for once was power and being a jedi master and learning more  then he turns dark and doesn t learn the sexy brain transfer trick palpatine used to stay alive in rise of skywalker   why didn t the sith before palpatine use it so much is left unexplained and what they chose to do is prequels  which fair play  george wanted to do them for fun  he had no plans of ever making star wars seriously after the ot  they didn t ruin the logic  they just were badly made films that are liked now because they are a meme  they are hilarious and give atleast some insight  they are passionate but not lazy 2  clickbait rey is actually a sith robot what if kathleen comes out and announces this tomorrow  just think this for a moment   yeah this is what most star wars fans felt while watching the last jedi  the problem isn t what luke does  it s just absolutely dogshit clickbait clickbait isn t subversionwhy do you think they didn t make other movies or shows before making a skywalker triology  and then said  these new movies are not for people who are nostalgic any way you approach it  these movies are cashgrabs  after acquiring lucasfilms  they didn t take a second to announce star wars and luke is back  when you say that  it logically means they are calling out the star wars fans who love the franchise then you build up hype  you release a 30 sec scene of a beloved hero  a good scene  but you do all this for hype  then on last jedi  poof  what is the return here from the hype you generate  it s like if apple teases an revolutionary product  and releases a 800  plastic stand  you will receive backlash for that a explanation on why i  who started watching star wars in 2020  still hates the sequel triology and why i think they won t be as liked as the prequels

1,"Ok yall I have developed a spicy theory that will make Sriracha seem like it is vanilla yogurt and here it is. Plo Koon is alive and will return. This theory comes from 3 bits of info

First off we know that Plo Koon was killed in order 66 right? Wrong we know his ship was shot down but we never had a confirmation of his death. The clones shooting at him were solders he had fought alongside of for 3 years in the clone wars. Plo also was a phenomenal pilot and the lego model of his space ship has an eject button.

Second we know that Plo Koon was the Jedi who brought Ahsoka Tano into the jedi order and was her mentor for years. Were he to make a cameo it would be huge for the upcoming series.

Third Dave Filoni is a huge fan of Plo Koon and he has stated in an interview that he does not believe Plo is dead. Who is Dave Filoni you ask? The director of the Clone wars series and projected director of the Ahsoka Tano series.

Finally Plo Koon is one of the only cannon jedi who do not speak to Rey in Episode 9! Of all the voice actors who make an appearance in episode 9 plo koon's voice actor James Taylor is not one of them (I went back and listened 4 times to confirm).

To summarize this whole thing we know that Plo is a member of the Baran Do order, a force sensitive order of Kel Dor who survived order 66 due to their small size. Plo koon likely ejected from his ship, fled to his home planet and has remained with the Baran Do order until his appearance in the Ahsoka Tano series in 2022.

What are your thoughts? Let me know below.",Plo Koon is alive and will return (soon) and here is why,ok yall i have developed a spicy theory that will make sriracha seem like it is vanilla yogurt and here it is  plo koon is alive and will return  this theory comes from 3 bits of infofirst off we know that plo koon was killed in order 66 right  wrong we know his ship was shot down but we never had a confirmation of his death  the clones shooting at him were solders he had fought alongside of for 3 years in the clone wars  plo also was a phenomenal pilot and the lego model of his space ship has an eject button second we know that plo koon was the jedi who brought ahsoka tano into the jedi order and was her mentor for years  were he to make a cameo it would be huge for the upcoming series third dave filoni is a huge fan of plo koon and he has stated in an interview that he does not believe plo is dead  who is dave filoni you ask  the director of the clone wars series and projected director of the ahsoka tano series finally plo koon is one of the only cannon jedi who do not speak to rey in episode 9  of all the voice actors who make an appearance in episode 9 plo koon s voice actor james taylor is not one of them  i went back and listened 4 times to confirm  to summarize this whole thing we know that plo is a member of the baran do order  a force sensitive order of kel dor who survived order 66 due to their small size  plo koon likely ejected from his ship  fled to his home planet and has remained with the baran do order until his appearance in the ahsoka tano series in 2022 what are your thoughts  let me know below plo koon is alive and will return  soon  and here is why

1,"I am not a fan of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. I'd even go so far as to say it's my least favourite Disney Era Star Wars film. 

However, I am clearly in the minority on this, and everyone else on this Reddit hails it as one of the best or THE best film in the franchise. I've seen lots of people defend it for a multiple reasons that I personally don't agree with, but I was hoping some of you guys could shed some more light on your personal reasons for liking this film that I'm just not getting.

For argument's sake, I do have a quick run-down of my likes and dislikes on the film. I just wanted to outline the things that make it frustrating in my opinion to watch, as well as acknowledge the good that is in it, as it is not the worst movie if all time by any means:

Likes:
- The cinematography is good. Like REALLY good. Some real gorgeous shots throughout
- The space battles are well-executed from a technical standpoint.
- I actually like Cassian Andor and would like to see more of him as he was really under-used IMO (looking forward to the Disney+ series)
- The joke where the stormtroopers put a bag over Chirrut's head and he exclaims ""are you kidding me?! I AM BLIND"" legitimately made me laugh out loud
- It actually made the Empire threatening
- The CGI on Tarkin and Leia, while not quite there yet, is an impressive feat and looked better than I thought it would

Dislikes:
- The characters. Just... The characters. I had a hard time caring about any of them, and I can usually forgive a dumb plot and other flaws if I like the characters enough.
     - Saw Gerrera - I have no idea what the point of his character is and it is not acted well. We don't see any of his relationship with Jyn as her ""adopted"" father and his death is meaningless. If this character type is in your movie, it's kind of an unwritten rule that you should see a connection between them and their adoptive child.
     - Jyn Erso - I also don't care about Jyn. She has no particular skills, likes or dislikes that made me relate to her. Lots of other characters had something to bring to the team (sharpshooting, hand-to-hand combat, Imperial knowledge, etc) but she just... Is related to someone who's actually important? I also didn't buy her relationship with her dad of sudden belief in the Rebellion in Act 2. Again if we had some time anywhere in the movie to see their relationship or her view of the world I might have cared but I just... Didn't. She's also a super passive character, basically being dragged along everywhere she went and told what to do until she decides she likes the Rebellion, which again made no sense to me.
     - Bodhi Rook - not a bad character per se, but so much wasted potential, and again we know nothing about him. He defected from the Empire but... Why? Then he gets his brain scrambled and then is fine 2 minutes later? And then the movie kind of forgets he's even there? This one is more frustrating because of how much people hate on Finn for his wasted potential, when Bodhi has a pretty similar set up, but is given even less insight into why he defected and everyone seems fine with it.
     - Baze Malbus - not much to say, I just don't know much about him aside from ""he has a gun""
     - K-2SO - I didn't find him funny, and he was essentially just a one-liner machine. For how much people rag on the comedy in the Sequel Trilogy, I'm surprised he doesn't get more flack

- The first two thirds of the movie are a bit of a mess. I literally got whiplash from how many planets we went to in such a short amount of time and how many things were happening. IMO it was needlessly complicated for a plot that can be summed up with ""Rebels steal the Death Star Plans"".
- I didn't care during the fight scenes, even the Darth Vader hallway scene. Like, it was well-executed, filmed and choreographed well, I just didn't get excited about it like a lot of people did.
- The whole idea that Galen intentionally put that design flaw in the Death Star is kind of lame. Like, if you were going to put in something like that to destroy the Death Star, why make it so hard to hit, and if it's not supposed to be that hard to hit, it kind of devalues the significance of Luke's accomplishment.
- Also did not buy the emotion in Galen's message to Jyn. Just did not feel genuine to me. We never get a single moment of the two of them together to connect with their relationship, and as a result, the whole thing rang hollow for me.

If you loved this movie, I really want to hear why! All the things I mentioned are my opinion, and clearly I'm just not getting the same out of it as a lot of people are, so I'm curious about hearing some real peoples' thoughts.

1,"This is my idea for a Ki Adi Mundi biopic. Please let me know what you think and if you’d want to watch it.

First fifteen minutes quickly flashes through kis life and him having his many children and becoming a member of the Jedi council

Then skips to his defeat on the battle of hypori and stages general Grevious as the main villain. 

Ki adi mundi is crippled by defeat and turns to smoking spice which he becomes addicted to. Although he keeps his addicted hidden from the council his many baby mummies find out and revoke his rights to see his children. 

Mundi befriends an old pilot friend called Olabar and they smoke spice together and talk about their pasts. 

Mundi and olabar agree to track down general grevious so they can be sound. Without the Jedi councils knowledge they fly off to general grevious ship and board.

After a legendary lightsaber duel Ki adi mundi is defeated. Just as general grevious is to cut off mundis head the ship turns sharply and a brick knocks mundi and grevious into an elevator shaft leaving their lightsabers behind 

Mundi chucks around grevious with the force and remarks that he is “trapped down here with no freaking spice”. Grevious then opens up to Mundi that he was also once addicted to spice and they have a deep chat about their addictions and how to overcome. 

After two days in the shaft spending time with grevious causes mundi to discover his sith side. Count mundi uses his sith powers to lightning force the elevator shaft and spark it to work again. Grevious and mundi leave in peace and mundi returns. I forgot to mention olabar died during the initial battle.

Mundi goes back to the Jedi council and get his life back together but has lost touch with his children. 

The film ends during order 66 when mundi is shot down. However annakin finds him and senses his sith side and heals his gun wound using jedi powers.

Whilst assumed dead mundi escapes in ship.

The film will be followed by a dark comedy sit-com about mundi finding his children.",Ki Adi Munda biopic idea,this is my idea for a ki adi mundi biopic  please let me know what you think and if you d want to watch it first fifteen minutes quickly flashes through kis life and him having his many children and becoming a member of the jedi councilthen skips to his defeat on the battle of hypori and stages general grevious as the main villain  ki adi mundi is crippled by defeat and turns to smoking spice which he becomes addicted to  although he keeps his addicted hidden from the council his many baby mummies find out and revoke his rights to see his children  mundi befriends an old pilot friend called olabar and they smoke spice together and talk about their pasts  mundi and olabar agree to track down general grevious so they can be sound  without the jedi councils knowledge they fly off to general grevious ship and board after a legendary lightsaber duel ki adi mundi is defeated  just as general grevious is to cut off mundis head the ship turns sharply and a brick knocks mundi and grevious into an elevator shaft leaving their lightsabers behind mundi chucks around grevious with the force and remarks that he is  trapped down here with no freaking spice   grevious then opens up to mundi that he was also once addicted to spice and they have a deep chat about their addictions and how to overcome  after two days in the shaft spending time with grevious causes mundi to discover his sith side  count mundi uses his sith powers to lightning force the elevator shaft and spark it to work again  grevious and mundi leave in peace and mundi returns  i forgot to mention olabar died during the initial battle mundi goes back to the jedi council and get his life back together but has lost touch with his children  the film ends during order 66 when mundi is shot down  however annakin finds him and senses his sith side and heals his gun wound using jedi powers whilst assumed dead mundi escapes in ship the film will be followed by a dark comedy sit com about mundi finding his children ki adi munda biopic idea

1,"First off, I love pretty much all Star Wars media, including series, spinoffs and the sequels.   


Generally it seems that Revenge of the Sith gains the top spot for most folks, where A Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones compete for the bottom spot: the deciding factor being how much one dislikes Jar Jar or sand.   


The reason i favor AotC for the top spot overall is in a sense twofold: Its about what it does, and about what the other two does not.  


Phantom Menace is actually a brilliant Star Wars film: It expands daringly upon the Force, it introduces mulitple fan-favorite characters, and it sets the pace for the other two by setting up threads of political division and Jedi failure. There are plenty of real life sets and props, and the music is fabulous. It also introduces some of the coolest worlds. The reason it doesnt quite do it for me is essentially scale: wheras the meta plot about the return of the Sith and Anakins induction to the Order is fantastic, the actual plot is about a trade dispute and blockade, which means it cant quite match up to the start of the Clone Wars, or its dramatic conclusion.  


Revenge of the Sith, on the other hand, should easily be the best but it lets me down in some core areas which means I never have quite so much fun. I know that is controversial, but some primary mistakes or shortcomings can be how it wasted Padme as a character, how the magnificent opening space battle is followed by what feels like a video game level, how so much of the combat and action is centered around battledroids which are used as much for comic relief as for actual tensionbuilding, and how three out of five lightsaber duels are in my opinion subpar or directly dissapointing. Dooku VS Anakin and Obi-Wan is good enough, Obi-Wan VS Anakin is awesome, but the remaining three just dont work. The battle with Grievous is so unengaging, and given how climactic the duel between Mace and Sidious should have been it is a massive letdown. The YodaVSidious duel is fine, but I think they missed a trick given how powerful they both are, and we should have seen more large scale Force battling.   


Attack of the Clones, on the other hand, is always super fun and rewarding for me to watch. The only real drawback is some cringy scenes with Anakin and Padme, which are excusable at best. It begins with one of the best opening scenes in Star Wars, with the Naboo shuttle turning in space above Coruscant and some awesome sound design from the engine. It then goes into some fun setup with the assasination attempts and a logical starting point, that being Obi-Wan and Anakin sent to protect Padme due to their familiarity. We have some really cool exploration of the relationship between Anakin and the Jedi, Anakin and Obi-Wan, and between Anakin and Palpatine. It shows the best of what Obi-Wan and Anakin has together, but shows the shortcomings of Obi-Wan as a master to Anakin as well. We get Jango Fett as a badass villain with what in my opinion is a super interesting intrigue arch, leading not only to the revelation of Kamino as another cool world, but the introduction of the clones. All the while Anakin and Padmes relationship is furthered, and some really good groundwork is laid for Anakins eventual betrayal with the death of his mother. The two storylines are tied together with each other and the meta-plot, being the approaching war between the seperatists and the Republic. As a payoff we get the sublime arena scenes, with some kickass Jedi Action (in a time where droids are allowed to be more threatening) and the superb entry of Yoda and the clones. The film kind of wraps up with my favorite confrontation of the prequels, being the showdown with Dooku.  We get to see some awesome bladework from Dooku, and some interesting storytelling: Obi-Wan is smarter than Anakin, but Anakin has more raw talent as a duelist. Both are relatively swiftly defeated, and then we get a super tense and cool force duel between Yoda and Dooku, finally showcasing Yodas power (this is also the first time we get to see tutaminis) and i think they nailed the balance with regards to having Dooku dueling Yoda without it feeling too odd.   


Overall I always enjoy AotC, wheras RotS and PM leaves me wanting or slightly dissapointed. All are great Star Wars films, but Attack is my definite favorite.",Attack of the Clones is (by far) my favorite Prequel era film,first off  i love pretty much all star wars media  including series  spinoffs and the sequels    generally it seems that revenge of the sith gains the top spot for most folks  where a phantom menace and attack of the clones compete for the bottom spot  the deciding factor being how much one dislikes jar jar or sand    the reason i favor aotc for the top spot overall is in a sense twofold  its about what it does  and about what the other two does not   phantom menace is actually a brilliant star wars film  it expands daringly upon the force  it introduces mulitple fan favorite characters  and it sets the pace for the other two by setting up threads of political division and jedi failure  there are plenty of real life sets and props  and the music is fabulous  it also introduces some of the coolest worlds  the reason it doesnt quite do it for me is essentially scale  wheras the meta plot about the return of the sith and anakins induction to the order is fantastic  the actual plot is about a trade dispute and blockade  which means it cant quite match up to the start of the clone wars  or its dramatic conclusion   revenge of the sith  on the other hand  should easily be the best but it lets me down in some core areas which means i never have quite so much fun  i know that is controversial  but some primary mistakes or shortcomings can be how it wasted padme as a character  how the magnificent opening space battle is followed by what feels like a video game level  how so much of the combat and action is centered around battledroids which are used as much for comic relief as for actual tensionbuilding  and how three out of five lightsaber duels are in my opinion subpar or directly dissapointing  dooku vs anakin and obi wan is good enough  obi wan vs anakin is awesome  but the remaining three just dont work  the battle with grievous is so unengaging  and given how climactic the duel between mace and sidious should have been it is a massive letdown  the yodavsidious duel is fine  but i think they missed a trick given how powerful they both are  and we should have seen more large scale force battling    attack of the clones  on the other hand  is always super fun and rewarding for me to watch  the only real drawback is some cringy scenes with anakin and padme  which are excusable at best  it begins with one of the best opening scenes in star wars  with the naboo shuttle turning in space above coruscant and some awesome sound design from the engine  it then goes into some fun setup with the assasination attempts and a logical starting point  that being obi wan and anakin sent to protect padme due to their familiarity  we have some really cool exploration of the relationship between anakin and the jedi  anakin and obi wan  and between anakin and palpatine  it shows the best of what obi wan and anakin has together  but shows the shortcomings of obi wan as a master to anakin as well  we get jango fett as a badass villain with what in my opinion is a super interesting intrigue arch  leading not only to the revelation of kamino as another cool world  but the introduction of the clones  all the while anakin and padmes relationship is furthered  and some really good groundwork is laid for anakins eventual betrayal with the death of his mother  the two storylines are tied together with each other and the meta plot  being the approaching war between the seperatists and the republic  as a payoff we get the sublime arena scenes  with some kickass jedi action  in a time where droids are allowed to be more threatening  and the superb entry of yoda and the clones  the film kind of wraps up with my favorite confrontation of the prequels  being the showdown with dooku   we get to see some awesome bladework from dooku  and some interesting storytelling  obi wan is smarter than anakin  but anakin has more raw talent as a duelist  both are relatively swiftly defeated  and then we get a super tense and cool force duel between yoda and dooku  finally showcasing yodas power  this is also the first time we get to see tutaminis  and i think they nailed the balance with regards to having dooku dueling yoda without it feeling too odd    overall i always enjoy aotc  wheras rots and pm leaves me wanting or slightly dissapointed  all are great star wars films  but attack is my definite favorite attack of the clones is  by far  my favorite prequel era film

Were there back-up Y-wings just in case some got shot down before they could make their run and one just hung out while the other three did the run?

1,"All of Marvels Phase 4 and 5 movies are going to deal with some extremely out there premises. WandaVision and Loki’s trailers prove that. And are people upset over multiple timelines being setup? No not at all, it is probably looked forward to as much as any movies and shows have ever been. 

So the sequel trilogy can most definitely be undone or at least just be a really really shitty bad dream universe separate from the one we all grew up with. 

Favreau, Filoni, Feige(the brains behind all 22 mcu movies so far and a dozen to come as well as a dozen shows) George Lucas and all the directors that have helped on the mandalorian are writing and developing a story that Kathleen Kennedy can only envy over and will try to rob us of considering she robbed Us from JJs episode 8 and Trevorows episode 9 as well as GEORGE LUCASS SEQUEL TRILOGY. 

Who in there right mind has George Lucas hand them an almost complete trilogy and tell the Mastermind himself, no thanks I think I can do better. I mean omg!!! 

If you don’t think the ST is gonna be erased or at least swept under a rug to exist in some alternate reality which doesn’t affect the Star Wars fans want then you aren’t paying attention to what Disney is doing with Star Wars. 

Not 1!! I repeat not a single one of the 11 Star Wars shows announced a few weeks ago are going to be about the sequel trilogy. These shows won’t be behind us until 2025 probably. Then what do you think Disney is going to do? All of a suddden make a Rey or Finn show? Hahaha I really doubt that. 

Filoni has delivered with the clone wars and rebels. He has proven he can write amazing stories while having his hands tied(bc he has sw lore to adhere to.) 

The problem in Kennedy’s eyes is Dave Filoni doesn’t look the part, isn’t a woman and could care less what she wants bc he is only concerned with staying true to what Lucas began. 

All Kennedy really has to do is set back and let them turn it around and she can come out of this, as much as I would hate it, in a good spot, having helped return Star Wars to its peak. I do not see that from her at all. She just cannot stand people like ideas that aren’t hers. 

The woke movement has good intentions at heart but a population isn’t much different then a 3 year old. If you tell them to be one way they will most likely not listen bc no one wants told what to do. However if they can be swayed that way by great storytelling in the subtlest way that’s fine with me. All stories have morals. It’s just stupid for Kennedy to assume shoving the moral in our face before the story is even told “the force is female t shirts” will actually work. 

Has anyone thought about Bill Burr? I guarantee Kennedy didn’t want to hire him. He is as anti woke as anyone I’ve ever heard from. That’s just Favreau rubbing his clout he has now in her face. Lmao. 

John Favreau is so much smarter then her. So is Filoni and so is Feige. 

Here’s to a wonderful decade full of amazing Star Wars that in the process explains what was wrong with the sequels while simultaneously undoing them.","After WandaVision, Loki, spiderman3 antman 3 and dr.

I’m a relatively new Star Wars fan (started watching in July of 2020). Honestly, if it weren’t for Star Wars, I don’t see how I could have survived through 2020 with my sanity intact.

The pandemic made sure I lost every opportunity I had created for myself through four years of college. Everything. A decent source of income, most of my self-confidence and dignity, and above all, hope.

Even buying Disney+ was a screw up on my part. I wanted to buy Amazon Prime and ended up buying Disney+. Maybe watching MCU’s superheroes live out their larger-than-life dreams could instil in me a sense of confidence, but no (BTW, MCU’s universe has a ridiculously low rewatch value – at least for me).

Switched over to watching Star Wars, and life started getting better. Almost magically. Luke’s story of clinging on to that last bit of hope inspired me. I started seeing more opportunities, talking to like-minded people more, and enjoying myself, even if a little bit. Life picked up.

Yesterday, I got a job. Finally. In this post-Covid market. I’m talking to my friends about stargazing trips (again, after many, many years). I have begun seeing hope – finally.

Sorry about this rant. I just had to let it out. Don’t know if it fits the sub’s rules or not.

Remember, there’s always hope. If you see hard enough, you’ll see it. If you see it, fight for it.

1,"...the Grysk Hegemony.

I'm sorry if someone has already posted something similar but I've looked before and couldn't find any theories on it so here is my own.

For those who don't know, the Grysk are a warlike species from the Unknown Region who, for decades, have been amassing a fleet to invade the galaxy. In essence, the Grysk are Disney's version of the Yuuzhan Vong, who, for those of you that are fans of Star War Legends, brought untold destruction to the galaxy.

My theory is this: in the time between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, the Grysk invaded the galaxy, brought a similar level of destruction to the galaxy, and the Mandalorian is Disney's way of introducing us to this new storyline. First, let's backtrack a bit. The Grysk are a species known by the Chiss and brought to the attention of the Empire by Grand Admiral Thrawn. In fact, this was the premise of Thrawn: Alliances and Thrawn: Treason. According to Thrawn: Treason, the Grysk has already begun making small advances into imperial territory in 1BBY (the same time as the final season of Star Wars: Rebels). In addition, we know from these books that the Chiss are either currently engaged or about to become engaged in a civil war which will be used to the Grysks advantage. Adding to the Grysks favor, the Galactic Civil War causes the collapse of the Empire, which was perhaps the only military power capable of defeating them.

Now at the end of Star Wars: Rebels Grand Admiral Thrawn disappears with Ezra to who-knows-where but we know from the Mandalorian that he is not dead and that Ahsoka is looking for him. Furthermore, in the Mandalorian, when the New Republic officer talks to Cara Dune, he tells her that there is ""something going on out here"" and that no one in the Core worlds believes it. Some might be inclined to believe that he's referring to the Empire reorganizing itself into the First Order but I'm more inclined to believe that its the Empire, or at least a remnant led by Thrawn, trying to strengthen itself against the Grysk.

The fact is, the Sequel trilogy takes place 35 years after Return of the Jedi and so there is no reason why the New Republic would've let the First Order build a superweapon like Starkiller Base during this time. However, what if the New Republic was relatively powerless to stop the First Order from rising because they were weakened while fighting the Grysk? The biggest piece of evidence I have for this is Coruscant. Why is it that Coruscant, which was the home to the Republic and the Empire, is not the capital of the New Republic? What makes Hosnian Prime so special that it replaces Coruscant as the capital? I believe that Coruscant was attacked and even invaded by the Grysk during their invasion (similar to the Vong's invasion of Coruscant) and so the New Republic was forced to make Hosnian Prime its new capital. This is further supported by the fact that we know that by the events of the Force Awakens, Coruscant had fallen into lawlessness and was overrun by criminals. This would also explain why we never see Coruscant in the sequels when yet we see other familiar planets/moons like Endor and Bespin--because Disney didn't want to spoil it.

Adding to my evidence are the newly announce Ahsoka and Rangers of the New Republic TV shows. Both are set around the time of the Mandalorian and so we can guess what the Ahsoka show will be about--Thrawn. More importantly though, this Ahsoka show will most likely be our (the viewer) first introduction on-screen to the Grysk and will be about Ahsoka learning about them from Thrawn and maybe even Ezra. If this is true, then this will most likely lead to Luke's New Jedi Order beginning to learn about the threat of the Grysk.

However, we have little news of Rangers of the New Republic but I believe it will deal with the New Republic becoming aware of the Grysk. In fact, according to Disney's blog regarding the announcement of this show, Rangers and Ahsoka will ""intersect with future stories and culminate into a climactic story event"". &lt;----The Grysk.

It's happening! The Grysk are coming and the galaxy will be in for a rude awakening.

1,"Hello everyone!
My friend and I have decided to embark on rewriting and ironing out the kinks and mistakes in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. We’ve identified the majority of big things that people don’t like from the different reviews, complaints and forums, but I wanted to ask for different things here. We plan on putting the finished book (s?) on Archive of our own, so it will be accessible to those who plan on reading it. 

The main thing that we are changing is that we plan on going more into the first order. The main complaint we’ve seen about them is that we don’t know anything about them. We also plan on adding midichlorians into it, backstory for Finn, Rey (no palpatine) and Ben. We plan on cutting Snoke out from the beginning and making Kylo the supreme leader. 

The force awakens: So we’re including midichlorians (from the prequels). The idea is that they’re trying to rebuild the Jedi. They make “clones” and use them as younglings. Ben is not strong with the force, and has a lot of mental health issues that the adults in his life like to gloss over. In the movies, it’s revealed that Luke saw the darkness in Ben’s heart and tried to kill him- which makes no fucking sense but I won’t get into it. In our rewrite, Ben tries to kill himself. The Skywalkers have a blood curse that prevent them from being killed by anyone who isn’t of their bloodline, but it makes their blood toxic. Ben, in his haze, assumes that Luke was trying to kill him and runs away to join the first order that’s more like communism in theory than how it was used. He becomes a sort of anti-hero portrayed as a villain because the resistance comes in and wipes out the majority of the younglings to end the Jedi because they’re corrupt as shit and he gets the blame for it. Rey and Finn are two of the younglings who escape. Ben finds them (he’s about 10 years older than them) and puts Rey on her planet and takes Finn in as a stormtrooper. The force awakens is basically the same from there.

I’d love to get any opinions on the ideas and plot- any characters or ideas from other Star Wars media that you think would be cool to add?

1,"Let's get one thing straight. I used to believe Anakin did nothing wrong, as it was because of the circumstances the Jedi put him in, he was backed into a corner and had no choice. 

But... I went into group therapy for a year, where they specialize in preventing domestic violence. 

And one of the things I learned in the class are these forms of control and power, along with abusing the person you're with - blaming, minimizing, and denial. 

Blaming is when you put the blame of your actions onto somebody or something else - the way many people blame the Jedi Order for Anakin's actions and turn to the dark side. 

Minimizing is when you minimize an action you do. For instance, if you closed fist punch someone in the face, you say ""I only smacked you in the face! It wasn't that bad!"" 

And I think we all know what denial is - it's when you straight up deny your actions. ""I didn't punch you! What are you talking about? You're crazy!"" 

Due to this, I learned to take responsibility for my actions. It doesn't matter what anybody or anything does, I am water, not soda. If you shake a bottle of water, nothing happens. If you shake a bottle of soda, it explodes.  Basically, it shouldn't matter that the Jedi kidnapped Anakin and took him away from his mom, never trusted him, always looked down on him, etc. None of that is a justificatory reason for Anakin's horrific actions. 

In real life, if ANYBODY killed a school of children, I highly doubt any Anakin defenders would jump onto defending this cold hearted, horrible individual.... So why is Anakin so defended? 

He not only killed an entire school of young Padawan, who are all children between the ages of like 5-10. And on top of that, he is worse than Hitler. Come on, dude issued the Death Star which DESTROYED AN ENTIRE PLANET! He slaughtered probably hundreds of thousands of people, and nothing, and I mean NOTHING justifies that action. 

How would you feel if someone decided to randomly destroy Earth, and all of its inhabitants? Kill off all of your friends, family, people you will never meet now who could change your life, and if you don't care about humans and care more about pets... Anakin killed all your dogs, all your cats, all your lizards and snakes and fish and literally every single thing on the planet. 

How are people defending this monster? I don't get it anymore. 

Dude is a pure and utter horrific monster. Anakin Skywalker is, not Darth Vader because guess what, they are the SAME PERSON! And this can be seen as blaming, again, which is a means of power and control. Anakin, Luke, everybody who defends Anakin puts the blame on Darth Vader. ""Anakin didn't do it, Darth Vader did."" Yeah, no, that doesn't work. Anakin IS Darth Vader and Anakin killed millions. Don't put the blame on some made up person and take responsibility for your actions, Anakin. 

Sorry for the long rant, but I feel this must be said. It's important to one's livelihood to have a good mental health, and seeing Anakin as a good person... Isn't really healthy. And I would know, because I wasn't mentally healthy when I believe Anakin did nothing wrong.",Anakin Skywalker - why do people defend this horrible person?,let s get one thing straight  i used to believe anakin did nothing wrong  as it was because of the circumstances the jedi put him in  he was backed into a corner and had no choice  but    i went into group therapy for a year  where they specialize in preventing domestic violence  and one of the things i learned in the class are these forms of control and power  along with abusing the person you re with   blaming  minimizing  and denial  blaming is when you put the blame of your actions onto somebody or something else   the way many people blame the jedi order for anakin s actions and turn to the dark side  minimizing is when you minimize an action you do  for instance  if you closed fist punch someone in the face  you say  i only smacked you in the face  it wasn t that bad   and i think we all know what denial is   it s when you straight up deny your actions   i didn t punch you  what are you talking about  you re crazy   due to this  i learned to take responsibility for my actions  it doesn t matter what anybody or anything does  i am water  not soda  if you shake a bottle of water  nothing happens  if you shake a bottle of soda  it explodes   basically  it shouldn t matter that the jedi kidnapped anakin and took him away from his mom  never trusted him  always looked down on him  etc  none of that is a justificatory reason for anakin s horrific actions  in real life  if anybody killed a school of children  i highly doubt any anakin defenders would jump onto defending this cold hearted  horrible individual     so why is anakin so defended  he not only killed an entire school of young padawan  who are all children between the ages of like 5 10  and on top of that  he is worse than hitler  come on  dude issued the death star which destroyed an entire planet  he slaughtered probably hundreds of thousands of people  and nothing  and i mean nothing justifies that action  how would you feel if someone decided to randomly destroy earth  and all of its inhabitants  kill off all of your friends  family  people you will never meet now who could change your life  and if you don t care about humans and care more about pets    anakin killed all your dogs  all your cats  all your lizards and snakes and fish and literally every single thing on the planet  how are people defending this monster  i don t get it anymore  dude is a pure and utter horrific monster  anakin skywalker is  not darth vader because guess what  they are the same person  and this can be seen as blaming  again  which is a means of power and control  anakin  luke  everybody who defends anakin puts the blame on darth vader   anakin didn t do it  darth vader did   yeah  no  that doesn t work  anakin is darth vader and anakin killed millions  don t put the blame on some made up person and take responsibility for your actions  anakin  sorry for the long rant  but i feel this must be said  it s important to one s livelihood to have a good mental health  and seeing anakin as a good person    isn t really healthy  and i would know  because i wasn t mentally healthy when i believe anakin did nothing wrong anakin skywalker   why do people defend this horrible person

1,"I really liked The Last Jedi. It gave a new feel in the SW universe and really showed the war that is in star wars. However there were 3 things plot wise that I can't roll over and accept. I believe if these things were addressed in a minor edit, the movie might be more widely accepted, rather a movie like TROS which needs a whole new cut to be salvaged.

1. Poe and Leia's character arc

Poe's whole arc in TLJ is to learn to be less a one man super warrior focused on the objective and more a commander whose focused on the lives of his comrads. Leia tries to teach him this by expressing how many lives, including the bombing fleet, were wiped out  and those casualties should've been avoided by fleeing the fight. Later in the movie, they land on a base on Crait and Poe is still thinking about his failure. Problem is, the Dreadnought can wipe out bases with a single shot from orbit, as they did with the Resistance's first base in the beginning of the film. So if Poe did not risk the lives of the bombing fleet and destroy the dreadnought, Husk/Kylo Ren could've just ordered the dreadnought to blow up the Crait base from orbit. Now, all of this could've been fixed with a simple line like ""This old base is so reinforced, not even a dreadnought blast can take it down."" Cheesy? Yes, but it leaves audience members like me not questioning whether Poe was right all along.

2. Finn and Rose's Bogus Adventure

I really like both of these characters, yet I felt half of the film was spent on an adventure with no real pay out, mainly for the plot convenience of having 2 main characters not stay on the ship. It felt like one of those TV shows where they send half the cast on an adventure that episode just for it to lead to nothing and serve as no consequence to the greater show. I felt like every point they tried to establish either fell flat or, most importantly, had no pay off in the film or in TROS. 

Rose tries to explain to Finn not to run away, ending his timid character arc (that is fixed in the first 5 minutes of them meeting).

Rose tries to tell Finn that the nice things in the galaxy are probably just rich people abusing their wealth and power (never going back to this thought).

DJ explains to Finn that the good guy vs bad guy thing is wrong, that people are not just one or the other and the same people selling your equipment sells to the FO as well. (Never bringing this great philosophical point up again)

They meet a slave kid who is force sensitive and gives him a Resistance ring. The kid later stares in the sky at the end of the movie and shows the audience he's force sensitive, only for the movies to abandon him and this plot entirely.

They fail the entire 40+ minute mission of getting the code breaker (wrong guy) and get captured. But its fine because we had a different plot going on the whole time with trying to make it to Crait. It just felt like a terrible side story with no pay off or message that is throughly embedded. If they hammered one of these points in the whole adventure or just gave a plot payout for those characters for taking the adventure, other than the plot convenience of being on the Supreme ship to have a rematch with Phasma, I would've accepted the entire adventure. 

3. Luke forgets about Redemption

I really like hermit Luke. As far as I'm aware, hermit Luke was even in George Lucas' original drafts of Ep 7/8 because he didn't want the main hero coming in and wiping away the new heroes problems. What I absolutely despised was the 3 version flashback of how Ben became Kylo. It makes perfect sense that Luke looses his order and goes to exile because he feels responsible. It does not make sense that Luke Skywalker, the man who spent an entire movie trying to convince the galaxy's #1 murderer to become good again, sees a dark vision of his wannabedarthvader nephew, and decides to kill him in his sleep. Its just, not in his character to do that. Even if Ben was in the middle of his blitzkrieg of the galaxy, Luke would still try to convince him of returning to the light. Immediately giving up on his family member because of a chance/ a vision of the future is ridiculous for his character. 

Look these are a few things that really bug me from the writing perspective because some things in the film happen purely for plot convenience rather than ultimate payoffs which a long running universe like SW always is good at, see Mandalorian. Unfortunately I see having a one man Rian Johnson director/writer be the problem. Even in the BTS of TLJ you can see Luke and Rian arguing about the direction of the character and Rian says something along the lines of ""I get how you feel but just do the story as its written for you."" If a writer is stuck in his head with a grand story idea with so much going on, he looses perspectives that other writers should've called him out on. Like I said, with minor dialog edits and maybe a cut or two, TLJ would stand as one of the bests imo, it doesn't need a massive overhaul or reedit like TROS.",RANT: The Last Jedi is a good movie but needs some serious edits,i really liked the last jedi  it gave a new feel in the sw universe and really showed the war that is in star wars  however there were 3 things plot wise that i can t roll

1,"Though I only found the sequels mediocre at best and really bad at some points at worst,I feel like there's a lot of potential in the sequels to be expanded upon.


Take the sith eternal for example.


Sure the movie pretty much tells you that they're all dead and buried,but just because 1 hideout of sith cultists on 1 planet in the middle of nowhere in the unknown region is destroyed,that doesn't mean that the whole freaking thing is just gone(unless the sith eternal is only on exegol then in that case I'm dumb) 


Plus,I don't think we see the more esoteric and fanatical side of the empire/imperial remnant enough. Seeing an imperial remnant like the sith eternal is very interesting in my opinion. I kind of want them to bring the sith eternal back, I want them to fight not only the new republic,but also other imperial remnants too. we already know in legends that there was an imperial civil war, so why not take that and put that into canon?besides, stormtroopers and rebels may hate each other, but no one likes a heavily armed, belligerent,angry cultist,no matter what side you're on.

1,"What do you guys think the Old Republic era should look like in the new canon? 

I'm probably gonna get a lot of crap for this, but personally, I hope Lucasfilm/Disney don't feel pressured to be 100% faithful to Legends. 

Regardless of how you feel about the new canon, we know that the old EU was much less organised in comparison, so sometimes you'd get designs that look out of place in the SW universe, some that look simply terrible and at its worst, you get both. 

Specifically, I'm talking about things like:

*  [Jedi](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f7/62/ab/f762ab895d8275e4d88be41921a8ed9d.jpg) \- Why does this guy look like a Mandalorian with Jedi robes? Stylistically, it looks like generic modern sci-fi (à la Halo or Destiny) instead of something Ralph McQuarrie or Doug Chiang would design. 
* [Republic troopers](https://i.redd.it/9hwds5kbnan21.jpg) \- They had more than a 1000 years of evolution to consider and the best they could come up with is something that looks like an advanced Phase 2 clone trooper.  
* [Darth Bane](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/3/3f/Darthbane.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110127012313) \- This is probably the best example. The [new canon version](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/6a9cd46f-4337-4a06-8570-7da116919bbf) we got is 100 times better than the weird Power Rangers villain they had in the old EU.

I think the main issue is that they didn't really think about the artistic and cultural influences of the original designs by McQuarrie, Chiang, Lucas, etc. so a lot of things ended up looking very uninspired.",Old Republic Aesthetic and Design in the new canon,what do you guys think the old republic era should look like in the new canon  i m probably gonna get a lot of crap for this  but personally  i hope lucasfilm disney don t feel pressured to be 100  faithful to legends  regardless of how you feel about the new canon  we know that the old eu was much less organised in comparison  so sometimes you d get designs that look out of place in the sw universe  some that look simply terrible and at its worst  you get both  specifically  i m talking about things like     jedi      why does this guy look like a mandalorian with jedi robes  stylistically  it looks like generic modern sci fi  à la halo or destiny  instead of something ralph mcquarrie or doug chiang would design     republic troopers      they had more than a 1000 years of evolution to consider and the best they could come up with is something that looks like an advanced phase 2 clone trooper      darth bane      this is probably the best example  the  new canon version   we got is 100 times better than the weird power rangers villain they had in the old eu i think the main issue is that they didn t really think about the artistic and cultural influences of the original designs by mcquarrie  chiang  lucas  etc  so a lot of things ended up looking very uninspired old republic aesthetic and design in the new canon
1,"The Rebel Alliance are divided and some of their actions are worse than you think to the point that if you read Tales from Jabba's Palace, did you believe Boba Fett was right about them not starting the war?

If they didn't, casualties would not have piled up to the likes of Galen, Saw, Chirrut, Jyn, Cassian, Bodhi,  Baze, etc.

Even though what he said was from Legends, he is right since restoring the Republic allowed more conflicts to rise up like the Yuuzhon Vong, Galactic Alliance Guard, Krayt's Empire, First Order, etc.

The Republic may have gotten better but it keeps getting worse the moment another threat comes out.

Heck Boba Fett believes that the Empire brought forth the very order to the galaxy by exterminating the Jedi and the Republic's corruption and even if they had remained intact had Palpatine were to be alive, he would have no problem handling the upcoming Yuuzhon Vong threat and whatever is coming to him. 

The Republic/Rebel Alliance/Jedi should have just stayed quiet to the point that it would all be over in seconds thanks to Palpatine.

Linear version that follows roughly the show:
This would start a little before Chapter One. We follow roughly the same story (add a few more side quests if you’re feeling it). At the same time make it a customizable experience. If someone can fly the Razor Crest well enough then make it possible to avoid crashing on the spider planet from Season 2. Some larger choices would be things like choosing to shoot IG or not. The open world element would be traveling from planet to planet at will as well as large maps for each planet, similar to fallen order with a larger sandbox element.

New Story, new hero:
Make an open world Star Wars with either a different mandalorian or even a different character entirely. Just make sure they’re a loner in the galaxy, preferably a bounty hunter. Add ship customization, armor swapping, and adding a scrapper feature would be fun. Players could find old clone armor and “scrap” it to fit there overall look as well as an option to do the same with your ship.

1,"While not every change to the original trilogy that was made in the special editions was perfect, there were some parts that made it feel more connected to the rest of the films, like replacing the actors of the emperor and boba felt in episode 5 so that it’s the same throughout the series. So What about minor changes to the sequel trilogy? Things like like Rey or Kylo ren having visions or hearing the voice of the emperor in their mind, but not knowing who it is at the time. Something that just makes the trilogy feel more connected, but would be relatively easy to add in. I know some comics like “the rise of Kylo Ren” give us some of that, but if your just going off the films, I think it’d be a nice addition.

Mon Mothma was born into a political family; her father was an arbiter-general in the Galactic Republic, and her mother was a governor on their homeworld of Chandrila

Bail Organa was a politician and a member of the royal family of Alderaan

Padme was a Queen

Leia was a princess 

These aren't exactly rank and file in touch with the plight of regular people. 

Meanwhile, slavery and indentured servitude still existed and thrived under the Republic. Common people struggled greatly under the Republic. 

So instead of several elite wealthy people governing , they were replaced by one elite wealthy person in Palpatine (who was also born into wealth)

And who paid the price for their squabbles? The poor and those born into service.

1,"I’ve Seen a lot of People talking about how they don’t like how Rey and Kylo Ren were using force heal out of no where so I thought I would explain it. 

Force Healing is a Dark side power, and that’s why it’s not commonly taught or used by the jedi. Force healing is also not a new power, it’s first mentioned in Episode 3. The ability to save people from dying Palpatine spoke of was force healing. The Only reason Rey knows how to force heal is because she read the ancient Jedi texts. Those books where written long before the Jedi had an anti Dark side stance. The only reason Kylo Ren knows how to force heal is because Luke taught him how.

Luke tapped into the dark side on some occasions, like when he force choked Jabba’s guards, or when he crushed a Dark trooper on Mando recently. Luke based his teachings on what Yoda taught him, and what he learned from the ancient texts. 

It also takes extreme amounts of power to be able to force heal. That’s why Kylo Dies when he force heals Rey, he never finished his training. That’s also why we only Know Luke, Anakin, Palpatine, Darth Plagueis, Leia, Rey, and Kylo had the ability or the potiential to force heal.",Why Rey and Kylo Ren used Force Heal.,i ve seen a lot of people talking about how they don t like how rey and kylo ren were using force heal out of no where so i thought i would explain it  force healing is a dark side power  and that s why it s not commonly taught or used by the jedi  force healing is also not a new power  it s first mentioned in episode 3  the ability to save people from dying palpatine spoke of was force healing  the only reason rey knows how to force heal is because she read the ancient jedi texts  those books where written long before the jedi had an anti dark side stance  the only reason kylo ren knows how to force heal is because luke taught him how luke tapped into the dark side on some occasions  like when he force choked jabba s guards  or when he crushed a dark trooper on mando recently  luke based his teachings on what yoda taught him  and what he learned from the ancient texts  it also takes extreme amounts of power to be able to force heal  that s why kylo dies when he force heals rey  he never finished his training  that s also why we only know luke  anakin  palpatine  darth plagueis  leia  rey  and kylo had the ability or the potiential to force heal why rey and kylo ren used force heal

1,"Thank you guys, gals, and grogus.

I’ve been a fan of SW since I first watched ANH in 1997, but it was always a casual fan, see the movies in the theaters, get the DVD’s and just enjoy every now and again because it’s Star Wars. There was no other reason really. 

2020 was a lot. Understatement. One plus side has been that it has allowed me to really explore my love for Star Wars. I’m the kind of person that really gets into the lore of a galaxy like Star Wars, but due to my own insecurities I always kind of kept it to myself. 

Anyway, my roommate and I obviously watched the first season of the Mandalorian, and he saw the love I have for this universe so he pushed me to kinda just be open about it. It’s amaZing how much your love for something even deepens when your encouraged to share that. 

So this year has really shown me not only how special this franchise is, but also how communities like this subreddit are. How the fans really make you appreciate it and act as A lens to see the beauty in everything from the cinematography, to how shows like The Clone Wars  add to the main saga while expanding g the universe, to how you can start seeing recurring themes, moments, etc. Its what I take George Lucas to mean by when he said, “it rhymes.” 

It has made this year suck just a bit less and provided a point of joy, familiarity, and community to return to when we’ve all felt alone this year. So thank you, I am Grateful for all of you, and SW.

Yes, he’s directed/written some episodes, and he certainly has more of a hand in the show than other directors. I also think he Exec Produces it, as well. All in all, Dave is definitely the #2 guy and has a ton of say in how the show plays out, but I feel like people forget that it is Jon’s show! Jon is the main writer and creator of the show and people are always posting stuff giving Dave credit that really should be given to Jon. 

It’s not that I don’t want to give Dave his due credit, it’s just that I don’t want to overlook credit that should be given to Jon! 

All in all, this is just something I’ve noticed and I don’t think people realize that it isn’t Jon and Dave’s show, it’s Jon’s show, Dave’s just right with Jon and has a lot of input for the shows direction.

1,"Hey all.

So, I don't know about you guys, but since I was a kid I always wondered why the hell did Vader fall when fighing Luke in Return Of The Jedi. I'm not talking about when Luke kicks him down the stairs, but the moment right before he cuts off Vader's hand. If you look that duel carefully you notice that Vader kinda simply gives up for no reason and stays there with his saber rised up and doing nothing. 

I think you could say that he was overwhelmed by Luke's fury and that might be the canon explanation if by chance there is one, but I think that the actual reason was simply and unfortunately: bad coreography. Or to say it better: bad coreography execution. Let me explain why: If you look at the Behind the scenes of that particular moment (that footage wasn't used in the final cut of the movie though) Luke actually pushes Vader on the railing and he falls becaus of being pushed naturally. I think that when they shot the actual scene that we got, Mark Hamill forgot to push Vader aside, but David Prowse fell anyway and for some reason they kept it like that.

There's actually the same ""problem"" in Wrestling fights during the so called ""botches"" in which one of the two fighters behaves like he was hit despite the fact that the opponent accidentally didn't performe the move properly.

So what do you guys think? Have you ever noticed this particular moment, or is it just me?",I think I know why Vader fell when fighting Luke in ROTJ,hey all so  i don t know about you guys  but since i was a kid i always wondered why the hell did vader fall when fighing luke in return of the jedi  i m not talking about when luke kicks him down the stairs  but the moment right before he cuts off vader s hand  if you look that duel carefully you notice that vader kinda simply gives up for no reason and stays there with his saber rised up and doing nothing  i think you could say that he was overwhelmed by luke s fury and that might be the canon explanation if by chance there is one  but i think that the actual reason was simply and unfortunately  bad coreography  or to say it better  bad coreography execution  let me explain why  if you look at the behind the scenes of that particular moment  that footage wasn t used in the final cut of the movie though  luke actually pushes vader on the railing and he falls becaus of being pushed naturally  i think that when they shot the actual scene that we got  mark hamill forgot to push vader aside  but david prowse fell anyway and for some reason they kept it like that there s actually the same  problem  in wrestling fights during the so called  botches  in which one of the two fighters behaves like he was hit despite the fact that the opponent accidentally didn t performe the move properly so what do you guys think  have you ever noticed this particular moment  or is it just me i think i know why vader fell when fighting luke in rotj

1,"//SPOILER WARNING FOR THE NEW TRILOGY, AND THE MANDALORIAN//
 First ill point out the most obvious example which is palpatine coming back from the dead as a clone.

The old cannon had this very plotline except instead of using grogu's dna they used Luke's. In my opinion using Luke's dna makes even less sense as capturing Luke seems way less believable than capturing grogu.

Secondly we have the ""like the death star but bigger"" trope; this happened alot in legends a few notable examples are the star crusher, and star destroyers outfitted with deathstar laser's which is basically identical to what we saw in the rise of Skywalker.

The fact is that the original trilogy did not have a good opening for additional content at least not revolving around the characters from the original saga.

I think that's one of the reasons why the mandalorian did so well as main movie characters are mostly kept to a minimum, Luke only appears in one episode and by his time being brief it sticks to what is required for him to do. Save the day, and take grogu for training.
Boba fett is the only other movie character we see and he fits in because the format fits with his character.

Combine these factors with the 30+ years of expectations from fans and i don't think we could have ever had a super good new trilogy involving the original characters.

1," Quick Summary:

**Legends**: Order 66 is one of 150 Contingency Order for the GAR, and the Clones are shady from the start. They know their true purpose and willingly execute Order 66. The Clones have unquestioning loyalty and murder their Jedi Generals in cold-blood. The Clones are completely aware of their actions. 

**Canon**: The Clones are implanted w/ inhibitor chips at the earliest stages of their development. When Palpatine issues Order 66, these chips activate and forces the Clones to comply w/ Order 66. The inhibitor chips takes away the Clones’ agency and individuality.

**Personal Opinion**: I prefer the retcon Canon version as it's more logical. Prior to TCW, the Legends version made sense because the Clones barely had any character development except for that they have ""unquestioning loyalty"". However, TCW has portrayed the Clones as individuals who developed personalities, made decisions and defied orders they deemed wrong. The Jedi and Clones developed strong bonds as TCW progresses. Also, it’s cruel how the inhibitor chips takes away the Clones’ agency and individuality.",Question - Do You Prefer the Legends or Canon Version of Order 66?, quick summary   legends    order 66 is one of 150 contingency order for the gar  and the clones are shady from the start  they know their true purpose and willingly execute order 66  the clones have unquestioning loyalty and murder their jedi generals in cold blood  the clones are completely aware of their actions    canon    the clones are implanted w  inhibitor chips at the earliest stages of their development  when palpatine issues order 66  these chips activate and forces the clones to comply w  order 66  the inhibitor chips takes away the clones  agency and individuality   personal opinion    i prefer the retcon canon version as it s more logical  prior to tcw  the legends version made sense because the clones barely had any character development except for that they have  unquestioning loyalty   however  tcw has portrayed the clones as individuals who developed personalities  made decisions and defied orders they deemed wrong  the jedi and clones developed strong bonds as tcw progresses  also  it s cruel how the inhibitor chips takes away the clones  agency and individuality question   do you prefer the legends or canon version of order 66

I found a Tumblr post that mentioned that in the Revenge of the Sith novelization when Palpatine is trying to turn Anakin, he tries to convince Ani that Obi Wan is having an affair with a senator. Anakin asks Palpatine who HE is, referring to the senator Obi Wan is rumored to have an affair with.

I couldn't find anything else about this, and I don't have access to the novel so I was wondering if any of you could confirm this occurance.

Someone mentions it might have something to do with either the German *TroopenKorps* (or something like that - Lucas loved German terms, like '*vader*' for 'father'), or maybe that it referred to who the troops were assigned to / which unit they're a part of.

Like, say, the ISB (Agent Kallus from Rebels is ISB-021), or, drumroll... Tarkin.

TK - and the reason we hear so many TK troopers is because Tarkin was Governor and later Grand Moff of the ENTIRE OUTER RIM (a huge part of the Galaxy, where a majority of post-Yavin action happens) ; and so I imagine it's not out of the question that the Empire might have given Tarkin's letters of 'TK' as the regional designation for the Outer Rim.

Other far-fetched theories of mine include more planet-based designations - like, again in Rebels, the troopers designated LS-515 or LS-005 might have stood for 'Lothal Service'.

1,"In my opinion Still one of the Top 10 best multiplayer shooter games ever created. Star Wars Jedi Knight two combined elements or Lightsabers, Force Powers, a variety of gadgets and Blasters. Especially since we saw the unveiling of dark troopers in Star Wars canon in The Mandelorian. 

Single player stories was fun and interesting, following the journey of a former imperial operative turned rebel alliance mercenary, then his discovery of force sensitivity leading to a path to becoming a Jedi. Kyle Katarn and Jan (his counterpart) was the original operatives who stole the deathstar plans. They faced off against imperial inquisitors, the dark troopers project, imperial remnants trying to create force sensitive soldiers and cultists trying to resurrect ancient sith lords.

Then when Jedi Knight Two: Jedi Outcast was released. The multiplayer.....just...wow, incredible and still one of the best balanced competitive multiplayer games ever created and could stand toe to toe with apex legends, overwatch, quake. All of the quick paced multiplayer shooters. Team deathmatch, Capture the flag was multidimensional and interesting due to the simultaneous use of force Powers, lightsabers, weapons and gadgets. First person shooter switching back and force to third person lightsaber combat.

Force Powers were balanced neutral, lightside and darkside to choose from, blasting out force lightning, force pushing, pulling enemies off ledges or holding back flag runners, force choking and lifting enemies off deadly falls. Blocking blaster bolts was automatic depending on if you weren't swinging around your lightsaber, different weights of use and attacking. Simplistic lightsaber use no showboating lightsaber combo attacks (jedi knight 3 jedi academy featured some after also introducing double bladed or dual wielding lightsabers). You could force throw your lightsaber like a boomerang.

Then there were the weapons and gadgets like portable turrets, deflector shield screens, mines. Then the weapons. The absolutely wonderful variety with secondary firing modes (Personal favorite was the TL-50 imperial repeater with the secondary concussion blasts {btw EA/ Dice thank you for bringing that back in Battlefront Two! I was ecstatic seeing that gem}). Force Powers had offensive and defensive use in conjunction with weapons. I could force push away rocket launcher rockets or I'd fire concussion blasts at an opposing teams base and my buddy was propelling them further with force push, use ""force speed"" run circles around enemies while going full auto with my E-11 blaster. This game needs a comeback. Especially with today's technology and physics. Maybe even see what crazier simultaneous force power and blaster use can do with new physics.

Not as clumsy or random as a today's games; an elegant multiplayer FPS for a more civilized age 🤣. 

I know a lot of us fans would love to see all this make a comeback. Keep Jedi Knight as simple as it used to be ""with the exception of some new game engine tech for more destructible environments and world physics. Keep it mostly the same.

I truly think the force sensitive mercenary Kyle can be brought back. Whether it's a ""Fallen Order"" situation of him becoming a Merc or perhaps escaping the Knights of Ren's temple massacre further up the timeline and making a living as a mercenary.

Favreau and Filoni gave the fandom exactly what they wanted last season of Mando, it's time Star Wars gaming gets the same love of being made by fans for fans knowing what the others want. If you want to microtransction different skins (weapons and characters), lightsaber hilts or beams/ colors fine. Nothing that unbalances the game and keeps it's original spirit.",We need a Canocal reimagining of one of the EUs most Iconic hero's and a reboot of their games.

1,"**Revenge of the Sith** 7/10 

This was the first Star Wars movie I saw (brothers told me the first 2 episodes of the prequels suck so we skipped). I thought it actually did make sense even without the context of the first 2. Overall the movie was wildly entertaining, but extremely cheesy. I was making fun of Anakin and Palpatine for most of the movie and not really taking it seriously. I love Obi-Wan though, he's hilarious. In general, this is such a fun movie, I get why people love it. 


**Rogue One** 6/10

This could be a hot take, but I didn't find this movie to be that great. The main characters were just dull in my opinion, which sort of prevented me from caring about the story. It's definitely a lot more well made than Revenge of the Sith, just not nearly as much fun.  I will say, the final 30 minute battle at the end of this movie is amazing  


**A New Hope** 9/10 

This is the movie that made me realize why these movies are popular in the first place. Now I see why the originals are so much more beloved. The first 2 acts of this movie built up the intrigue to insane levels and I found myself hooked on Star Wars. Han Solo and Princess Leia were easily the best characters in my opinion and definitely carried the movie. I don't think Luke by himself would be that entertaining as a main character, but I did love his escapades on Tattooine and Mos Eisley. Though I will say, the third act wasn't nearly as strong as the first 2 acts of this movie. 


**Empire Strikes Back** 10/10 

This movie was amazing. Han and Leia, my favorite characters, had such epic banter through the whole movie, and their journey as fugitives from the empire was entertaining as hell. The scenes with Luke did drag a bit in my opinion, but Yoda was funny and made it work. Once Luke finally goes to Cloud City the movie really picks up to a great 3rd act. I can't really think of any significant flaws with this movie, it's extremely air tight and the characters shine so bright in this. 


**Return of the Jedi** 6/10 

This might be a hot take, but I was underwhelmed by this movie. The Jabba's Palace sequence was cool, plus the final showdown between Luke and Palpatine / Vader was awesome. However this movie felt sort of like a repeat of New Hope, plus I felt a lot of the dialgoue just wasn't quite as snappy or clever, especially the scenes with Han and Leia. Overall it's a decent movie and a good ending to the original trilogy, but they could have done so much more with this. 


**Force Awakens** 6/10 

This movie definitely had awesome visuals and set pieces, but right after watching New Hope and Return of the Jedi it just felt like another movie where the heroes destroy the Death Star. I didn't particularly resonate with the characters nearly as much as I did with the characters in A New Hope and Empire either.  


So yeah those are my thoughts on all the ones I saw. Overall I definitely get the appeal of these movies, especially the original two movies. With that said, it seems like to me they sort of ran out of ideas a long time ago, and at this point are just cashing in.","Just finished my first ever Star Wars marathon, here are my thoughts as a 25 year old who watched them for the first time",  revenge of the sith   7 10 this was the first star wars movie i saw  brothers told me the first 2 episodes of the prequels suck so we skipped   i thought it actually did make sense even without the context of the first 2  overall the movie was wildly entertaining  but extremely cheesy  i was making fun of anakin and palpatine for most of the movie and not really taking it seriously  i love obi wan though  he s hilarious  in general  this is such a fun movie  i get why people love it    rogue one   6 10this could be a hot take  but i didn t find this movie to be that great  the main characters were just dull in my opinion  which sort of prevented me from caring about the story  it s definitely a lot more well made than revenge of the sith  just not nearly as much fun   i will say  the final 30 minute battle at the end of this movie is amazing    a new hope   9 10 this is the movie that made me realize why these movies are popular in the first place  now i see why the originals are so much more beloved  the first 2 acts of this movie built up the intrigue to insane levels and i found myself hooked on star wars  han solo and princess leia were easily the best characters in my opinion and definitely carried the movie  i don t think luke by himself would be that entertaining as a main character  but i did love his escapades on tattooine and mos eisley  though i will say  the third act wasn t nearly as strong as the first 2 acts of this movie    empire strikes back   10 10 this movie was amazing  han and leia  my favorite characters  had such epic banter through the whole movie  and their journey as fugitives from the empire was entertaining as hell  the scenes with luke did drag a bit in my opinion  but yoda was funny and made it work  once luke finally goes to cloud city the movie really picks up to a great 3rd act  i can t really think of any significant flaws with this movie  it s extremely air tight and the characters shine so bright in this    return of the jedi   6 10 this might be a hot take  but i was underwhelmed by this movie  the jabba s palace sequence was cool  plus the final showdown between luke and palpatine   vader was awesome  however this movie felt sort of like a repeat of new hope  plus i felt a lot of the dialgoue just wasn t quite as snappy or clever  especially the scenes with han and leia  overall it s a decent movie and a good ending to the original trilogy  but they could have done so much more with this    force awakens   6 10 this movie definitely had awesome visuals and set pieces  but right after watching new hope and return of the jedi it just felt like another movie where the heroes destroy the death star  i didn t particularly resonate with the characters nearly as much as i did with the characters in a new hope and empire either   so yeah those are my thoughts on all the ones i saw  overall i definitely get the appeal of these movies  especially the original two movies  with that said  it seems like to me they sort of ran out of ideas a long time ago  and at this point are just cashing in just finished my first ever star wars marathon  here are my thoughts as a 25 year old who watched them for the first time

1,"After Return of the Jedi (new edit ending), we see Anakin, Obiwan and Yoda together as ghosts.  In the Clone Wars we learn that Yoda is taught how to keep his spirit alive after death.  We also see that Yoda tells a young Obiwan to learn this power while he's in exile.  In the prequels, Palpatine tells Anakin he cannot learn this power from a Jedi.

My question:  has it been written, shown or proven that enough time elapsed between the transformation of Anakin to Darth and Return of the Jedi for Palpatine to have taught him this power to make the ending of this movie plausible?

Does this in any way make the completely ridiculous resurrection of Princess Leah possible?

1,"(I don’t like the sequels but I don’t mind if other people do. If you enjoy all movies I’m happy for you - and a little jealous bc I want to love all of them too but episodes 8 &amp; 9 just don’t sit right with me.)

I’m just curious because I don’t get it. It’s always TLJ and Rian Johnson but TROS is just as bad. The whole movie is rushed, the plot is too fast paced and there’s no logic or explanation behind random happenings whatsoever. It’s not good as SW, but it also fails as a movie. And still every time when the sequels come up it’s TLJ’s fault that the trilogy is bad.
At least the message of TLJ was good (let the past die, and you don’t have to be someone’s relative to be strong with the force). TROS on the other hand totally lacks meaning. Hux’s and Ben’s turn came out of the blue, Palpatine’s return is so uncalled for (and he - the most powerful and feared being in the galaxy - dies in the most stupid way imaginable) and there’s not one character arc that goes in any direction. But at least we learn that you can be good even as a force sensitive clone’s daughter. Oh and also the fanservice in the movie doesn’t work at all.

So why is TLJ getting more hate? Because it was the first of the two bad movies? Is that all? Or is there something else I can’t see?

I hope this didn’t sound like a rant, it was not my intention, just looking for answers.

1,"Very few people on this planet understand that Star Wars is VERY if not COMPLETELY similar to what is happening here. Next to that, since everyone is connected to the creational power of the universe (or Force), I am 100% sure Starwars Universe is real, somewhere else in the galaxy, maybe another era. Don't believe me? The galaxy is far too big for your human mind to comprehend the possibilities of it, yet it's very logical. Resistance to believing this comes from you feeling like an ant on this planet, working for money and dying later. Also being in a materialistic environment makes you blind to what really is happening.

Many abilities that are described in StarWars are 100% real. Persuasion, telepathy, force push (aka TK), enhanced physical traits, clairvoyance, ""manipulating luck"". One of the greatest attaining eternal life, AKA retaining your intact consciousness and individuality when dying and returning to the force, as you know a few Jedi masters can do.

The force is real, here we call it something else, it's just a ""word"" to point out to something. Basically, it is in everything as it is everything. Light side, dark side, it's in all of you. And it's also selfish bullshit like the Jedi's and Sith's do, to argue their way as the only way. There is only the force, and nothing but the force. After that; you can use it as you like, it's completely neutral. Jedi's and Sith's are just like you guys, judging each other. But again, there is only the creative power that animates everything in the universe. Things just are.

Again, very few are aware of this, but I am. I wonder if there are other ""force sensitives"" here? I'm definitely born with a sensitivity to it and I'm sure I am not alone. I have really cool experiences with the Force and I am here to push it even further, to the limit. Also, ""force sensitivity"" is present in everything and everyone. As I have seen people debate on reddit if everyone can be a Jedi.

I do know everyone has it in them, but what I do not understand is why others (like me) are way more in tune with it and willing to develop that part. All the rest of the people on this planet seem to sleep.","Force Sensitivity, Fiction IS reality -change my mind",very few people on this planet understand that star wars is very if not completely similar to what is happening here  next to that  since everyone is connected to the creational power of the universe  or force   i am 100  sure starwars universe is real  somewhere else in the galaxy  maybe another era  don t believe me  the galaxy is far too big for your human mind to comprehend the possibilities of it  yet it s very logical  resistance to believing this comes from you feeling like an ant on this planet  working for money and dying later  also being in a materialistic environment makes you blind to what really is happening many abilities that are described in starwars are 100  real  persuasion  telepathy  force push  aka tk   enhanced physical traits  clairvoyance   manipulating luck   one of the greatest attaining eternal life  aka retaining your intact consciousness and individuality when dying and returning to the force  as you know a few jedi masters can do the force is real  here we call it something else  it s just a  word  to point out to something  basically  it is in everything as it is everything  light side  dark side  it s in all of you  and it s also selfish bullshit like the jedi s and sith s do  to argue their way as the only way  there is only the force  and nothing but the force  after that  you can use it as you like  it s completely neutral  jedi s and sith s are just like you guys  judging each other  but again  there is only the creative power that animates everything in the universe  things just are again  very few are aware of this  but i am  i wonder if there are other  force sensitives  here  i m definitely born with a sensitivity to it and i m sure i am not alone  i have really cool experiences with the force and i am here to push it even further  to the limit  also   force sensitivity  is present in everything and everyone  as i have seen people debate on reddit if everyone can be a jedi i do know everyone has it in them  but what i do not understand is why others  like me  are way more in tune with it and willing to develop that part  all the rest of the people on this planet seem to sleep force sensitivity  fiction is reality  change my mind

What if the mistake we're all making is viewing things through our own moral lens. We find it unthinkable for clones who are friends of the jedi to kill them because death is horrible. But what if we were raised from birth to fight and not be afraid of death. What if the clones willingly killed the jedi, because in their minds death wasn't that bad. We see clones try their hardest to save their friends, but what if that is less about dying and more about fighting till the end. 

If we actually take a second to consider how they were raised and their environment, then killing their friends and commanders makes a lot of sense. In their minds the jedi dying for the republic just isn't that big a deal. What if the real source of guilt (as seen in battlefront 2) is just the idea of shooting fellow soldiers/breaking the command structure, and the murder aspect isn't even considered.

(Thinking to herself) ""No, he's a monster, he's done things that can't be forgiven."" She fights what she feels because she knows he has done things that would undermine her own identity if she permitted herself to overlook them... but something strange has happened in the time that they have shared in this inexplicable (force) connection... She now knows his mind as if it was her own. The force has bonded their souls into one. She can feel the very suffering, abandonment, betrayal, and rage that lead him to his actions. The sick jester of the rippling circumstances over which he had no control. This visceral pain sat with her like an old friend.. It was a pain she was all too familiar with. She had known it as a dark passenger all her life, but never had the power to rectify it. Who is she to say that if she had had the power Kylo had had since birth that she would not have seeked similar retribution?

She now doubts herself... who she really is..Her mind, her very identity, is now being crushed under the weight of this conflict. So much uncertainty, confusion, struggle, yet standing across from her... Ben. She is utterly certain what she feels about Ben. The crystalline shine of this diamond like clarity feels like ""the light"" compared to the turmoil she feels fighting its overwhelming allure.. Every fiber in her being wants to reach out to him. (in her mind) ""Why am I fighting so hard to deny myself everything I have ever wanted.. this.... it. is. everything...""

And it really is to a scavenger like her... Her entire life she has been nothing to anyone else. She's never had a family, she's never had power or money, and here is a man reaching out his hand to her, offering her everything that she's ever wanted... Love, companionship, power, an existence where she will never have to eek by on 1/4 rations again.. All the things she used to lie awake at night dreaming of having are at her fingertips. Now all she has to do is reach out... and take it.. 

Hesitant at first, but then decisively, she takes his hand, ""Ben"" they embrace in a passionate kiss. As if their whole lives have been a painful and confusing prison of suffering until this very moment, and in this kiss their shackles are dissolved. The scene then changes and they are in a bed chamber, Ben and Rey are shown to be making love, not in an exploitative way, but in a symbolic way of showing their bond being cemented in something they both never thought possible... Complete and total acceptance.

Fast forward in the film and the rebel base standoff scene is playing out similarly to how it played out in the movies. Rey is now by Kylo's side in the AT-AT. Luke is actually physically present, leaving shortly after Rey left, realizing the mistakes he had made after speaking with Yoda and wishing to rectify them. After trying to blow Luke up with blaster fire and failing, Kylo looks at Rey, ""We can only defeat him if we stand together."" They go out to meet Luke in the open and barren field. Kylo confronts Luke about his failures as a master and how he betrayed him. ""You made a mockery of your own teachings, trying to take my life as a boy before I even had the chance to live,"" Luke says, ""I know it must seem that way, but I didn't mean you any harm."" Rey jumps in, ""Liar! I believed you on the island because I wanted to believe you, or in the legend of you... but now I have seen the truth of what you did, who you really are. I see it now as if through my own eyes, I KNOW now that you WERE going to kill him.. (Luke) ""Perspective can be misleading young Rey, search your feelings, you know you have chosen the easy path"" (Rey) ""Shut up! I will not hear any more deceit"" (Luke turns to Ben) ""I know I failed you Ben, I'm sorry"" (Ben sarcastic anger) ""I'm sure you are!"" (Rey) ""You betrayed Ben, you betrayed the Jedi, and now you've failed for the last time!"" 

At that moment Rey springs into action followed closely by Kylo and an epic lightsaber battle ensues. The battle is close but Rey and Kylo are slowly starting to overwhelm Luke, for he is only a pale shadow of his former self. Out of practice and old, Luke struggles mightily, but even now is still able to defend himself and put up a valiant fight against the onslaught of the much younger foes. Using bad ass force abilities to make up for his less than agile older frame, Luke resists the best he can. Try as he might, Kylo and Rey slowly push Luke back toward the entrance of the rebel stronghold. At that moment, near the precipice of the entrance, right as Luke looks as if he is going to be overwhelmed, seemingly out of nowhere, Leia force leaps into the frame!

Leia defensively engages Rey and Kylo briefly with her saber, Kylo stops fighting stunned at seeing his own mother seemingly attack him..
Leia briefly crouches down in a ball.. Summoning all of her energy and focus, along with all of the pain and sadness she feels seeing her own son try to kill her brother.. The air swirls around her, suddenly it goes quiet... A moment of suspense as suddenly she floats in the air, stretches out her body, and cries out a blood curdling scream, unleashing an enormously powerful force push blast. 

Rey and Kylo go flying back hundreds of feet. Leia collapses from the exertion and Luke quickly grabs her and pulls her into the base. They run half hazardly supporting each other toward where the resistance is hiding near the back of the entrance of the cave. Luke then sets Leia down and puts both his hands outstretched above his head... He summons all of his force energy in immense concentration, The mountain itself creaks and cracks dramatically but nothing happens.. Then, slowly, Leia gets up.. Looks at Luke and says, ""let's do this.."" They then work together to use the force to collapse the entrance to the base, pulling the mountain down on itself,  sealing the rebels inside, but more importantly, sealing Kylo and Rey out.

(Leia says assertively) ""Come on there has to be a way out,"" a resistance fighter yells, there's not we already checked!,"" and Luke says, ""there has to be.. you understand?.."" The resistance fighter nods nervously.. Realizing the gravity of the situation they are in.. Leia and Luke then lead the resistance to the back of the base searching for a way out.

Suddenly Finn spots an ice coyote wiggling his way through some rocks.. ""Guys I think I found something!"" Luke and Leia come over to observe, (Finn) ""We can get out this way, use the force to move the rocks!' Luke and Leia look at each other knowing they don't have the strength to move the giant boulders after their massive exertion.. But before they can deliver the bad news there is a loud and blinding explosion.. Bang! Once the dust settles to their surprise they see Chewie waiting for them hovering low in the falcon.. this whole time Chewie had been systematically checking for weak spots in the back of the mountain to see if he could find a way for them to escape. Chewie lands the falcon and emerges with a porg on his shoulder. The porg has ruffled feathers, looking discheveld and beside himself like it had just been though something traumatizing yet funny.. Chewie and Luke embrace as the resistance loads into the falcon. Chewie says something in Wookie along the lines of, ""I knew you'd find your way back"" Luke chuckles and replies, ""Guess this makes it 3 times I owe you pal,"" They then all load into the falcon and speed off into hyperspace and the resistance survives to fight another day.

That's it, hope you enjoyed the read! Go easy on me I'm not much of a writer, but I had fun making it. If theirs enough interest I'll write another one with my idea on how this story line would be concluded in the next movie. Thank you for reading!",What if Rey Turned to the Dark In the Last Jedi?

1,"I was having my morning walk today thinking about Star Wars, as one does, and a thought came to my mind.

Episode 9 could have been better if nothing was changed besides instead if the Emperor the main villain was Thrawn. 

You could change only the emperor’s scenes and the one where Kylo tells Rey that she is Palpatine’s granddaughter everything else would fit quite nicely even the Emperor’s message which would be a total Thrawn move to make.

What are your opinion my friends?",Just a random thought,i was having my morning walk today thinking about star wars  as one does  and a thought came to my mind episode 9 could have been better if nothing was changed besides instead if the emperor the main villain was thrawn  you could change only the emperor s scenes and the one where kylo tells rey that she is palpatine s granddaughter everything else would fit quite nicely even the emperor s message which would be a total thrawn move to make what are your opinion my friends just a random thought

1,"A lot of people wished Lucasarts made Xwing vs Tiefighter into new modern games for the modern internet especially a MMO!  Well they aren't, so I am!

I first made it into a 10v10 MOBA, but couldn't find anyone to play test.   So I figured to make a player base have a Clash of Clans experience so you can play without another person online.  And that is where the game is now, building a base and a huge fleet.  Next update though is a vast MMO.

MMO traits: PVP everywhere, but if you're not flagged for open combat, you get a bounty on your head.  Too big of a bounty and you go to jail for a few hours or days.  When you log in, you can talk to people who visit the jail, maybe smuggle contraband, but you can't talk on the global channel unless someone smuggles in a communication device for you.  

You can buy and sell materials in different zones for trade runes. 
 You can also get bounties for trying to buy and trade goods that are illegal if someone scans your ship.

There will be ""Space Dungeons"" each with different rule sets, like FFA, Team, Highlander, Chess, Capture the Flag, Kill PVE, etc etc.  Every 30 minutes another space dungeon will have an awesome reward and you need to find clues to which one.  Then you compete with other players there too for a good reward.  Not everyone will win every time since of the different rule sets.

There will be wandering mobs, and quests and stuff.  Finally culminating with a never before heard of Space Opera where love Game Masters let you change the course of history with real choices...

1,"Fandom hatred is one idiotic phenomenon which honestly infuriates me.

Do not get me wrong, there are cases when authors/creators get “unintended fans” of their work (such as ‘My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic’) and cases when people are only in the business of creating entertainment media for the sake of money, fame and “spreading of ideologies” without any actual care for the fans. There are even cases in which the original creators themselves have decided to make changes in their works which fans may disagree with (such as ‘The Last of Us’).

With that said, WHO in their bloody right mind actively antagonises the people who are basically giving them money for watching/reading/playing their works?

I get it, it is impossible please everyone.

That said, it should be perfectly possible to be at the very least be civil/logical towards people who have disagreements with your works. It should also be perfectly possible to treat the fandoms that you have gained (such as ‘The Last of Us’) or have inherited from others (such as Disney inheriting Star Wars and Marvel) with respect, care an understanding.

Unfortunately, it is clear that SOME PEOPLE cannot even exercise such basic human courtesy.

Seriously, REAL FANS only want the fictional works that they love to be enjoyable/fulfilling/sensible/true. The last time I checked, most SANE PEOPLE do not appreciate being mocked or treated unfairly when they have actual reasons to be upset about a fictional work being handled poorly (such as the ‘Disney Star Wars Sequels’).

1,"Random question that I thought of while having another discussion.  


In the Mortis Arc of Clone Wars, the characters encounter the planet Mortis with the Father, Son, and Daughter, powerful entities with tremendous command of the Force.  The Son being almost a personification/avatar of the Dark side and the Daughter of the Light side, while the Father seemed to be a balance of neutrality between the two, holding them in check.  


At the end of the arc, he is on his deathbed.  Having already spoken during the arc as if he was going to die, he is mortally wounded by the Son's machinations.  The main characters then find themselves back on their ship, their clocks prior to the time they landed on the planet, in empty space with no planet Mortis nor any evidence the events actually happened and weren't a dream or Force vision.  


It SHOULD be noted here that the imagery of the Father, Son, and Daughter seems to be ancient among at least some Force wielders, as artwork depicting the three was found on Lothal at an ancient Jedi temple, which eventually leads Ezra to the portal of ""the World between Worlds"".  The artwork was ancient, but prevalent enough (at least in ancient ruins) that Palpatine's historian recognized it and was able to describe it, even if admitting that the exact significance was unknown.  


Fast forward to Star Wars: Rebels and the founding of Chopper Base on Attolan.  There, former Jedi Padawan Kanan Jarus meets a large, nature-like being calling itself the Bendu, saying that there were the sides of the Force, such as the Light and the Dark, but ""I'm the one in the middle.  The Bendu.""  


He does not say ""those like me"" or ""my kind"" or anything that would suggest a general statement.  While he could be referring to a class or order of being, we've not seen nor encountered any others of his kind or his order or his...philosophy?...to make that determination.  


Like the Father, he seems to be some singular being, dedicated to a peaceful existence and balance between Light and Dark rather than using either.  To the point he refuses to take either side when Thrawn's Imperial forces assault the Rebels on the planet, and when called a coward by Kanan, proceeds to become a storm and attack both sides.  The only time he attacks only one side is when the Rebels flee after he demands everyone leave his planet, leaving only the Imperials for him to attack.  


After a barrage of fire from Thrawn's forces sends him crashing to the ground in corporeal form, he predicts Thrawn's future defeat (even after being unable to predict whether Ahsoka would die if she confronted Vader), and claims he is beyond Thrawn's ability to destroy when Thrawn asked what manner of being he was.  He then vanishes when Thrawn shoots at the Bendu's fallen form, only his laughter echoing, indicating he had not been killed.  


.  


While being arguably weaker than the Father outright, the Bendu was Force neutral, and described himself, like the Father, as a balance point between the two.  Like the Father, he was extremely wise, and had an air of immortality, or, at least, very extended life and a desire for peace and not engaging with petty or lesser or trifling matters like...you know, a major galaxy spanning civil war.  Like the Father, he did not seem entirely immortal, and had at once both a corporeal and ethereal seeming existence.  And like the Father, he seemed to be an enigmatic and singular being, an anomaly in the Universe, somewhat akin to the character of Tom Bombadil in the Lord of the Rings (Aule theories aside)  


Note that I'm not saying the Bendu WAS the Father or anything.  More asking the question if they could be...I dunno, ""of a type of thing"" or somehow connected, I guess?  Or, perhaps, that the Bendu could have been AN incarnation or corporeal branch of the Father or something.  


While we do know the Father was mortally wounded in the events on Mortis, as Mortis seemed somewhat removed from time, we don't really know how long his death would have taken, or even when it would have occurred in the outside universe (similarly to how events in Hyperspace are not exactly in sync with the normal/realspace Galaxy), so we do not know for certain if the Father would be dead by the events of Rebels, or if he was even killed at all, or any thing like that that would interfere with any potential connection with the Bendu.  


Anyway, just wondering if anyone might have a thought or answer to the question.  


Oh, one other thing of note: Apparently, an early name in the original Star Wars for the Jedi was the ""Jedi-Bendu"".  Take from that what you will.",Could the Bendu be some type of incarnation/reincarnation of the Father from Mortis?,random question that i thought of while having another discussion   in the mortis arc of clone wars  the characters encounter the planet mortis with the father  son  and daughter  powerful entities with tremendous command of the force   the son being almost a personification avatar of the dark side and the daughter of the light side  while the father seemed to be a balance of neutrality between the two  holding them in check   at the end of the arc  he is on his deathbed   having already spoken during the arc as if he was going to die  he is mortally wounded by the son s machinations   the main characters then find themselves back on their ship  their clocks prior to the time they landed on the planet  in empty space with no planet mortis nor any evidence the events actually happened and weren t a dream or force vision   it should be noted here that the imagery of the father  son  and daughter seems to be ancient among at least some force wielders  as artwork depicting the three was found on lothal at an ancient jedi temple  which eventually leads ezra to the portal of  the world between worlds    the artwork was ancient  but prevalent enough  at least in ancient ruins  that palpatine s historian recognized it and was able to describe it  even if admitting that the exact significance was unknown   fast forward to star wars  rebels and the founding of chopper base on attolan   there  former jedi padawan kanan jarus meets a large  nature like being calling itself the bendu  saying that there were the sides of the force  such as the light and the dark  but  i m the one in the middle   the bendu    he does not say  those like me  or  my kind  or anything that would suggest a general statement   while he could be referring to a class or order of being  we ve not seen nor encountered any others of his kind or his order or his   philosophy    to make that determination   like the father  he seems to be some singular being  dedicated to a peaceful existence and balance between light and dark rather than using either   to the point he refuses to take either side when thrawn s imperial forces assault the rebels on the planet  and when called a coward by kanan  proceeds to become a storm and attack both sides   the only time he attacks only one side is when the rebels flee after he demands everyone leave his planet  leaving only the imperials for him to attack   after a barrage of fire from thrawn s forces sends him crashing to the ground in corporeal form  he predicts thrawn s future defeat  even after being unable to predict whether ahsoka would die if she confronted vader   and claims he is beyond thrawn s ability to destroy when thrawn asked what manner of being he was   he then vanishes when thrawn shoots at the bendu s fallen form  only his laughter echoing  indicating he had not been killed      while being arguably weaker than the father outright  the bendu was force neutral  and described himself  like the father  as a balance point between the two   like the father  he was extremely wise  and had an air of immortality  or  at least  very extended life and a desire for peace and not engaging with petty or lesser or trifling matters like   you know  a major galaxy spanning civil war   like the father  he did not seem entirely immortal  and had at once both a corporeal and ethereal seeming existence   and like the father  he seemed to be an enigmatic and singular being  an anomaly in the universe  somewhat akin to the character of tom bombadil in the lord of the rings  aule theories aside   note that i m not saying the bendu was the father or anything   more asking the question if they could be   i dunno   of a type of thing  or somehow connected  i guess   or  perhaps  that the bendu could have been an incarnation or corporeal branch of the father or something   while we do know the father was mortally wounded in the events on mortis  as mortis seemed somewhat  from time  we don t really know how long his death would have taken  or even when it would have occurred in the outside universe  similarly to how events in hyperspace are not exactly in sync with the normal realspace galaxy   so we do not know for certain if the father would be dead by the events of rebels  or if he was even killed at all  or any thing like that that would interfere with any potential connection with the bendu   anyway  just wondering if anyone might have a thought or answer to the question   oh  one other thing of note  apparently  an early name in the original star wars for the jedi was the  jedi bendu    take from that what you will could the bendu be some type of incarnation reincarnation of the father from mortis

I love all the Star Wars movies (and books, games, toys, etc.) but it feels like it’s impossible to enjoy the franchise anymore. Every time I log onto a Star Wars themed subreddit, the very first thing I see is how dumb half the fandom is. 

I used to love interacting with this fandom. I’ve earned upvotes from seemingly every subreddit: /r/StarWars, /r/Prequelmemes, /r/SequelMemes, /r/TheMandalorianTV, /r/GalaxysEdge, and even /r/SaltierThanCrait and /r/SaltierThanKrayt (yes, both).

But Reddit isn’t a place for sharing praise and criticism now. What happened to the Star Wars fandom? Whereas we once discussed a shared love for the series, today it seems like fandom is just a constant competition among the fans to show who can hate certain movies most vocally. 

Rock bottom was when I’ve seen the mental health of Sequels fans get attacked by other fans.

Can we just... try to like what each other likes? Not just keep ourselves to our subreddits in echo-chambers, but try to share each other’s likings?

 Can’t the OT diehards start to enjoy Prequel lore?

Can’t the Prequel memers try to enjoy the acting of the Sequel actors and actresses?

Can’t we all just enjoy The Mandalorian without attacking each other?

1,"I forget the name of the movie but the 2nd one of the new star wars is the best or the most interesting from a twists and turns defying convention point of view. The amount of things that can be analyzed is intense. For example in the final fight scene one of the red guys is about to stab the main character and in the next frame the knife suddenly just vanishes. Them choosing not the do a re shoot of this scene leads me to believe that maybe this is one of Rays new force powers and instead of holding the audiences hand in terms of explaining things they just let it happen and leave it open to interpretation. I have seen HEMA people claim the choreography is bad but I think they miss the point of the movie. They even show the Luke to be a weak coward which subverts expectations so heavily from the originals that  I never saw it coming. One word, zany. Another crazy unusual choice was the slow motion version of a chase scene. The ships following one another was like watching a car chase but slowed down and turned into the main plot. Not something I expected. For one you think of well they can just launch some smaller faster ships or use long ranged weapons but then they don't and pay the price when the girl from blue velvet who is now purple turns into pure energy and becomes even more powerful than the jedi and sith combined. Then you think that the Luke will have this awesome showdown but theres a twist and he is actually a ghost before he even dies and then after that he dies. Then there is a part where the director took some strong influences from Marry Poppins and has Layer the main character fly through space using the force to survive which feels like it belongs in a different movie. Scenes like this can be hilarious but I found a lot of the humor to be a lot less slapstick and more plot based, for example how they humorously mock the genre by pretending theres things like gravity in space. Massive departure from the play it safe first episode. I left the movie feeling like the same people did not even make the first and second movies which I know would be insane. While I would say I enjoyed it I will probably not watch the next movie because I am happy with where the story ended. Overall feel pretty satisfied with the villain defeated and the conclusion to Rays story. My only mark against it though is I think younger audiences will have trouble with a lot of what exactly makes it so funny and good. I would like to know where the knife that was about to stab Layer during the red room fight scene went though. Maybe this will be explained in the Persondolorian series.",Been obsessed with Episode two and it is now my favorite Star Wars,i forget the name of the movie but the 2nd one of the new star wars is the best or the most interesting from a twists and turns defying convention point of view  the amount of things that can be analyzed is intense  for example in the final fight scene one of the red guys is about to stab the main character and in the next frame the knife suddenly just vanishes  them choosing not the do a re shoot of this scene leads me to believe that maybe this is one of rays new force powers and instead of holding the audiences hand in terms of explaining things they just let it happen and leave it open to interpretation  i have seen hema people claim the choreography is bad but i think they miss the point of the movie  they even show the luke to be a weak coward which subverts expectations so heavily from the originals that  i never saw it coming  one word  zany  another crazy unusual choice was the slow motion version of a chase scene  the ships following one another was like watching a car chase but slowed down and turned into the main plot  not something i expected  for one you think of well they can just launch some smaller faster ships or use long ranged weapons but then they don t and pay the price when the girl from blue velvet who is now purple turns into pure energy and becomes even more powerful than the jedi and sith combined  then you think that the luke will have this awesome showdown but theres a twist and he is actually a ghost before he even dies and then after that he dies  then there is a part where the director took some strong influences from marry poppins and has layer the main character fly through space using the force to survive which feels like it belongs in a different movie  scenes like this can be hilarious but i found a lot of the humor to be a lot less slapstick and more plot based  for example how they humorously mock the genre by pretending theres things like gravity in space  massive departure from the play it safe first episode  i left the movie feeling like the same people did not even make the first and second movies which i know would be insane  while i would say i enjoyed it i will probably not watch the next movie because i am happy with where the story ended  overall feel pretty satisfied with the villain defeated and the conclusion to rays story  my only mark against it though is i think younger audiences will have trouble with a lot of what exactly makes it so funny and good  i would like to know where the knife that was about to stab layer during the red room fight scene went though  maybe this will be explained in the persondolorian series been obsessed with episode two and it is now my favorite star wars

Since jedi were the only threat to palpatine wouldn't other sith be aswell? After all sith aren't above killing other sith as everyone knows especially to gain power. In fact while the inquisitor program was formed in order to hunt down jedi survivors of order 66. While inquisitors were force users vader and sidious made sure not to give them any training in ways of the sith for fear that the inquistors would become too powerful and might even attempted to overthrow them both.

Now, I personally hate Kathleen Kennedy for ruining Star Wars. She thought Rogue One was boring, that's an example of being stupid and not having good taste.

1,"I just finished the second season of the Mandalorian. While the show was a lot of fun and the introductions of old characters were awesome, all of the fights just seem so boring and cheesy to me. 

I know it’s Star Wars. I know this isn’t some grade A action movie with the highest trained military in film history, but can we do a little bit better?

Watching the OT, it was laughable how bad the storm troopers aim was. It’s fun to look back on it because it’s an older movie and with older movies comes things such as that. 

But aren’t we at the point where things can get a little more interesting? I’m so sick of seeing every single bullet miss the heroes. I’m sick of these troopers just stumbling along, not using any type of formation or tactics whatsoever. You have a galactic empire that can rule the galaxy but can’t devote a little time to military tactics?

Mandalorian spoiler ahead: 

I knew Luke was going to show up in this final episode and I was really excited to see him slaughter through these black droids. You know, these droids who seemed unstoppable and a single one almost took down the undefeated Mando. Yet when Luke faced them, not only did he slaughter them, he pretty much did it in slow motion. It’s just so cheesy and lame. 

I know a lot of people don’t like the prequels but this is what I miss most about them. I miss that field of Jedis surrounded by thousands of droids, swiping away shot after shot in a matter of seconds. At that point it at least seemed like they were ridiculously skilled and not that the enemies were just damn morons.

I know Star Wars is a casual viewing experience when it comes to this aspect I’m discussing, I just wish it could improve. Doing so in this series would have put a nice touch on it","Are we ever going to get smart, skilled enemy soldiers in a Star Wars movie/series?",i just finished the second season of the mandalorian  while the show was a lot of fun and the introductions of old characters were awesome  all of the fights just seem so boring and cheesy to me  i know it s star wars  i know this isn t some grade a action movie with the highest trained military in film history  but can we do a little bit better watching the ot  it was laughable how bad the storm troopers aim was  it s fun to look back on it because it s an older movie and with older movies comes things such as that  but aren t we at the point where things can get a little more interesting  i m so sick of seeing every single bullet miss the heroes  i m sick of these troopers just stumbling along  not using any type of formation or tactics whatsoever  you have a galactic empire that can rule the galaxy but can t devote a little time to military tactics mandalorian spoiler ahead  i knew luke was going to show up in this final episode and i was really excited to see him slaughter through these black droids  you know  these droids who seemed unstoppable and a single one almost took down the undefeated mando  yet when luke faced them  not only did he slaughter them  he pretty much did it in slow motion  it s just so cheesy and lame  i know a lot of people don t like the prequels but this is what i miss most about them  i miss that field of jedis surrounded by thousands of droids  swiping away shot after shot in a matter of seconds  at that point it at least seemed like they were ridiculously skilled and not that the enemies were just damn morons i know star wars is a casual viewing experience when it comes to this aspect i m discussing  i just wish it could improve  doing so in this series would have put a nice touch on itare we ever going to get smart  skilled enemy soldiers in a star wars movie series

1,"I know a lot of people thought/wanted Snoke was going to be Plagueis or some other ancient Sith. However, I think that him being unimportant to the overall narrative of the sequels is actually really smart. I think if you had Snoke be an ancient Sith it would bring too many negatives than positives, both within the narrative and the random. Narratively I think Kylo completing his training is something that had to be done and is something that made him grown as a dark side user. The act of the apprentice killing the master is essential in the rule of 2. I think if you had Snoke be Plagueis it would have made a lot of the community mad that the new characters beat such a strong opponent who was able to go under the radar of Sidious and Vader. Going and moving on to what I just appreciate about the use of snoke in TLJ is his design. He is literally dressed and robed in gold.

Lukes quest to setup a new jedi academy, hunting sith artefacts, and training Leia. The rise of the New republic. The sith worshippers' quest to kill Palpatine's children, and bring him back to life. And most importantly, the corruption of Ben solo, his ascension to the Knights of Ren, and as Snoke's apprentice. Whenever I rewatch the ST these events always stick in my mind because I think that we could've, and still can get great story from them in cinema. Although Carrie Fisher's passing, and Harrison Ford's departure may make this fruitless.

1,"I’ve been forced to re-watch the sequel trilogy with my family and just finished the last Jedi and I have a few problems with its while chase dynamic. throughout the entire movie I couldn’t help but wonder why the first order doesn’t just deploy all of their fighters both at the very beginning or after the resistance jumps away the first time or why they didn’t  bring any support ships with them when they went to chase down the resistance or engage them in the fist place, instead opting to bring in some sort of battle cruiser (though it’s called a dreadnought and I’m not sure why I thought those were smaller anti fighter corvette type things) completely unsupported with no smaller ships to support it and then immediately after losing your main capital ship due to a lack of support bring in an even bigger SSD with your SUPREME LEADER on it and still no support of any kind other then a few star destroyers witch have abysmal anti fighter capabilities. Then they just sit there and throw shots at the Resistance hoping to eventually break the shields on Mon Cala ships no less. My other issue lies with the other faction the great resistance who just sit there and wait to die though there isn’t any other option really decide to elect to command admiral Holdo who is a terrible leader spreading false hope and refusing to share her plan with anyone leading to a mutiny costing the resistance even more people and equipment 
On a similar note about the resistance why do they use those huge slow and clunky bombers instead of the tried and true b-wings and y-wings which are much faster and arguably better. 

TL;DR The resistance and the First Order have no idea of how naval combat works

1,"I would genuinely like to know in depth and with reason, why as a fan you enjoy these movies? Personally, I think they are not only cinematic failures , but just straight trash can Star Wars films or storytelling if you will.

My list is long , but to be succinct for discussions sakes, my biggest problems are:

Shitty character development. Honestly don’t give 2 shits about any of the newer characters. Rey and Ben have potential but are executed poorly. 

They insulted the legacy of previous characters we all loved.

What they did to Luke is unforgivable and not anything I believe we’d expect from Luke

Bringing back palptine( especially with no damn good explanation) was just lame.

The plot holes, the obvious lack of story consistency or a outline for how it should go.

Side characters were terrible. NO, it has nothing to do with Kelly Marie Tran being an Asian woman or any of that shit. Personally I love all the actors, she seems sweet as hell, daisy is a gem, domhall and Oscar Isaac are great actors, Adam driver is awesome. I literally have no issue with the actors, their characters however, are weak and poorly written. I could easily keep going, but I want to hear WHY I’m wrong or looking at it wrong.

Ok so probably bonkers theory BUT as we saw in the finale of Mando S2 Din gives Grogu off to Luke to be properly trained in the ways of the force.

So, thematically as Mando gave Luke his “son” for safekeeping I wonder if maybe Mando S4 or some future finale episode see’s an older Luke (maybe 15 ABY) giving his child to Mando to keep safe from the growing threat he feels on the horizon (Ben/Stoke/Sideous).

Yes I know there’s no mention of any child in the ST but let’s be honest the backstories of anything BEFORE TFA were brief, glossed over and contradictory at best.

I could totally see Filoni and Faverau doing Mara Jade at some point and also bringing in some version of Ben Skywalker from Legends (Anakin Skywalker II in this version). 

So in my wild bonkers theory we see this future point at the end of the Mando story when Din is older and thinks his adventures are maybe over when he’s contacted by Luke. Meeting him in secret Luke says something like “*As you once entrusted me with your precious child I must now ask you to do the same for me. Keep him safe, keep him from harm, and above keep him away from the Dark Side”*

The scene then ends in a parallel to S2 finale with Old Man Mando with Grogu by his side and a young child asleep in his arms.


This is basically because I think it would thematically be a nice touch but also I really wanted the Skywalker line to continue through Luke like in legends, and this seems the only plausible way to do it to line up with the ST.

I’ve decided that I’m going to design myself a Star Wars Tarot Deck. For now I’m only going to be making the Major arcana but I thought I’d share my ideas for who/what I’m thinking about representing each card and get some feedback about my choices :) 
I’ve decided to base my choices on the meanings behind the card rather than just going off the name. (I also haven’t decided if I’m going to change the names of the cards or just stick with the traditional names 
So... 

1. The Magician = Ahsoka - Sudden solution, surpassing the plausible 


2. High Priestess = Rey - Secrets and hidden circumstances 


3. The Empress = Leia Organa - Gentle power, rarely opposed 


4. The Emperor = Kylo Ren - Yield or suffer, up against real power 


5. The Hierophant = Qui Gon Jin - Spiritual authority, approval from elevated dignity
 

6. The Lovers = Anakin and Padme - Intense affection 


7. The Chariot = Millennium Falcon - Triumph, success in spite of resistance 


8. Strength = Luke Skywalker - Superior, a great feat, hero 


9. The Hermit = Yoda - Lesson/reward, solitude, isolation 


10. Wheel of Fortune = Han Solo - Uncertain outcome, unpredictable 


11. Justice = Mace Windu - Rule of law, justice


12. The Hanged Man = Obi-Wan Kenobi - Great personal sacrifice, sacrifice 


13. Death = Darth Vader - Costly loss, coming to an end 


14. Temperance = R2D2 - Moderation, passing of time, patience 


15. The Devil = Palpatine/Sideous - Giving into temptation, nemesis 


16. The Tower = The Jedi Temple - Spectacular ambition ending in disaster, destruction, failure 


17. The Star = The Father - Pause and reflect, distance, unreachable 


18. The Moon = The Daughter - Longing, hope of fulfilment 


19. The Sun = The Son - ability, triumph, great resources 


20. Judgement = Force Ghosts (Ben Kenobi, Yoda &amp; Anakin) - ultimate judgement, result, final outcome 


21. The World = The World between Worlds - Success but not for free, opportunity

1,"What are your thoughts on Mace Windu taking up that role? Do you guys think this would be milking the characters too much?

I'm a Kenobi fan, and have read a good amount of books in the EU. I enjoyed the  A'Sharad Hett/Darth Krayt spinoff. It makes sense, a Jedi who survives Order 66 goes home. He has a hatred for Anakin and wants to kill Anakin's son and turns to the dark side. [https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth\_Krayt](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Krayt)

However, I think Disney has done away with the EU and wouldn't fall specifically on that storyline. 

Here are some reasons why I think an epic battle between Windu and Kenobi could work:

 

\-There are a handful of people in the galaxy who can challenge Kenobi, and Windu is one of them. To me, it seems even more uncreative to whip out a superpowerful being out of thin air. At best Kenobi, is top 5 in the galaxy (Yoda, Windu, Anakin, Palpatine, Vader) At worst, he was a master on the Jedi council. Either way, Kenobi is definitely a top gun in the galaxy.

\-Windu doesn't have to be an official ""Darth"". Windu can be a Jedi who turned dark and is therefore a Sith.

\-Depending on how they do it, I would be okay with survival. Darth Maul was able to survive getting cut in half with his hate for Kenobi, Palpatine was able to survive being blown up in the Death Star. Windu was a master of form 7/Vaapad, so I could see one unexpected betrayal could have tilted him to hatred and keep him alive. 

\-Maul turned out to be a reasonable character in Clone Wars and I want to see more of Windu, so I wouldn't be too upset if he avoided death. Maul was fueled by hatred/revenge, so Windu could be too. Windu was more powerful than Maul and a top force user, so he could have survived the force lightning (Yoda got up and fought after a weaker shock).  Terminal velocity/drop trauma would be blocked by the force.

\-Dooku was a top Jedi Master who turned dark, so I don't think it would be unreasonable for Windu to also, especially after being betrayed.

\-This sort of plot would allow him to stay low, out of the eyes of the Empire. Or maybe Kenobi somehow lays an elaborate trap and it's a Windu vs Vader finale. Vader will be in Jedi hunting mode around this time anyways.

\-In the Mandolorian, it is a regular person in armor, so ordinary obstacles are okay, but in Kenobi, the villain has to be very powerful. 

Extra Details:

\- A TV show probably won't get into the weeds of lightsaber styles etc, but on a more detailed side, Obi-wan's style 3 Could be a great defense against Windu's shatter point/Vaapad. Grevious's attack style was a sort of Vaapad in its own way where it could find all the holes in the enemies. Idk if it is canon, but Grevious killed a Jedi master in 1v1 in 20 seconds. ([https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Waldan\_Bridger](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Waldan_Bridger)) 

\- If there is no attack/anger to redirect, Windu would have to approach it differently than Vaapad (given, he is a master of all the styles its not a big deal). In theory, if there are no weaknesses, then shatter point won't help. In the ROTS book Windu says, 

""But surely, Master Windu,"" Obi-Wan had said, ""you, with the power of Vaapad-or Yoda's mastery of Ataru-"" Mace Windu had almost smiled. **""I created Vaapad to answer my weakness: it channels my own darkness into a weapon of the light. Master Yoda's Ataru is also an answer to weakness: the limitations of reach and mobility imposed by his stature and his age. But for you? What weakness does Soresu answer?""** Blinking, Obi-Wan had been forced to admit he'd never actually thought of it that way. ""That is so like you, Master Kenobi,"" the Korun Master had said, shaking his head. ""I am called a great swordsman because I invented a lethal style; but who is greater, the creator of a killing form or the master of the classic form?"" - ROTS Book

\-For people who think, Windu would stomp Kenobi, maybe Kenoni has mastered his connection with the Krayt Dragon and will just tell it to eat Windu.

Sorry if the thoughts are all over the place, I wanted to see what you guys thought.",Thoughts on Mace Windu appearing in Kenobi in an A'Sharad Hett style spinoff?,what are your thoughts on mace windu taking up that role  do you guys think this would be milking the characters too much i m a kenobi fan  and have read a good amount of books in the eu  i enjoyed the  a sharad hett darth krayt spinoff  it makes sense  a jedi who survives order 66 goes home  he has a hatred for anakin and wants to kill anakin s son and turns to the dark side   however  i think disney has done away with the eu and wouldn t fall specifically on that storyline  here are some reasons why i think an epic battle between windu and kenobi could work    there are a handful of people in the galaxy who can challenge kenobi  and windu is one of them  to me  it seems even more uncreative to whip out a superpowerful being out of thin air  at best kenobi  is top 5 in the galaxy  yoda  windu  anakin  palpatine  vader  at worst  he was a master on the jedi council  either way  kenobi is definitely a top gun in the galaxy   windu doesn t have to be an official  darth   windu can be a jedi who turned dark and is therefore a sith   depending on how they do it  i would be okay with survival  darth maul was able to survive getting cut in half with his hate for kenobi  palpatine was able to survive being blown up in the death star  windu was a master of form 7 vaapad  so i could see one unexpected betrayal could have tilted him to hatred and keep him alive    maul turned out to be a reasonable character in clone wars and i want to see more of windu  so i wouldn t be too upset if he avoided death  maul was fueled by hatred revenge  so windu could be too  windu was more powerful than maul and a top force user  so he could have survived the force lightning  yoda got up and fought after a weaker shock    terminal velocity drop trauma would be blocked by the force   dooku was a top jedi master who turned dark  so i don t think it would be unreasonable for windu to also  especially after being betrayed   this sort of plot would allow him to stay low  out of the eyes of the empire  or maybe kenobi somehow lays an elaborate trap and it s a windu vs vader finale  vader will be in jedi hunting mode around this time anyways   in the mandolorian  it is a regular person in armor  so ordinary obstacles are okay  but in kenobi  the villain has to be very powerful  extra details    a tv show probably won t get into the weeds of lightsaber styles etc  but on a more detailed side  obi wan s style 3 could be a great defense against windu s shatter point vaapad  grevious s attack style was a sort of vaapad in its own way where it could find all the holes in the enemies  idk if it is canon  but grevious killed a jedi master in 1v1 in 20 seconds        if there is no attack anger to redirect  windu would have to approach it differently than vaapad  given  he is a master of all the styles its not a big deal   in theory  if there are no weaknesses  then shatter point won t help  in the rots book windu says   but surely  master windu   obi wan had said   you  with the power of vaapad or yoda s mastery of ataru   mace windu had almost smiled     i created vaapad to answer my weakness  it channels my own darkness into a weapon of the light  master yoda s ataru is also an answer to weakness  the limitations of reach and mobility imposed by his stature and his age  but for you  what weakness does soresu answer     blinking  obi wan had been forced to admit he d never actually thought of it that way   that is so like you  master kenobi   the korun master had said  shaking his head   i am called a great swordsman because i invented a lethal style  but who is greater  the creator of a killing form or the master of the classic form     rots book  for people who think  windu would stomp kenobi  maybe kenoni has mastered his connection with the krayt dragon and will just tell it to eat windu ps  i just realized darth krayt is named after the krayt dragon  amp  x200b sorry if the thoughts are all over the place  i wanted to see what you guys thought thoughts on mace windu appearing in kenobi in an a sharad hett style spinoff

Durge knows many ways to kill Mandalorians and the Darksaber has to be the key to push them to the cliff before they face mass extinction.

Even as a pretender to the throne can Mandalorians be put under fear to the point Durge would swiftly execute them in a slight breeze.

Maybe the Mandalorians can change their minds after all of this and accept the new ways that Din, Jango, and Boba went through.

After all Durge would put all Mandalorians and Pseudo Mandalorians unite together to defeat a common threat in order to dethrone him to pave way towards a new era. 

I bet S3 will feature the Imperials as a lesser threat as if they were to hire Durge, he will pretty much steal the show since his ties to his hatred for the Mandalorians makes it a focal point overshadowing the Imperials.

Or if Durge doesn't make it, an Expy can taking all of his traits and Project Durge making it the Durge of Disneyverse.

1,"Alright, so I watched the originals and the prequels when I was so young I did not truly understand what was going on in these movies. Now I've decided to watch the movies again, and there have been a few questions I have been asking myself that come from all the Star Wars talks I've read over the years, so here goes. Btw if these questions have already been answered, I am sorry, and feel free to remove my thread, I'll get my answers some other way!

1. Why do the prequels get so much hate? I know people talked a lot about the conversations Anakin has with Padme as being bad or stuff, but what I see is a 19 Years Old boy who was originally very close to his emotions (in Episode 1 with his mother, he was always a very empathic and loving child), who then got told to repress his emotions the become a Jedi, by being trained by Obi-Wan who was actually training him because of his emotions for his late master, from what I have been seeing, Obi-Wan is terrible at controlling his emotions as soon as Anakin or his master is involved. He also keeps talking about how he ""hates"" things. Also, Anakin shows a very high respect for Senator Palpatine, who keeps telling him that he will become stronger by embracing his emotions. These emotions are clearly shown when he meets padme again, and for a kid who never had any dating advice or experience, it makes sense that he looks like a real fool speaking to the love of his life. 

2. I might be wrong here, but aren't the jedi masters a bit hypocritical (and is maybe one of the things that were supposed to be understood but I just now understand), Luke was a very emotional person, but had a clear mind and could stay calm in moments he needed, which helped him control his powers, but his emotions actually made his powers much stronger? Yoda is another with whom I noticed this, in EP5 when he is training Luke, he keeps arguing with Obi-Wan, and keeps dodging Lukes questions, which makes me feel like he is experiencing sadness/fear but tries to repress it infront of Luke, but the fact that he does have those emotions and lives them makes me think that is why he is such a powerful jedi. This would mean that they are purposefully training sub-par jedis because of their fear of having people get angry and realize how powerful those emotions are, but if they could use their love and empathy instead they could be far more stronger all while staying attuned to the light side?

3. Why were people upset about the message heard from Emporia Palpatine in the new episodes being something that happened in Fortnite and not any official sources? The beginning introductions in all the movies seemed to talk about bits that did not make it in the official star wars media, so why was that one such a controversy?

4. Is there any easy to access shows/books or anything else that goes more into side stories such as the mandalorian? Heard there was a Yoda Ark in the Clone Wars series, is there anything else like that?

I have a few more, but my lack of remembering character names makes it difficult for me to ask them, and might make this thread too long of a read to get the answers I truly want.

1. Sheev Palpatine is the most ingenious state-crafter I have ever seen! For example, his investment into an obedient clone and droid army to start off his influence then to win the support of many human to be recruited across the Galaxy is a great way to secure the loyalty of his State security apparatus.

Canon and Legends provide numerous examples of his cunning and brilliance:

* [Why Did Palpatine](https://youtu.be/mv4LlogsG_Y)[ Kill His Master Who Brought Him to Power?](https://youtu.be/mv4LlogsG_Y)

1,"Here’s my personal pitch for a Luke Skywalker series on Disney+

The series begins shortly after The Mandalorian season 2, Luke has just begun training Grogu as his apprentice, although Luke won’t start his Jedi academy for another 6 years in 15 ABY (which allows this show to run for 5-6 seasons) Luke, Grogu and R2-D2 are traveling around the galaxy learning the history and culture of the Jedi, we see Luke gather the 8 sacred Jedi texts seen in the sequel trilogy and learn more about what’s in them. We can even show the first meeting between Luke and Lor San Tekka, hell, maybe even bring in Ashoka for an episode. Luke is being guided on this long journey by Anakin’s and Yoda’s force ghost, I’d love to see a meeting between Yoda and Grogu. 

The first antagonist of the series would be Mara Jade,  let me explain, in this timeline Mara Jade would have been a secret apprentice to the emperor, not even Vader knew, kinda like Starkiller in a way. She was trained to either avenge his and Vader’s death or become a replacement for Vader should he die, although the Emperor didn’t prefer her over Luke. She’s out for revenge against Luke for supposedly killing the Emperor and Vader, eventually she turns to the light side and becomes a Jedi. Since this show would run for 5-6 seasons we would have plenty of time for this character development. Her and Luke can get married or stay separated, it’s complicated, maybe they did get married but she died in the fire, or maybe they stay separate, let me hear your ideas on this subject.

The series would end with Luke (and maybe Mara Jade) establishing a new Jedi academy, we can even feature a young Ben Solo, a de-aged Han and Leia, and Chewbacca at the opening of the academy.",My pitch for a Luke series.,here s my personal pitch for a luke skywalker series on disney the series begins shortly after the mandalorian season 2  luke has just begun training grogu as his apprentice  although luke won t start his jedi academy for another 6 years in 15 aby  which allows this show to run for 5 6 seasons  luke  grogu and r2 d2 are traveling around the galaxy learning the history and culture of the jedi  we see luke gather the 8 sacred jedi texts seen in the sequel trilogy and learn more about what s in them  we can even show the first meeting between luke and lor san tekka  hell  maybe even bring in ashoka for an episode  luke is being guided on this long journey by anakin s and yoda s force ghost  i d love to see a meeting between yoda and grogu  the first antagonist of the series would be mara jade   let me explain  in this timeline mara jade would have been a secret apprentice to the emperor  not even vader knew  kinda like starkiller in a way  she was trained to either avenge his and vader s death or become a replacement for vader should he die  although the emperor didn t prefer her over luke  she s out for revenge against luke for supposedly killing the emperor and vader  eventually she turns to the light side and becomes a jedi  since this show would run for 5 6 seasons we would have plenty of time for this character development  her and luke can get married or stay separated  it s complicated  maybe they did get married but she died in the fire  or maybe they stay separate  let me hear your ideas on this subject the series would end with luke  and maybe mara jade  establishing a new jedi academy  we can even feature a young ben solo  a de aged han and leia  and chewbacca at the opening of the academy my pitch for a luke series

1,"I love the title of RoTS and Palpatines scheming and plotting. Best parts of the saga. Sometimes I thought “revenge for what?” What could the jedi have done that was so bad that they would plot revenge for 1000 years. Then I read the Darth bane books and some others that touch on the great Jedi schism but now that they are no longer canon I kind of hope that in the high republic they actually show that the Sith weren’t always evil. What if instead they started out good and that the dark side wasn’t inherently evil. Then something happened that forced the Jedi to commit an atrocity so horrible that it turned the Sith into the dark lords we know today.

I read and collected books leading up to about 2010-11. At that time, I had read close to 75% of the material set after episode VI and about 50% of the material set pre episode I. I tried to get into a couple novels right after episode VII came out but I didn't care for them (it's been so long so idk what they were anymore). 

However, the Mandalorian season 2 and the Clone Wars finale has whet my appetite for all things Star Wars and given me a new hope for the new canon, but I'm not sure where to start since I have been out the loop so long. What are the best novels in this new canon? Preferably set post episode III or pre episode I, but I will take any recommendations if the book is good.

Timothy Zahn (everything Thrawn), Kevin J.

**Layer 1**

The quote from Julius Caesar: 

&gt;We at the height are ready to decline.


&gt;There is a tide in the affairs of men


&gt;Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;


&gt;Omitted, all the voyage of their life


&gt;Is bound in shallows and in miseries.


&gt;On such a full sea are we now afloat,


&gt;And we must take the current when it serves,


&gt;Or lose our ventures. (IV.ii.269–276)

[An excerpt of the explanation at literarydevices.net](https://literarydevices.net/there-is-a-tide-in-the-affairs-of-men/):

""In our lives, we get ebbs and flows; however, we sometimes are unable to recognize whether the tide is an opportunity or an obstacle. It is up to us to avail ourselves of an opportunity or a warning sign.""

&gt;!I read that as a reference to the lack of clarity around whether Osyraa's desire to negotiate is an opportunity or a warning sign and the lack of certainty on whether Vance and Osyraa will avail themselves of the opportunity/warning.!&lt;

**Layer 2**

&gt;!Read out loud, the title is ""There is a Tide DOT DOT DOT""

That's a reference to the 3 DOT23s that show up at the end of the episode to help the bridge officers.!&lt;

**Layer 3**

&gt;!DOT DOT DOT as in morse code which is featured heavily in the scene where the bridge officers take down the regulators.!&lt;

**Bonus Layer**

Note that when they first revealed the episode titles from this season, this episode was named 'The Good of the People'. That's probably a reference to a quote by Marcus Tullius Cicero:

&gt;Salus populi suprema lex esto

Which is popularly translated as:

&gt;""The good of the people is the greatest law."" 

*[Other translations of the latin, source and explanation here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salus_populi_suprema_lex_esto)*

&gt;!I personally read that as a reference to what is at stake in the negotiation. While Vance and Osyraa negotiate, they *should* be paying attention to the ""greatest law"" i.e. ""the good of the people"".!&lt;

Responding to a [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/7aobgs/counselor_troi_useless/)

Clearly some fans may treat her as useless, and some are even more disparaging. Feminists at the time despised her, even the writers struggled to realise her usefulness but Troi is not just a pretty face, if there was a character usefulness tier list from Picard's perspective, Troi would probably be at the top. 

Troi, whilst functioning as a councillor has managed to resolve a number of serious internal and external conflicts, providing insights not only into the entire crews emotional states as a collective during crises but also some of the thoughts and deceptions of enemies standing on different ships. She was able to communicate the distress of Riva when he lost his trio. She was also instrumental at forewarning the Captain as to the nature and intent of several extremely high risk, deity level threats such as Nigilum (It's treating us like lab rats, leading Picard to self-destruct the ship) and Q's immense intellect (before the encounter proper), without them being aware of her doing so.  She also helped Doctor Pulaski saved Riker's life by sensing Riker's dreams, later on obtains command qualifications. She is not just a crewman, she is another sensor added to the ship that can detect emotional intelligence and looked at as a sensor she fundamentally  aligns with the goal ""to seek out new life and civilisations"" but as a crewmember who counsels others and has the captains ear, she links the aloof captain to his staff without him needing to be there at all times.  In short, her presence nullifies Picard's only weakness, his reluctance to engage with the bridge staff in a personal manner.",Re: Troi is useless?,having re watched star trek tng  it is becoming clear that there is a tier list of characters from the fans perspective won t match the captain s perspective responding to a  previous thread  clearly some fans may treat her as useless  and some are even more disparaging  feminists at the time despised her  even the writers struggled to realise her usefulness but troi is not just a pretty face  if there was a character usefulness tier list from picard s perspective  troi would probably be at the top  troi  whilst functioning as a councillor has managed to resolve a number of serious internal and external conflicts  providing insights not only into the entire crews emotional states as a collective during crises but also some of the thoughts and deceptions of enemies standing on different ships  she was able to communicate the distress of riva when he lost his trio  she was also instrumental at forewarning the captain as to the nature and intent of several extremely high risk  deity level threats such as nigilum  it s treating us like lab rats  leading picard to self destruct the ship  and q s immense intellect  before the encounter proper   without them being aware of her doing so   she also helped doctor pulaski saved riker s life by sensing riker s dreams  later on obtains command qualifications  she is not just a crewman  she is another sensor added to the ship that can detect emotional intelligence and looked at as a sensor she fundamentally  aligns with the goal  to seek out new life and civilisations  but as a crewmember who counsels others and has the captains ear  she links the aloof captain to his staff without him needing to be there at all times   in short  her presence nullifies picard s only weakness  his reluctance to engage with the bridge staff in a personal manner re  troi is useless

They only have a few minutes left and one guy is turning on his lighter because if they are dying they can do it in a nice atmosphere I suppose... That is consuming even more of the little air they have left and they find out there is a ship nearby but they don't have enough air to wait until it gets close enough to save them.

0,"Discovery did its usual in randomly stumble upon the germ of a good idea without properly setting it up. The Emerald chain being a capitalist conglomerate of Worlds rather then the Orion Syndicate knock off they seemed, is on the face of it an interesting turn of events. But they've left it so late in the day they've left themselves no time to explore it before they move onto the next thing. 


The following is a thought experiment on how I'd of laid the season out . 

TL;DR version If you don't care to read the rest:   First 4 episodes deal with Burnham and Discovery turning up in the 31st century and establish the status quo between the Federation and the Emerald chain. The middle 4 mix stand alone with tge serialised elements of Michael trying to solve the mystery of the Burn . The final 5 would resolve the mystery of the Burn and culminate with a rejigged version of Osyraas plan to gain an audience with the Admiral and make her proposal.  

Episode 1:
- We open with Micheal working for an organisation called the Emerald chain under Osyraa. 
- secretly she's trying to use its resources to find Discovery.
- episode will establishing the galactic Status quo generally and the chains perspective on the burn and the federations and its failures specifically.
- The episode would end with them arriving over a pre warp world the chains plans first contacts with only to find a Federation ship already in Orbit.  Red alert. 

Episode 2 :  
- Would see the Discovery crash land on said pre warp planet 24 hours before.
-  they Send out a sos on federation channels and race against time to repair and free the ship before the planets pre warp inhabitants reach them. 
- Episode ends with a Federation ship arriving in orbit.

Episode 3 : 
- Both ships lock weapons on eachother and demand to know what the other is doing there. The chain accuse the Federation of hypocrisy for attempting to contact a pre warp civilization after all their high minded rhetoric. 
- The Federation Captain accuses the Chain of only being their to exploit the world for its resources. Osyraa responds saying they don't exploit they strike deals, our tech for their resources.  Besides ,you don't get to dictate how we survive the scarcity you helped cause. 
- Sensing high technology on the surface , Osyraa transports Michael down to investigate with a security officer,  they reach Discovery,  the security guard is shocked to discover the crew know Michael,  she turns her weapon on him and takes him prisoner . 
- After a lot of hugging Saru tells Michael to go help stamets get the spore drive working . Back up in orbit the two captains play for time rattling their sabres . 
- The federations ships long range sensors are picking up a chain vessel on an intercept course, they inform Discovery its now or never. Saru calls for a Black Alert . Discovery rises, pulling itself free from the jungle undergrowth , at 200 feet it spore jumps . And appears right behind Osyraa's ship, ""interesting"" she mutters at a technology that could see  Discovery just appear without warning behind her. Outnumbered she orders her ship to warp away. The Federation captain  is holo projected onto the Discoveries Bridge , Welcome home Discovery.  

Episode 4: 
- Opens with a montage of the crew being debriefed and Michael being interrogated back at federation HQ. 
- Debrief complete Saru is called into Admiral Vances office. 
- They are being sent to Trill to reestablish contact . 
- A Trill first officer Lt cmdr Adira Tal is assigned as Discoveries First officer to give them someone with first hand knowledge of the 31st century and of Trill.
- Saru requests Michael,  the Admiral agrees and places Michael in Sarus custody . She is not trusted due to her previous affiliation with the Chain. 
They arrive on Trill and are surprised to be taken hostage. They are put in a holding cell and told to wait. 
-  Osyraa ship arrives in orbit and she transports down, she is greeted with full diplomatic honors not granted to their Federation Guests. 
- they inform Osyraa they have a gift for the Chain . Saru Michael and Adira are led into the room in cuffs . 
- so Kind but completely unnecessary,  release them . 
- Saru demands to know whats going on. What are the Chain doing on a Federation world.
- Thats just it , Captain you are no longer on a Federation world Trill is now a member of the Chain . 
- Saru looks at the Trill President,  while the federation retreated and licked their wounds after the burn, the Chain were there for us, their supplies staved off famine that would have killed millions,  for a modest fee interjects Osyraa, lower now you're a member of course . 
- are we free to go Saru asks , of course Osyraa answers.
- they leave and the episode ends .

Episode 5 : 
- TNG style Stand alone episode 
- Michael asks to be assigned to working on the Burn Data to combine what she already knows from the Chains Analysis. 

Episode 6 : 
- Tilly tries to Get Michael to open up about the year she spent as a member of the Chain. 
- we see Flashbacks of Michael arriving in the 31st century,  sending the suit back through the wormhole,  meeting Ossyra. 
- we see her reluctance to let go of her past life , to give up on the Federation,  but then she meets Book , a Chain Courier, and falls in love . 
-  Book had almost convinced her to leave the Chain with him when she detected  the wormhole similar to the one she came through. 

Episode 7 :
- more TNG style stand alone stuff 

Episode 8 : 
- a resource rich planet announces its ready to hear competing bids for its membership from  the federation and the Chain.
- both sides lay out their strengths and point out their opponents flaws.
- during a break in negotiations,  Tilly spots Osyraa and Michael talking in the corridor.
- before she can confront her or inform Saru negotiations resume. Things go back and forth before in a surprising turn of events Osyraa informs them they are withdrawing their bid. The question of why and what Osyraa and Michael were talking about is left hanging as the episode ends . 

Episode 9 :
- Owo and Detmar get trapped somehow and we find out more about them, why they decided to abandon all they knew to follow Michael through the wormhole. 
- Michael continues to work on the burn .
- episode ends with Micheal Discovering something important about the Burn . 

Episode 10 : 
- Michael and Stamets research leads them to believe the burn started in a particularly vicious Nebula.
- using the same technique as used in Suka'l they spore jump into a less stormy part of the nebula and transport down onto what appears to be the bridge of the Enterprise D 
- rather then a immature Kelpian they discover an elderly Q in ill fitting spandex arguing with himself , we hear Him mutter Jean Luc once or twice . 
- Q was imprisoned in the nebula over 800 years ago by the other members of the Q Continium because he was still too immature to move onto the next plane of existence. 
- the nebula dampens his powers explaining why he's aged .
- 200 years ago after 500 years of loneliness Q began to lose his mind the psychic shock waves of which caused the burn. 
- in the ready room they discuss their options, on the one hand pre imprisonment he was an agent of chaos, on the other hand if he has another psychic meltdown it could destabilise what little dilithium is left in the Alpha/beta Quadrants . They decide to break him out of his imprisonment .
- culber manages calm Q down and they transport up to the Discovery and make ready to Spore jump believing the mycelium network will allow them to breach the nebula with Q in tow.
- free from the nebula mental interference,  Q becomes more lucid and the consequences of his imprisonment and the burn, are laid out , really , I caused all that he asks. Dont worry I can fix this,  he snaps his fingers but nothing happens, with the continium gone so too went his powers, for the first time in his life he can't just snap his finger and undo his mistakes.  He is distraught.
- Culber informs him they are letting him go , there is nothing they could do that would punish him any more then he's doing himself. 
- Q leaves the ship promising to be a better man and earn the right to follow his brothers onto the next plane . 

Episode 11 
- Discovery receives a distress signal from Ossyra she claims she wants to defect and is being pursued by a chain ship. Discovery steps in and rescues her and they head back to HQ so Ossyra can be debriefed and talk to Admiral Vance . 
- when they get there Ossyra is slapped in cuffs and thrown in a cell . They don't believe her , yet. 
- The Admiral discusses their options , take what she has to say at face value or interrogate her .
- they opt for the latter , she is being led off to be interrogated when Michael energes from the shadows and stuns the guards . They sneak into Vances office taking him prisoner and locking the doors . 
- I knew I shouldn't  have trusted you (Vance to Michael) 
- episode ends 

Episode 12:

- last scene is recapped,  in her defence i have someone she loves(book was taken hostage as soon as Michael betrayed Ossyra in ep 1), so I wouldn't judge her too harshly . 
- she explains the reason for the subterfuge,  she wasn't defecting she is there to negotiate an armistice and merger between the Chain and Federation.
- as she explains it , we are a mercantile conglomerate dealing in lifes necessities , our trade network has kept hundreds of worlds economies afloat and preventing them from starving . For a price Vance retorts . Dilithium costs money Admiral, our Chains stability relies on our ability to fulfil our obligations and we are running low on Dilithium. Without more a hundred worlds will fall into chaos and starvation. Which brings me to my point , we are aware you have come into possession of a novel bit of technology that if replicated could open up the Galaxy again. We both have something the other wants Admiral , we represent 45% of the planets of your once mighty Federation , wouldn't you like them to return to the fold ? . Share the technology with us and we will forge our future together.  Vance tells her they still haven't been able to replicate the tech , let us help ossyra replies . You've given me food for thought , let me take what you've said to my superiors.  I'm trusting you Admiral ,Ossyra nods to Michael and puts her hands over her head, Michael presses a button and unlocks the door and a stream of security guards rush  in . 
-all the above would be interspersed with Discovery crew reacting to Michael's betrayal and Federation security trying to break into the office . 
-Episode ends 

Episode 13: 

-last scene recap Vance tells them its OK and to take them back to the ambassadorial quarters for now. 
- Saru it told to wait outside Vances office while he confers with the federation council on the Chains offer. 
- he emerges looking drawn . He explains the situation to Saru , the council are tentatively agreeing to the proposal,  but with a few changes , and I don't think they're going to like them . 
- in the Ambassadorial quarters , Ossyra tells Michael she doesn't blame her for her betrayal from ep 1 , we do anything for the ones we love. What do you know about love Michael retorts , I love the chain My dear the needs of its many outweigh the needs of the one or on occasion... hundred. 
- vance calls them to his office , the federation council has provisionally agreed to your proposal on one condition , you hand yourself over to be judged in a court of law for your crimes on Miranda 3 .
-ossyra is shocked and disgusted, part of the proposal was amnesty for all, what you call a massacre I call a trade dispute.  Michael drags her to a corner and reminds her what she said about Loving the chain and the needs of the many . 
- she returns to the table. Its a deal breaker for your people?, it is Vance replies . She looks back over to Burnham,  then I agree to your terms . 
- Michael meets Ossyra in the shuttle bay where she is to be taken to a penal colony to await trial.

- season ends .",How I'd have laid out Discovery season 3 .,discovery did its usual in randomly stumble upon the germ of a good idea without properly setting it up  the emerald chain being a capitalist conglomerate of worlds rather then the orion syndicate knock off they seemed  is on the face of it an interesting turn of events  but they ve left it so late in the day they ve left themselves no time to explore it before they move onto the next thing  the following is a thought experiment on how i d of laid the season out   tl dr version if you don t care to read the rest    first 4 episodes deal with burnham and discovery turning up in the 31st century and establish the status quo between the federation and the emerald chain  the middle 4 mix stand alone with tge serialised elements of michael trying to solve the mystery of the burn   the final 5 would resolve the mystery of the burn and culminate with a rejigged version of osyraas plan to gain an audience with the admiral and make her proposal   episode 1   we open with micheal working for an organisation called the emerald chain under osyraa    secretly she s trying to use its resources to find discovery   episode will establishing the galactic status quo generally and the chains perspective on the burn and the federations and its failures specifically   the episode would end with them arriving over a pre warp world the chains plans first contacts with only to find a federation ship already in orbit   red alert  episode 2      would see the discovery crash land on said pre warp planet 24 hours before    they send out a sos on federation channels and race against time to repair and free the ship before the planets pre warp inhabitants reach them    episode ends with a federation ship arriving in orbit episode 3     both ships lock weapons on eachother and demand to know what the other is doing there  the chain accuse the federation of hypocrisy for attempting to contact a pre warp civilization after all their high minded rhetoric    the federation captain accuses the chain of only being their to exploit the world for its resources  osyraa responds saying they don t exploit they strike deals  our tech for their resources   besides  you don t get to dictate how we survive the scarcity you helped cause    sensing high technology on the surface   osyraa transports michael down to investigate with a security officer   they reach discovery   the security guard is shocked to discover the crew know michael   she turns her weapon on him and takes him prisoner     after a lot of hugging saru tells michael to go help stamets get the spore drive working   back up in orbit the two captains play for time rattling their sabres     the federations ships long range sensors are picking up a chain vessel on an intercept course  they inform discovery its now or never  saru calls for a black alert   discovery rises  pulling itself free from the jungle undergrowth   at 200 feet it spore jumps   and appears right behind osyraa s ship   interesting  she mutters at a technology that could see  discovery just appear without warning behind her  outnumbered she orders her ship to warp away  the federation captain  is holo projected onto the discoveries bridge   welcome home discovery   episode 4    opens with a montage of the crew being debriefed and michael being interrogated back at federation hq    debrief complete saru is called into admiral vances office    they are being sent to trill to reestablish contact     a trill first officer lt cmdr adira tal is assigned as discoveries first officer to give them someone with first hand knowledge of the 31st century and of trill   saru requests michael   the admiral agrees and places michael in sarus custody   she is not trusted due to her previous affiliation with the chain  they arrive on trill and are surprised to be taken hostage  they are put in a holding cell and told to wait     osyraa ship arrives in orbit and she transports down  she is greeted with full diplomatic honors not granted to their federation guests    they inform osyraa they have a gift for the chain   saru michael and adira are led into the room in cuffs     so kind but completely unnecessary   release them     saru demands to know whats going on  what are the chain doing on a federation world   thats just it   captain you are no longer on a federation world trill is now a member of the chain     saru looks at the trill president   while the federation retreated and licked their wounds after the burn  the chain were there for us  their supplies staved off famine that would have killed millions   for a modest fee interjects osyraa  lower now you re a member of course     are we free to go saru asks   of course osyraa answers   they leave and the episode ends  episode 5     tng style stand alone episode   michael asks to be assigned to working on the burn data to combine what she already knows from the chains analysis  episode 6     tilly tries to get michael to open up about the year she spent as a member of the chain    we see flashbacks of michael arriving in the 31st century   sending the suit back through the wormhole   meeting ossyra    we see her reluctance to let go of her past life   to give up on the federation   but then she meets book   a chain courier  and falls in love      book had almost convinced her to leave the chain with him when she detected  the wormhole similar to the one she came through  episode 7    more tng style stand alone stuff episode 8     a resource rich planet announces its ready to hear competing bids for its membership from  the federation and the chain   both sides lay out their strengths and point out their opponents flaws   during a break in negotiations   tilly spots osyraa and michael talking in the corridor   before she can confront her or inform saru negotiations resume  things go back and forth before in a surprising turn of events osyraa informs them they are withdrawing their bid  the question of why and what osyraa and michael were talking about is left hanging as the episode ends   episode 9    owo and detmar get trapped somehow and we find out more about them  why they decided to abandon all they knew to follow michael through the wormhole    michael continues to work on the burn    episode ends with micheal discovering something important about the burn   episode 10     michael and stamets research leads them to believe the burn started in a particularly vicious nebula   using the same technique as used in suka l they spore jump into a less stormy part of the nebula and transport down onto what appears to be the bridge of the enterprise d   rather then a immature kelpian they discover an elderly q in ill fitting spandex arguing with himself   we hear him mutter jean luc once or twice     q was imprisoned in the nebula over 800 years ago by the other members of the q continium because he was still too immature to move onto the next plane of existence    the nebula dampens his powers explaining why he s aged    200 years ago after 500 years of loneliness q began to lose his mind the psychic shock waves of which caused the burn    in the ready room they discuss their options  on the one hand pre imprisonment he was an agent of chaos  on the other hand if he has another psychic meltdown it could destabilise what little dilithium is left in the alpha beta quadrants   they decide to break him out of his imprisonment    culber manages calm q down and they transport up to the discovery and make ready to spore jump believing the mycelium network will allow them to breach the nebula with q in tow   free from the nebula mental interference   q becomes more lucid and the consequences of his imprisonment and the burn  are laid out   really   i caused all that he asks  dont worry i can fix this   he snaps his fingers but nothing happens  with the continium gone so too went his powers  for the first time in his life he can t just snap his finger and undo his mistakes   he is distraught   culber informs him they are letting him go   there is nothing they could do that would punish him any more then he s doing himself    q leaves the ship promising to be a better man and earn the right to follow his brothers onto the next plane   episode 11   discovery receives a distress signal from ossyra she claims she wants to defect and is being pursued by a chain ship  discovery steps in and rescues her and they head back to hq so ossyra can be debriefed and talk to admiral vance     when they get there ossyra is slapped in cuffs and thrown in a cell   they don t believe her   yet    the admiral discusses their options   take what she has to say at face value or interrogate her    they opt for the latter   she is being led off to be interrogated when michael energes from the shadows and stuns the guards   they sneak into vances office taking him prisoner and locking the doors     i knew i shouldn t  have trusted you  vance to michael    episode ends episode 12   last scene is recapped   in her defence i have someone she loves book was taken hostage as soon as michael betrayed ossyra in ep 1   so i wouldn t judge her too harshly     she explains the reason for the subterfuge   she wasn t defecting she is there to negotiate an armistice and merger between the chain and federation   as she explains it   we are a mercantile conglomerate dealing in lifes necessities   our trade network has kept hundreds of worlds economies afloat and preventing them from starving   for a price vance retorts   dilithium costs money admiral  our chains stability relies on our ability to fulfil our obligations and we are running low on dilithium  without more a hundred worlds will fall into chaos and starvation  which brings me to my point   we are aware you have come into possession of a novel bit of technology that if replicated could open up the galaxy again  we both have something the other wants admiral   we represent 45  of the planets of your once mighty federation   wouldn t you like them to return to the fold     share the technology with us and we will forge our future together   vance tells her they still haven t been able to replicate the tech   let us help ossyra replies   you ve given me food for thought   let me take what you ve said to my superiors   i m trusting you admiral  ossyra nods to michael and puts her hands over her head  michael presses a button and unlocks the door and a stream of security guards rush  in    all the above would be interspersed with discovery crew reacting to michael s betrayal and federation security trying to break into the office    episode ends episode 13   last scene recap vance tells them its ok and to take them back to the ambassadorial quarters for now    saru it told to wait outside vances office while he confers with the federation council on the chains offer    he emerges looking drawn   he explains the situation to saru   the council are tentatively agreeing to the proposal   but with a few changes   and i don t think they re going to like them     in the ambassadorial quarters   ossyra tells michael she doesn t blame her for her betrayal from ep 1   we do anything for the ones we love  what do you know about love michael retorts   i love the chain my dear the needs of its many outweigh the needs of the one or on occasion    hundred    vance calls them to his office   the federation council has provisionally agreed to your proposal on one condition   you hand yourself over to be judged in a court of law for your crimes on miranda 3   ossyra is shocked and disgusted  part of the proposal was amnesty for all  what you call a massacre i call a trade dispute   michael drags her to a corner and reminds her what she said about loving the chain and the needs of the many     she returns to the table  its a deal breaker for your people   it is vance replies   she looks back over to burnham   then i agree to your terms     michael meets ossyra in the shuttle bay where she is to be taken to a penal colony to await trial    michael promises to

0,"Before I get into it, I want to make one point crystal clear. If this is the only thing you get from this post, make it this: taste politics are stupid. There is nothing wrong with enjoying or even loving media that isn't good. But enjoying something doesn't make it good, either.

It's been interesting to see the revisionist takes on ENT crop up over the years, and it seems worsened by the new era of Trek. I don't know what show some of you were watching the way some of you praise ENT.

Again, no one is on blast for enjoying it. But people trying to now argue that it's actually good? C'mon. Those are some nostalgia-induced revisions, and reactionary in nature. I get it. The current spat of Trek shows are polarizing. Disco season 3 really won me over, and Lower Decks was delightfully amusing, but the rest is pretty awful. But just because Picard is mind bogglingly stupid doesn't make ENT good. And just because watching ENT is connected to a special time in your life doesn't make it a good show, either. 

I guess all of this begs the question: what makes for a good show? Obviously there isn't a single answer for this, because every show is unique. Instead we can analyze how well it achieved its goals, as well as comparing its practices to relevant conventions in TV.

And in that regard, it's maybe mediocre overall. There are some good episodes, but there's a lot of rehashed Star Trek plots in there too. It made Star Trek feel narrow and limited. ""We need to have an episode about a transporter malfunction because this is what Trek does."" 

(Also the temporal cold war was started with seemingly no idea what they wanted to do with it or realizing how utterly confusing it would make all of Star Trek. I will die on this hill.)

So yeah, celebrate your love for it! Hell I've seen it like 3 times now. There's some killer episodes in there, and some fun ones. Just don't get clouded by nostalgia. Love it for what is, not what you want it to be.",Nostalgia in action: ENT is good now?,before i get into it  i want to make one point crystal clear  if this is the only thing you get from this post  make it this  taste politics are stupid  there is nothing wrong with enjoying or even loving media that isn t good  but enjoying something doesn t make it good  either it s been interesting to see the revisionist takes on ent crop up over the years  and it seems worsened by the new era of trek  i don t know what show some of you were watching the way some of you praise ent again  no one is on blast for enjoying it  but people trying to now argue that it s actually good  c mon  those are some nostalgia induced revisions  and reactionary in nature  i get it  the current spat of trek shows are polarizing  disco season 3 really won me over  and lower decks was delightfully amusing  but the rest is pretty awful  but just because picard is mind bogglingly stupid doesn t make ent good  and just because watching ent is connected to a special time in your life doesn t make it a good show  either  i guess all of this begs the question  what makes for a good show  obviously there isn t a single answer for this  because every show is unique  instead we can analyze how well it achieved its goals  as well as comparing its practices to relevant conventions in tv and in that regard  it s maybe mediocre overall  there are some good episodes  but there s a lot of rehashed star trek plots in there too  it made star trek feel narrow and limited   we need to have an episode about a transporter malfunction because this is what trek does    also the temporal cold war was started with seemingly no idea what they wanted to do with it or realizing how utterly confusing it would make all of star trek  i will die on this hill  so yeah  celebrate your love for it  hell i ve seen it like 3 times now  there s some killer episodes in there  and some fun ones  just don t get clouded by nostalgia  love it for what is  not what you want it to be nostalgia in action  ent is good now

0,"I've watched ST since the originals, but can't recall an episode where it approached the elephant in the room regarding transporters. That is, if ""you"" can be turned into data, stored and reconstituted, what does that say about consciousness and identity?

There was an episode where someone was stuck in the transporter ""buffer"", which underlines that question even more. A buffer can be copied, so would the copies have the same identity / consciousness?

Specifically, how does the idea of a ""spiritual"" existence cohabitate with the idea of digitisable, and therefore copyable, matter?

Has any Star Trek episode or literature explored that?","As Star Trek has a long history with transporters, has it ever tackled the issue of identity and consciousness being ""digitisable""?",i ve watched st since the originals  but can t recall an episode where it approached the elephant in the room regarding transporters  that is  if  you  can be turned into data  stored and reconstituted  what does that say about consciousness and identity there was an episode where someone was stuck in the transporter  buffer   which underlines that question even more  a buffer can be copied  so would the copies have the same identity   consciousness specifically  how does the idea of a  spiritual  existence cohabitate with the idea of digitisable  and therefore copyable  matter has any star trek episode or literature explored that as star trek has a long history with transporters  has it ever tackled the issue of identity and consciousness being  digitisable

0,"I've been seeing a lot of the ""badmirals"" trope thrown around recently when discussing the awesome Admiral Vance on Discovery. But I feel that's an outdated and misapplied trope that only applies to TOS and early TNG.

So, because I have nothing better to do on this chilly January COVID Saturday, with the assistance of Memory Alpha I'm going to evaluate every Starfleet Commodore, Rear Admiral, Admiral, and Fleet Admiral that's appeared on screen to determine if they truly are bad.

##Evaluation

I am leaving out flag officers that were only seen impersonated (e.g. Admiral Bullock by Species 8472), under the unwilling control of another force (Vice Admiral Aaron by the brain slugs), spies or moles (Commodore Oh is a Romulan Zhat Vash General) or merely mentioned with no affect on the story.

I am also only considering a character's actions while they held the rank of Admiral and ignoring what they did before attaining the rank (Captain Pressman's command of the Pegasus) or after retiring (Norah Satie's investigation).

Alternate reality versions of these flag officers that have no impact on the main timeline are ignored. I am including the Kelvin films, though.

Characters that appear as Admirals in multiple shows/films (Nechayev) will only be counted in one.

They will all be held to the expectations of that rank.

##Enterprise

##Conclusion

Among Star Trek on TV, as expected TOS and TNG led the pack with badmirals, largely in the form of corrupt or inept flag officers. I was surprised by DS9's high score, though the Admiral representation in that series is dominated by Ross, and the two bad ones still believed that they were doing the right thing for the right reasons.

This evaluation did not weight any Admiral's score with their importance to the story, and a quick perusal will find that any time an Admiral is a focus of a single episode they'll probably be bad, but if they're just giving orders over a screen they're usually okay, but possibly disconnected from the reality out in the field. If an Admiral shows up more than once they're almost certain to be good, even if they may occasionally be bad for a good cause.

Our favorite Captains also tend to make poor flag officers. They belong in a chair out exploring the stars.

two bad ones still believed that they were doing the right thing for the right reasons this evaluation did not weight any admiral s score with their importance to the story  and a quick perusal will find that any time an admiral is a focus of a single episode they ll probably be bad  but if they re just giving orders over a screen they re usually okay  but possibly disconnected from the reality out in the field  if an admiral shows up more than once they re almost certain to be good  even if they may occasionally be bad for a good cause our favorite captains also tend to make poor flag officers  they belong in a chair out exploring the stars what s truly bad is the badmirals trope  it s old  outdated  and weak storytelling the  badmirals  trope is an outdated product of tos and early tng  a somewhat superficial and silly analysis

0,"So I see a lot of antipathy online towards season one of Deep Space Nine- some actively dislike it while others think it doesn't hold up to its successors. I think season one is pretty great, and  I think 'The Storyteller' is a great example why. The plot with the paqu and Navut is pretty standard Trek fare and isn't the most inspired- but the exploration of Jake and Nog's friendship is great and charming and some of it is genuinely hilarious. Nog's awkwardness (saying 'great idea' when they offer to show Varis the wormhole) fleshes out some of his character, and the father and son relationship between Sisko and Jake is enjoyable. The episode is full of little touches of characterization that make me laugh; Sisko pulling Jake back when he's about to kiss Varis, Kira saying 'at least we all agree on something' and awkwardly smiling. The plot with O'Brien and Bashir is also great, and lays the groundwork for their future friendship. I think this episode exemplifies why I love Deep Space Nine and its first season especially. The characterization is just amazing, and the plots that are decried as 'slow' and 'boring' give the actors time to show their characters.

But every season there seems to be at least one time travel episode and every other season an alternate reality episode.

I'll admit to being surprised by quite a few of the scores from Rotten Tomatoes, which aggregates multiple reviews into a single average score.

**Television**

1. TAS: 94%
2. DS9: 90%
3. TNG: 89%
4. PIC: 87%
5. DSC: 85%

13. TFF: 21%

I'm also quite surprised to see The Animated Series come out as the best reviewed show, while The Lower Decks appearing so low is equally surprising.

In this far future, we may wonder about the other races we knew so well. Where are the Klingons and Cardassians? What will the Borg look like in this future?

But we need not wonder about the Ferengi. They will never be seen in this future. 

How can I be sure of this?

It’s because the Ferengi have already been reintroduced.  They are hiding in plain sight and are now called the Orions. In this future, the Orions have become all of the things that the Ferengi were. Or more accurately, they have become all of the things that the Ferengi should have been before they were turned into a joke. 

Let’s think back to the start of TNG. The Ferengi were supposed to be the main villains of TNG. It was an interesting choice. In TOS, the main villains were the Klingons and the main philosophical debate was between cooperation (the Federation) and conquest (the Klingons). This conflict mirrored the Cold War reality at that time between the USA and Russia. In TNG the main philosophical debate was going to be cooperation (the Federation) vs Capitalism (the Ferengi). But sadly this was not the case. The Ferengi bombed and the Romulans took their place. 

But now in DISCO, it seems like we have come back to the start of TNG at least philosophically (cooperation vs capitalism). The only difference is that the Ferengi have been replaced by Orions. 

But have the Ferengi really been replaced? Perhaps the Ferengi have just been reskinned?

Let’s look at the main villain of the 3rd season of DISCO, Osyraa. She looks like an Orion but she sure does act like a Ferengi. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if she had a copy of the Rules of Acquisition in her back pocket. She certainly follows the Rules of Acquisition quite closely. 

Here are some examples of Osyraa following the Rules of Acquisition. 


“ The riskier the road, the greater the profit.” 62nd rule. 
She is a risk-taker. Osyraa takes big risks looking for big payoffs. Stealing Discovery and taking it to the Federation was a big gamble. 


“Know your enemies... but do business with them always” 177th rule. 
She is a businessperson who makes deals to get what she wants. After she got Discovery past the Federation’s shields, what did she do? Attack like a Klingon? No she tried to make a deal. How Ferengi can you get!


“Never ask when you can take”  52nd rule. 
Of course, Osyraa is not always so polite. When she has the upper hand she does as she pleases. 


“There is no honor in poverty” 106th rule. 
“My ancestors knew that power is virtue, and there is no nobility in suffering. “ Osyraa. Nuff said. 


“Never allow family to stand in the way of opportunity” 6th rule. 
Osyraa killed her nephew. As she said herself  “You do what it takes to get what you need, or you don’t.”.  

“Beware the man who doesn't take time for Oo-mox” 223rd rule. Ferengi believe that people should enjoy the sensual pleasures of life. Osyraa is very sensual.  Look at the way she sat on the captains chair after she took Discovery from Tilly. She took time to enjoy her victory. 

“Learn the customer's weaknesses, so that you can better take advantage of him” 87th rule. Osyraa is very manipulative. She has her chief scientist, Aurelio, thinking that she will save the universe as she saved him. 

“Hear all, trust nothing” 190th rule. Ferengi see nothing wrong with telling lies. Lies are a natural part of communication among Ferengi. Trying to figure out what someone is lying about is part of the fun of social interaction as far as Ferengi are concerned. Thus when Osyraa is talking about the lie detector holo, she says “Where’s the fun in that?”. 

Every time I look at Osyraa, I see a Ferengi. 

But wait!

You might say that she is a woman! Ferengi women are not allowed to engage in business!

In this case we can assume that Rom’s reforms of Ferengi society have taken hold and women are now equal to men in Ferengi society.",There will never be Ferengi in DISCO (spoilers!),with the jump into the far future in the 3rd season of disco  we have the chance to be reintroduced to old friends with new twists  the vulcans and romulans are now reunited  earth has become isolationist and even the federation itself is dramatically altered in size and  in character  in this far future  we may wonder about the other races we knew so well  where are the klingons and cardassians  what will the borg look like in this future but we need not wonder about the ferengi  they will never be seen in this future  how can i be sure of this it s because the ferengi have already been reintroduced   they are hiding in plain sight and are now called the orions  in this future  the orions have become all of the things that the ferengi were  or more accurately  they have become all of the things that the ferengi should have been before they were turned into a joke  let s think back to the start of tng  the ferengi were supposed to be the main villains of tng  it was an interesting choice  in tos  the main villains were the klingons and the main philosophical debate was between cooperation  the federation  and conquest  the klingons   this conflict mirrored the cold war reality at that time between the usa and russia  in tng the main philosophical debate was going to be cooperation  the federation  vs capitalism  the ferengi   but sadly this was not the case  the ferengi bombed and the romulans took their place  but now in disco  it seems like we have come back to the start of tng at least philosophically  cooperation vs capitalism   the only difference is that the ferengi have been replaced by orions  but have the ferengi really been replaced  perhaps the ferengi have just been reskinned let s look at the main villain of the 3rd season of disco  osyraa  she looks like an orion but she sure does act like a ferengi  i wouldn t be surprised if she had a copy of the rules of acquisition in her back pocket  she certainly follows the rules of acquisition quite closely  here are some examples of osyraa following the rules of acquisition    the riskier the road  the greater the profit   62nd rule  she is a risk taker  osyraa takes big risks looking for big payoffs  stealing discovery and taking it to the federation was a big gamble   know your enemies    but do business with them always  177th rule  she is a businessperson who makes deals to get what she wants  after she got discovery past the federation s shields  what did she do  attack like a klingon  no she tried to make a deal  how ferengi can you get  never ask when you can take   52nd rule  of course  osyraa is not always so polite  when she has the upper hand she does as she pleases   there is no honor in poverty  106th rule   my ancestors knew that power is virtue  and there is no nobility in suffering    osyraa  nuff said   never allow family to stand in the way of opportunity  6th rule  osyraa killed her nephew  as she said herself   you do what it takes to get what you need  or you don t      beware the man who doesn t take time for oo mox  223rd rule  ferengi believe that people should enjoy the sensual pleasures of life  osyraa is very sensual   look at the way she sat on the captains chair after she took discovery from tilly  she took time to enjoy her victory   learn the customer s weaknesses  so that you can better take advantage of him  87th rule  osyraa is very manipulative  she has her chief scientist  aurelio  thinking that she will save the universe as she saved him   hear all  trust nothing  190th rule  ferengi see nothing wrong with telling lies  lies are a natural part of communication among ferengi  trying to figure out what someone is lying about is part of the fun of social interaction as far as ferengi are concerned  thus when osyraa is talking about the lie detector holo  she says  where s the fun in that    every time i look at osyraa  i see a ferengi  but wait you might say that she is a woman  ferengi women are not allowed to engage in business in this case we can assume that rom s reforms of ferengi society have taken hold and women are now equal to men in ferengi society there will never be ferengi in disco  spoilers  
0,"Star Trek has memorable characters with some degree of ""identity crises"" — e.g. Spock, Data, Dax (especially Ezri), Odo, The Doctor, Seven, and even T'Pol — and quite generally it is an important component in the character development but not the only interesting aspect of their personality. Today I was thinking about how underutilized B'Elanna was.

Just for comparison, Spock had his quarrels with McCoy, the friendship with Kirk. Data explored many aspects of ""humanity"". We could even compare B'Elanna with Ezri, the latter had just one season, but her development was decent. For six seasons B'Elanna was the ""competent engineer &amp; tough half-Klingon"". That's it. Eventually, the writers remembered ""Ohh! we can explore her background!"" - Her mother was introduced in the 6th season (Barge of the Dead - very good episode) and her father in the 7th season (Lineage). Her Maquis background is just a footnote - my goodness, these episodes could have been fantastic.

0,"When I think about how star trek treats disability I think of Geordi and his blindness. On first thought it seems handled very well. They managed to effectively remove his disablility and he can function as if he were not blind.

But the more I think about it, is this the right way to treat disability?

There are two ways to do it: modify the environment for the person or modify the person for the environment. What happened to Geordie was the latter but what we seem to do in our society is the former. We try to make accomodations for people whereas they didn't even need to make changes to the environment to accomodate Geordies disability.

When I think of another example of blindness - Tukov in Year of Hell - this was done differently. Tuvok had a tactile interface in order to use the console. This was an example of modifying the environment to accomodate an individual which I think is a better way of dealing with disability rather than just writing it out with a visor. So I end up thinking that they actually handled Geordie's blindness poorly.

Another example of disability is in DS9 melora, which I watched recently. It's about a person who is incredibly weak in normal gravity. Their solution is a radical medical procedure and at no point was it considered to modify the environment to suit her disability. It was such an obvious solution to have her work in a low g environment but they made no accomodation for her disability.

This leaves me to conclude that star trek handles disability very poorly.

0,"So this question probably doesn't make any sense, but I felt the need to ask it regardless. Here's the more specific version: power in this context is rated in three categories (with some subcategories) : 1v1 (fist fight and ranged), race vs race (space and ground), and starship competence (crew member and captain). All races have access to the exact same resources (with technology coming from Starfleet) for equal measurments. Superiority in the categories can be achieved through extreme excellence in one aspect or a more general competence. This rule is restricted to races of a sizable population (so no one man races), stability (no races that are going extinct), organic nature (no artificially created races), and single dimensional status (no Q or others like them). The idea behind this question is to determine which race could beat the most others in the three listed categories. Hopefully the discussion can stay on more well known races, but if there's an obscure race out there that's faster, stronger, smarter, etc. that can win without cheating with reality warping  then they are who I am looking for.","What is the ""strongest"" Federation race?",so this question probably doesn t make any sense  but i felt the need to ask it regardless  here s the more specific version  power in this context is rated in three categories  with some subcategories    1v1  fist fight and ranged   race vs race  space and ground   and starship competence  crew member and captain   all races have access to the exact same resources  with technology coming from starfleet  for equal measurments  superiority in the categories can be achieved through extreme excellence in one aspect or a more general competence  this rule is restricted to races of a sizable population  so no one man races   stability  no races that are going extinct   organic nature  no artificially created races   and single dimensional status  no q or others like them   the idea behind this question is to determine which race could beat the most others in the three listed categories  hopefully the discussion can stay on more well known races  but if there s an obscure race out there that s faster  stronger  smarter  etc  that can win without cheating with reality warping  then they are who i am looking for what is the  strongest  federation race

Then they went down to a planet and found a bunch of Borg that were still connected, but not part of the collective. One of them was a human lady that became a love interest of the ship's crew. But she was wearing a wig to hide that she was a Borg.

Then they connected with one of the crew to heal/save him. And then that cube near the planet was destroyed.

In the end, this mini-collective took advantage of the Federation ship and its crew for reasons that I remember as being devious.

0,"I think there is plenty of criticism from Trekkies/Trekkers regarding *Discovery* and probably for good reason. But I think it is important not only to determine what is wrong, but suggest what would be a better alternative. (We should also note what they are currently doing right, but that isn't my topic here.) I'm just an old-fashioned country Trekker, not used to these fancy big city streaming programs, so I am aware I may just have unreasonable expectations in wanting this show to be like the other shows I know and love. I also think it's important to note the ""learning curve"" on most Trek shows has tended to be about three seasons. . . remember the Ferengi or Doctor Pulaski? Or the Kazon? I'm hoping that's the case here.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I want from Discovery (that I'm obviously not getting now):

1. **I want a show that focuses on the** ***crew*** **of Discovery, not on one individual character.** If they are paying these actors to be on the bridge through three seasons, why do I know only half of their names?
2. **I want a show that, at least occasionally, has individual episodes that have nothing to do with a wider universe, a huge story arc, or anything outside the episode.** Just a good self-contained 3-act episode about a crazy planet they find or a mysterious ship adrift in space, etc. With the current formula, you can't have genius stories like ""The Inner Light."" I swear *Breaking Bad* ruined TV on this front; every show has to be written like a damn soap opera nowadays. And yes, get off my damn lawn, you kids.
3. **I want a show that takes a breath every once in awhile.** Slow down the pace, dammit. Show these people *living their lives*. You know, like the poker games on the Enterprise-D, or the crew hanging out in ten forward. Note that there doesn't always have to be a dramatic argument (whisper or loud) or physical fight going on, as is apparently mandatory on the USS Discovery.
4. **I want a show that, at least occasionally, has a clear message based on the actual plot of the episode(s).** Sure, there are plenty of speeches but they rarely have anything to do with the episode and usually they're just talking about how great the Federation is. That's not actually an ethical message, it's just politics and/or propaganda.
5. **Similarly, I want a show that follows consistent ethical standards.** Discovery presents us with the most morally ambiguous Trek series and depiction of Starfleet (until they get to the future where the one and only Admiral is super wise), but I don't know if this is actually a good thing. Especially since it takes place in the prime universe where we have been conditioned to believe that Starfleet and the Federation are almost always attempting to do what is right. How do we go from Discovery with its lying, scheming and machinations to the super-enlightened USS Enterprise only a few years later? If Kirk, Picard, Sisko or Janeway were captain, Burnham would be in the brig and Georgiou would have been tried for war crimes/genocide/whatever other heinous crimes she's clearly perpetrated.
6. **I would like a show that will present an enlightened perspective on social issues, beyond simply having a diverse crew.** This show has way too many characters thrown in simply to represent some demographic and they don't even have enough time to do the characters justice. I'm not gonna name names, but there are some characters on this show that barely have a name or are simply one-dimensional but are clearly included so we can have ""one of them"" in the show. That's actually the opposite of progressive; it's called tokenism. There is a fine line here. If you have a complex character and you decide to cast a minority, that is progressive. If you hastily throw in a minority at the last minute so they can stand in the background, that is. . . sigh, an all-too-common practice in TV and movies. Probably asking too much here.
7. **I want a show that isn't afraid to tackle tough philosophical and/or contemporary issues.** You know, like Star Trek used to do? Even if the message seems dated to us now, the episode ""Let the Be Your Last Battlefield"" from TOS was very relevant and made a powerful statement when it aired. Likewise, ""The Outcast"" from TNG, though dated to our eyes, took an honest stab at dealing with many aspects of sexuality and gender politics. (It would be less dated if they hadn't toned it down from the original conception, and Jonathan Frakes was totally down with it too, according to interviews. . . but we're stuck with what they made. )
8. **I want a show that stays in one ""universe"" for the most part.** Jumping timelines/universes is the scifi screenwriting equivalent of ""and then he woke up."" Just plain lazy. It can be interesting in small doses but not if you turn half the show into that. It give writers an easy way out if they get backed into a corner by a story.
9. **I want** ***fun*** **episodes.** Anyone remember ""The Trouble With Tribbles?"" It may not be an absolute laugh riot but it's cute and makes you chuckle, which is really all that needs to happen. I couldn't imagine an episode like that taking place in the current Discoveryverse.
10. **I want a show that sets limits on itself.** You know, like the fact that the ship can only go so fast, or transporters have a limited range, or people can't *just go anywhere instantly.* When the Enterprise D is being chased by a Borg cube and they can't outrun it, that's genuinely frightening. Discovery is at serious risk of giving itself the Superman problem, wherein there are no real stakes because they have too many incredible powers.

TL;DR: I want a show that is ""Star Trek"" in more than name only.",The ten things I want from Discovery as a Trekker,i think there is plenty of criticism from trekkies trekkers regarding  discovery  and probably for good reason  but i think it is important not only to determine what is wrong  but suggest what would be a better alternative   we should also note what they are currently doing right  but that isn t my topic here   i m just an old fashioned country trekker  not used to these fancy big city streaming programs  so i am aware i may just have unreasonable expectations in wanting this show to be like the other shows i know and love  i also think it s important to note the  learning curve  on most trek shows has tended to be about three seasons      remember the ferengi or doctor pulaski  or the kazon  i m hoping that s the case here  amp  x200b here s what i want from discovery  that i m obviously not getting now  1    i want a show that focuses on the      crew      of discovery  not on one individual character    if they are paying these actors to be on the bridge through three seasons  why do i know only half of their names 2    i want a show that  at least occasionally  has individual episodes that have nothing to do with a wider universe  a huge story arc  or anything outside the episode    just a good self contained 3 act episode about a crazy planet they find or a mysterious ship adrift in space  etc  with the current formula  you can t have genius stories like  the inner light   i swear  breaking bad  ruined tv on this front  every show has to be written like a damn soap opera nowadays  and yes  get off my damn lawn  you kids 3    i want a show that takes a breath every once in awhile    slow down the pace  dammit  show these people  living their lives   you know  like the poker games on the enterprise d  or the crew hanging out in ten forward  note that there doesn t always have to be a dramatic argument  whisper or loud  or physical fight going on  as is apparently mandatory on the uss discovery 4    i want a show that  at least occasionally  has a clear message based on the actual plot of the episode s     sure  there are plenty of speeches but they rarely have anything to do with the episode and usually they re just talking about how great the federation is  that s not actually an ethical message  it s just politics and or propaganda 5    similarly  i want a show that follows consistent ethical standards    discovery presents us with the most morally ambiguous trek series and depiction of starfleet  until they get to the future where the one and only admiral is super wise   but i don t know if this is actually a good thing  especially since it takes place in the prime universe where we have been conditioned to believe that starfleet and the federation are almost always attempting to do what is right  how do we go from discovery with its lying  scheming and machinations to the super enlightened uss

0,"Bear in mind that this is based on my subjective taste, and what I enjoy in a TV show. I totally get that my opinions are weird and not universal. I just want to try and explain why I am so frustrated with this particular aspect of Discovery, among others. 

I watch Discovery every week. I enjoy it! The good parts keep me slogging through the bad parts, and there are way more good parts. (Goddamn, did I love seeing human Saru!) 

Now, with that said... 

Things I hate about Burnham as a character: 

- Her emotional reactions are tiring;
- Her dialog is quite often badly written melodrama. 
- She cries too much. 
- The show focuses on her instead of more interesting characters. 
- The other characters worship her for no good reason. 
- She wins by being right when she didn't have enough data to know it. 
- She seems to be specifically designed as the most extreme version of a Mary Sue it is possible to have. Remember that episode of Futurama with Welshy, and the Trekkie fanboy energy being who forced the TOS crew to play out his bad fanfiction? 

Now that you hate me, let me try to win you back. 

Things I love about Burnham as a character:
- Her relationship with Book. I love it when those two are together, they have brilliant chemistry! Especially when the cat is involved. All Hail Queen Grudge! 
- When her and Book were off the ship and having adventures together, I enjoyed the show so much more! I hoped like mad that the season would be half ""Michael and Book wander the galaxy saving endangered species"" and half ""The Discovery crew get to shine without Burnham getting in their damn way"" episodes.
- Her getting high on drugs and ""infiltrating "" a market was fantastic.
- Her and Spock bounced off each other really well. I really got the brother-sister vibe. 
- She's great in action scenes! I love seeing her fight Klingons, or indeed anyone. 

See, all those points, and more, are how I know it's not Sonequa Martin-Green's fault at all. I am outraged at the writers/showrunners for doing this to a perfectly good actor. It's like Robert Pattinson in Twilight, or Deniro in a Sandler movie. 

Discovery is so frustrating! There's so many good people working on it, it has such great ideas, but too often executed so badly, with lazy writing and idiot plots. 

Anyway, hope that helped you understand why people go on and on about Burnham, while still really loving this mycelial-network, mirror-universe, lgbt as fuck, diverse, forward-thinking, defiantly itself, genuine Star Trek show. :)

P. S. The characters I love unreservedly, some of who are part of why I keep watching, who I always want more of: Saru, Stamets, Culver, Adira, Admiral Vance, Tilly (although making her first officer was dumb af), Jett Reno, Lorca, Pike, and Emperor Georgiou (although the crew should have kept hating her as hard as the DS9 crew hated Dukat. Another incomprehensible writing decision!).

I enjoyed the episode, though it’s definitely no Measure of a Man. But it could’ve been. They should have made the second portion of the episode it’s own story, one that truly discusses hologram rights and dedicates the time to it. MOAM is my fave TNG ep because it’s so powerful, and VOY could have had their own version. 

The Doctor writing his own story about hologram struggles is also a great plot idea, though wish he make an autobiography instead (would’ve had the message that holograms CAN make their own decisions and be their own people, rather than creating a darker version of Tuvix).

I see all these criticisms and arguments about her being the focus of the show, while many of them make a good point which I'm also inclined to agree, but that's like arguing Kirk or Picard or Sisko or Janeway or Archer are getting the spotlight. 

She might be written poorly, that's the writers' fault, not the character's. The show DOES revolve around her. This is as much about BURNHAM and her crew as TNG was about PICARD and his gang. 

So those of you with misgivings, understandable as it may be, about Burnham getting so much attention in the show, let's hope they write her better moving forward as she will still be the center of attention for as long as this show exists, whether you like it or not.","All this talk about Burnham being the center of Discovery, y'all seem to forget...",she is the main character for the show  not the captain  or anybody else  it has always been the case since the show was first announced that the mc would be the  number one  i e  michael burnham  i see all these criticisms and arguments about her being the focus of the show  while many of them make a good point which i m also inclined to agree  but that s like arguing kirk or picard or sisko or janeway or archer are getting the spotlight  she might be written poorly  that s the writers  fault  not the character s  the show does revolve around her  this is as much about burnham and her crew as tng was about picard and his gang  so those of you with misgivings  understandable as it may be  about burnham getting so much attention in the show  let s hope they write her better moving forward as she will still be the center of attention for as long as this show exists  whether you like it or not all this talk about burnham being the center of discovery  y all seem to forget

0,"This was initially a comment in response to a thread that's since been locked. 

In my humble opinion, I think that 13 episode seasons is partially what's killing Discovery this season, and has held it back in the previous two. Without the 10-15 bottle episodes we got with TNG/DS9/VOY, we don't get to see the character growth we're being told is happening off screen. 

If we had episodes driven by and focused on other characters, the focus on Burnham as the central character wouldn't seem so stark and overbearing - it would be more like your Sisko-focussed episodes during the last couple of seasons of DS9. 

Also, it would let Discovery breathe a bit. We're in the 32nd Century, they have the Spore Drive, let's do some discovering!! Revisit more old Trek species. Visit a planet still in the Federation - we haven't seen any yet. Interact with other Starfleet ships and crews - I'm dying to see what the Voyager-J bridge is like, or who her captain is. Show us how other crews react to a 900-year old museum ship appearing and expecting to join the fleet. Explore the new technologies that are suddenly available to a crew 900 years out of place - give me some goddamn technobabble!! 

Discovery likes to tell us what Starfleet and the Federation is all about, but the writers and producers of the show don't seem to realise that Star Trek isn't all about the plot arc, getting from A to B to C and wrapping things up with a tidy little bow. It's the human stories that go alongside it that shows us things like La Forge and Data's friendship, Seven of Nine becoming more human. In Discovery it could easily show why the bridge crew got to like/respect Georgiou, or how the crew got to grips with their new normal in a much reduced Federation.

There are so many stories crying out to be told in this new universe, but 13 episodes ain't enough.

0,"After watching a really good episode of Voyager (Year of hell) on watch party with a streamer last night, and then watching the first episode of TNG I decided to look into what is hurting the new series' and why people seem to hate them. In the search for what makes those series' inferior I found a lot of anger and in-fighting about all of the series' and each of the films. I understand that there is a lot of change between series' and they aren't all for everyone but it was like everywhere I turned fans were fighting fans about why Star Trek sucks. I'm usually one to be able to ignore the bad parts of a fanbase (See: Ween and Undertale) but as somebody who has been searching for a Jumping-on point for several years I'm wondering if it's really worth it. If the fans seem to hate every series'. For example in the comments of an article about what people disliked about Picard there was a long comment chain where everyone just trashed TNG TOS and Voyager (as well as Discovery, Lower Decks, and Picard of course) along with people insulting others' countries, languages, and cultures. Is this what I have to look forward to? Completely missing the entire point of a bunch of the plotlines?  I'd like to hope that those fans are simply a minority but it still makes me question whether to continue watching. If a fanbase hates the thing they're a fan of so much.

0,"In this episode, Heart of Glory, the Enterprise unwittingly rescues a couple Klingon fugitives. Even apart from the simple fact they're Klingons, these guys are dangerous.

So when it's discovered that they are wanted by the Klingons, Picard sends a fucking security team to arrest them and take them to ~~the brig~~ security. Why doesn't he use site to site transportation?? 

A fight doesn't break out yet, but when they're ready to transport the prisoners to the Klingon battle cruiser, Picard **again** sends a security team to escort them to the transporter room. Not to mention they don't notice the two Klingons openly assembling a disruptor in the cell... So ofc the Klingons kill at least two Starfleet officers.

I understand maybe in the interest of fairness that Picard would want to alert the Klingon fugitives to their situation. But you can do that **and** use site-to-site transport!

Is this a plot hole? Do they address this in the episode and I didn't hear it? Did anyone else notice this? I couldn't find reference to this anywhere online.

**TL;DR**: In this episode, they forgo the use of site-to-site transport when moving Klingon prisoners/fugitives, opting for escort by human security team. This gets two officers killed. Why don't they use the tech? Why can't I find anything about this online?

The tech is inconsistent here compared to later seasons, but this one really stood out to me as stupid.

0,"I don't think it's wrong or illegitimate to dislike Michael Burnham. Honestly I'm kind of ""meh"" on her myself. 

But I think the hatred for her is a bit over-the-top.

You can't win if you're Burnham. If the show portrays you as a capable hero who gets kicks ass and gets shit done, the fandom cries: ""She's a Mary Sue! She's too perfect! It's not Star Trek and it's lazy writing!"" If the show portrays you as being a good-hearted but kinda screwed-up person who grows and changes, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse, the fandom cries: ""She's not Starfleet material! This isn't Roddenberry's vision for humanity! It's not Star Trek and it's lazy writing!""

Basically what I'm learning here is that that a huge chunk of the fandom has started from the premise that Michael Burnham doesn't belong on Star Trek and then proceeded to look for reasons why.

And if her mistakes and flaws and bad decisions *do* turn out to have consequences, they're never *enough.* She needs to be punished *more,* for the heinous crime of being Michael Burnham.

Like I said: I'm not the biggest Burnham fan. She's...fine. Like Luke Skywalker is fine, or Harry Potter is fine, or Neo is fine. Or James T. Kirk is fine. A lot of protagonists for action-adventure stories are often just solid viewpoint characters surrounded by a much more interesting supporting cast. Personally I tend to  find the secondary characters more fun and compelling.

But that doesn't make me hate the protagonists for having the job of being protagonists.

Again. If you don't like Burnham, I can't tell you you're wrong for having that opinion (unless it's because of her race or gender, I guess. But other than that). I just don't see why this much of the fandom's emotional energy needs to be expended on hating a character who, in a lot of episodes, is...just kind of *there.*",The extreme hatred for Burnham is a little weird.,i don t think it s wrong or illegitimate to dislike michael burnham  honestly i m kind of  meh  on her myself  but i think the hatred for her is a bit over the top you can t win if you re burnham  if the show portrays you as a capable hero who gets kicks ass and gets shit done  the fandom cries   she s a mary sue  she s too perfect  it s not star trek and it s lazy writing   if the show portrays you as being a good hearted but kinda screwed up person who grows and changes  sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse  the fandom cries   she s not starfleet material  this isn t roddenberry s vision for humanity  it s not star trek and it s lazy writing  basically what i m learning here is that that a huge chunk of the fandom has started from the premise that michael burnham doesn t belong on star trek and then proceeded to look for reasons why and if her mistakes and flaws and bad decisions  do  turn out to have consequences  they re never  enough   she needs to be punished  more   for the heinous crime of being michael burnham like i said  i m not the biggest burnham fan  she s   fine  like luke skywalker is fine  or harry potter is fine  or neo is fine  or james t  kirk is fine  a lot of protagonists for action adventure stories are often just solid viewpoint characters surrounded by a much more interesting supporting cast  personally i tend to  find the secondary characters more fun and compelling but that doesn t make me hate the protagonists for having the job of being protagonists again  if you don t like burnham  i can t tell you you re wrong for having that opinion  unless it s because of her race or gender  i guess  but other than that   i just don t see why this much of the fandom s emotional energy needs to be expended on hating a character who  in a lot of episodes  is   just kind of  there  the extreme hatred for burnham is a little weird

0,"I care about Star Trek. I've probably spent more time watching this franchise than any other. And up until a few weeks ago I was a staunch defender of Discovery, despite its lack of continuity. Like many series before it I thought it would figure things out and hit its stride somewhere around season 3. I was wrong.

Past shows got better by eliminating their weaknesses and focusing on their strengths. Unnecessary, or weak plots and characters are jettisoned, and better plots and characters are brought in. Everything gets tweaked until they land on something that feels right. 

We go from this:  [WAREHOUSE FIND: Image (wordpress.com)](https://nostalgiazone.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/star-trek-next-generation.jpeg?w=656) 

To this:  [star\_trek\_next\_generation.jpg (1920×1080) (cbsstatic.com)](https://wwwimage-secure.cbsstatic.com/base/files/star_trek_next_generation.jpg) 

And then they settle on it, and do deep dives into character development. Entire episodes are dedicated to learning about various crew members, and how they are a special and integral part of the team. Over time you find yourself caring about the entire crew and their relationships more. This is done organically through good writing. The way Riker handles being abducted. The way Picard handles living another life in the matter of a few minutes. How Geordi handles being turned into an alien. How the rest of the crew handles those situations together.

\---

When they settled on Saru being Captain of Discovery I sighed in relief. I was getting tired of them flipping through Captains. Saru is my favorite character, too. That episode about his past, and his home planet was really enlightening and made me connect with him. I love stories about characters who grow and become bigger and stronger than they thought they could. 

Finally, I thought, the show can find an identity, anchored by a really great character.

But all through season 3 the plot kept getting FORCED toward Michael in ways that make no sense. I'll just focus on one right now.

Why is Michael at the center of solving The Burn? And why was her strategy for finding it not already explored before she arrived? The technique she used to pin-point the source of The Burn is probably the only option they had, yet she was the only one to think of it? 

For some perspective: As far back as 132 AD ancient China had developed a seismometer to pin point the location of earthquakes. 

Yet, this super advanced society, thousands of years more advanced, can't even *imagine* looking for discrepancies that might help it find a source of The Burn ----- until Michael Burnham arrives? 

Want to know why the show 24 fizzled out? It's because the writers couldn't continually write Jack Bauer into the center of everything going on in the United States without it becoming ridiculous. And that was a show unapologetically about *one man deliberately disregarding orders for the greater good*. 

With Discovery, they're trying to make Michael Burnham the center of everything in the *universe*. It was already ridiculous before the season began, but this year they've tossed any and all common sense out the window and doubled down on their choice to make the show all about her. 

Which would be fine if the writing could make that happen organically. Which would be fine if she was a character worthy of that kind of gravitas. But it's not. And she's not. She's the weakest character on the show. But then we get that line about her being ""Cut out for the captains chair."" Saru, the most professional character with the most intriguing story -- he's not? He's inevitably going to be forced out so that Michael Burnham, the least professional and least interesting character on the show can replace him? 

For the record: I don't hate Burnham's character. I just hate that the show is centered around her and that the plot is written around that. It doesn't fit. It doesn't make sense. It's not interesting. It's not fun. It's not Star Trek.","Lifelong Star Trek fan, with valid criticisms of Discovery",i care about star trek  i ve probably spent more time watching this franchise than any other  and up until a few weeks ago i was a staunch defender of discovery  despite its lack of continuity  like many series before it i thought it would figure things out and hit its stride somewhere around season 3  i was wrong past shows got better by eliminating their weaknesses and focusing on their strengths  unnecessary  or weak plots and characters are jettisoned  and better plots and characters are brought in  everything gets tweaked until they land on something that feels right  we go from this    warehouse find  image  wordpress com    to this    star trek next generation jpg  1920 1080   cbsstatic com    and then they settle on it  and do deep dives into character development  entire episodes are dedicated to learning about various crew members  and how they are a special and integral part of the team  over time you find yourself caring about the entire crew and their relationships more  this is done organically through good writing  the way riker handles being abducted  the way picard handles living another life in the matter of a few minutes  how geordi handles being turned into an alien  how the rest of the crew handles those situations together     when they settled on saru being captain of discovery i sighed in relief  i was getting tired of them flipping through captains  saru is my favorite character  too  that episode about his past  and his home planet was really enlightening and made me connect with him  i love stories about characters who grow and become bigger and stronger than they thought they could  finally  i thought  the show can find an identity  anchored by a really great character but all through season 3 the plot kept getting forced toward michael in ways that make no sense  i ll just focus on one right now why is michael at the center of solving the burn  and why was her strategy for finding it not already explored before she arrived  the technique she used to pin point the source of the burn is probably the only option they had  yet she was the only one to think of it  for some perspective  as far back as 132 ad ancient china had developed a seismometer to pin point the location of earthquakes  yet  this super advanced society  thousands of years more advanced  can t even  imagine  looking for discrepancies that might help it find a source of the burn       until michael burnham arrives  want to know why the show 24 fizzled out  it s because the writers couldn t continually write jack bauer into the center of everything going on in the united states without it becoming ridiculous  and that was a show unapologetically about  one man deliberately disregarding orders for the greater good   with discovery  they re trying to make michael burnham the center of everything in the  universe   it was already ridiculous before the season began  but this year they ve tossed any and all common sense out the window and doubled down on their choice to make the show all about her  which would be fine if the writing could make that happen organically  which would be fine if she was a character worthy of that kind of gravitas  but it s not  and she s not  she s the weakest character on the show  but then we get that line about her being  cut out for the captains chair   saru  the most professional character with the most intriguing story    he s not  he s inevitably going to be forced out so that michael burnham  the least professional and least interesting character on the show can replace him  for the record  i don t hate burnham s character  i just hate that the show is centered around her and that the plot is written around that  it doesn t fit  it doesn t make sense  it s not interesting  it s not fun  it s not star trek lifelong star trek fan  with valid criticisms of discovery

I had planned on watching Year of Hell over midnight to end 2020, but I wound up with an HD copy of BoBW instead.
Through the quarantine I've been enjoying taking screenshots of special effects and model shots from the laptop. A new source of wallpapers and keeps my photo editing and eye sharp.
I noticed in some scenes, specifically now the Enterprise warping away as the Borg cube explodes, that the motion lines and blur in a paused screen advancing frame by frame tend to show up in advance of the rest of the object moving.
Is there something I don't know about how digital screen grabs work when the source material is on pause, or could it be that motion blur shows up in shots that were done backwards during production and played back forwards and recomposited afterwards in the final project?

Troy asks the computer to replicate her a ""real"" chocolate sunday but the computer says that it's not within dietary guidelines, implying that it can be done.

0,"This way, should someone die during the mission their most recent pattern (captured at the time of departure) could be rematerialized along with the other crew members when they beam up, as if nothing happened, though the resurrected crew member would of course remember nothing of the mission, only up to the point when they were dematerialized.  


Yes, patterns degrade while in the pattern buffer. But how quickly? I could bring up the episode when Scotty used a transporter for stasis purposes but that is held to have been a special circumstance, the other guy he tried to save didn't make it. This one time, his pattern remained stable for multiple decades. But because it was a fluke, we can't consider it representative.  


There is however a DS9 episode wherein the crew of an exploding spacecraft are rescued via transporter at the last possible moment, but cannot be rematerialized right away. The entire station's memory is cleared so their patterns can be stored (nine people if I recall correctly). Their patterns remained in storage for...A few days? I think?   


This furnishes a more representative example because it wasn't a specially rigged setup by miracle worker Scotty, but a quickly improvised solution using standard transporter tech available on the station. We have no reason to believe O'Brien did anything special with the DS9 transporters in this situation which couldn't be replicated, unlike Scotty's stasis feat.   


That establishes that patterns can be kept in the buffer long enough for the typical away mission and then some without fatal degradation occurring. We know there exists sufficient memory onboard starships for as many patterns as they have transporter pads, as in order to transport that many people simultaneously, they need sufficient memory to keep that many patterns in the buffer during transport.  


So, why isn't this standard practice? Away missions are risky endeavors. Should someone die during the mission, there's no good reason, even given in-universe constraints on transporter technology, why their death should be permanent.",There is no in-universe reason why transporters couldn't keep a backup of away team members in case of death.,this way  should someone die during the mission their most recent pattern  captured at the time of departure  could be rematerialized along with the other crew members when they beam up  as if nothing happened  though the resurrected crew member would of course remember nothing of the mission  only up to the point when they were dematerialized   yes  patterns degrade while in the pattern buffer  but how quickly  i could bring up the episode when scotty used a transporter for stasis purposes but that is held to have been a special circumstance  the other guy he tried to save didn t make it  this one time  his pattern remained stable for multiple decades  but because it was a fluke  we can t consider it representative   there is however a ds9 episode wherein the crew of an exploding spacecraft are rescued via transporter at the last possible moment  but cannot be rematerialized right away  the entire station s memory is cleared so their patterns can be stored  nine people if i recall correctly   their patterns remained in storage for   a few days  i think    this furnishes a more representative example because it wasn t a specially rigged setup by miracle worker scotty  but a quickly improvised solution using standard transporter tech available on the station  we have no reason to believe o brien did anything special with the ds9 transporters in this situation which couldn t be replicated  unlike scotty s stasis feat    that establishes that patterns can be kept in the buffer long enough for the typical away mission and then some without fatal degradation occurring  we know there exists sufficient memory onboard starships for as many patterns as they have transporter pads  as in order to transport that many people simultaneously  they need sufficient memory to keep that many patterns in the buffer during transport   so  why isn t this standard practice  away missions are risky endeavors  should someone die during the mission  there s no good reason  even given in universe constraints on transporter technology  why their death should be permanent there is no in universe reason why transporters couldn t keep a backup of away team members in case of death 
0,"The writers seem to have tried to make season 3 better but I feel it could improve on a certain things.

Before an action scene is where character development seems to happen and is extremely predictable. The conversations always seem to be in the lines of "" I may or may not come back, so let's bond"". I'm pretty sure after going through what they did, they are pretty used to it. Like the scene where they were trying to investigate the source of burn at the verubin nebula, it's almost like exploration and didn't need the excessively dramatic conversations before they ventured out. 

From the recent episode, we discover osyraa speaks about the good side of her and it happens just one episode before the finale which isn't good. It's almost like they were still writing the character after the shooting began.

The story still moves through the eyes of Burnham which makes it lack the flow this show badly needs. Maybe half an episode dedicated to explaining the orion syndicate and how they came to what they are, talking about the scientist guy Aurelio and his accomplishments would have made it much smoother and would have made this show even better.",DIS S03 is better than the previous seasons but it lacks the flow,the writers seem to have tried to make season 3 better but i feel it could improve on a certain things before an action scene is where character development seems to happen and is extremely predictable  the conversations always seem to be in the lines of   i may or may not come back  so let s bond   i m pretty sure after going through what they did  they are pretty used to it  like the scene where they were trying to investigate the source of burn at the verubin nebula  it s almost like exploration and didn t need the excessively dramatic conversations before they ventured out  from the recent episode  we discover osyraa speaks about the good side of her and it happens just one episode before the finale which isn t good  it s almost like they were still writing the character after the shooting began the story still moves through the eyes of burnham which makes it lack the flow this show badly needs  maybe half an episode dedicated to explaining the orion syndicate and how they came to what they are  talking about the scientist guy aurelio and his accomplishments would have made it much smoother and would have made this show even better dis s03 is better than the previous seasons but it lacks the flow

0,"Background: I only started Discovery this year. Lifelong Trekkie, it’s my go-to show when stressed or anxious at night, etc. Have gone to the convention here in Vegas multiple times. Love it all. I just resisted Discovery because of the while All Access thing and some of the spoilers I’ve heard over the years didn’t really interest me.

That said, here’s my unoriginal take: Michael Burnham has turned in to a terrible main character and Discovery is suffering as a result. Mid-Season 3, it got so bad, I almost quit the show (still might). Am I alone in this thought?

Season 1: Klingons aside, I dug first season Michael. I dig everything from lighting to the ‘twist’, all that. I even pressed the ‘I believe’ button on Spock’s secret sister storyline. In hindsight it wasn’t necessary but it made for compelling episodes, so it works.

Season 2: Klingons Corrected. Complete tone shift. Michael means more to Spock, Spock is insane but also saves time and space, show runners boot Discovery to the future with an excellent tie in with a Michael’s mom and her upbringing... solid stuff. Georgiou is loved but not exactly believable for me in most of the situations she’s in.  They finally started building the other characters a la every other Trek show.  I’m excited for Season 3! Michael hangs with her mom, maybe?! We’ll see!

Season 3: The future! ‘Fresh Trek!’ Saru is a boss. He should have his own show. But ... Why is Michael always breaking rules but allowed to continue serving Starfleet in any commanding rank? Her reckoning is to be removed from XO but still finds herself at most of the important decision making meetings? Why is every other line whispered? Why does she come and go as she pleases and why is it always her to fix the issue? She is never wrong and when she is, somehow gets validated anyway. Don’t get me started on somehow whisper-debating her way through several hundred years of Romulan-Vulcan politics in an afternoon and somehow being the only person who thought about checking the black boxes (doesn’t the Chain have some pretty clever folk?). Don’t get me started on Plot-Device-Monk Mom. The Sisterhood of Traveling Candor felt THAT comfortable with such a new acolyte that they’d send her own mother to be Micheal’s second? That whole episode wreaked of hamfisting a narrative just to keep Michael as the plot engine.

Season 3 seems to be Star Trek: Micheal Burnham. Episode 3 is where I started to notice. Season 1 and 2 were always Michael focused bit their plots kinda dictated it. Season 3 has a more ‘global’ plot and for some reason the writers of Discovery are doing everything they can to make Michael an episode-to-episode lynchpin with far too much melodrama.",Discovery: My Michael Burnham Take [Spoilers],background  i only started discovery this year  lifelong trekkie  it s my go to show when stressed or anxious at night  etc  have gone to the convention here in vegas multiple times  love it all  i just resisted discovery because of the while all access thing and some of the spoilers i ve heard over the years didn t really interest me that said  here s my unoriginal take  michael burnham has turned in to a terrible main character and discovery is suffering as a result  mid season 3  it got so bad  i almost quit the show  still might   am i alone in this thought season 1  klingons aside  i dug first season michael  i dig everything from lighting to the  twist   all that  i even pressed the  i believe  button on spock s secret sister storyline  in hindsight it wasn t necessary but it made for compelling episodes  so it works season 2  klingons corrected  complete tone shift  michael means more to spock  spock is insane but also saves time and space  show runners boot discovery to the future with an excellent tie in with a michael s mom and her upbringing    solid stuff  georgiou is loved but not exactly believable for me in most of the situations she s in   they finally started building the other characters a la every other trek show   i m excited for season 3  michael hangs with her mom  maybe   we ll see season 3  the future   fresh trek   saru is a boss  he should have his own show  but     why is michael always breaking rules but allowed to continue serving starfleet in any commanding rank  her reckoning is to be  from xo but still finds herself at most of the important decision making meetings  why is every other line whispered  why does she come and go as she pleases and why is it always her to fix the issue  she is never wrong and when she is  somehow gets validated anyway  don t get me started on somehow whisper debating her way through several hundred years of romulan vulcan politics in an afternoon and somehow being the only person who thought about checking the black boxes  doesn t the chain have some pretty clever folk    don t get me started on plot device monk mom  the sisterhood of traveling candor felt that comfortable with such a new acolyte that they d send her own mother to be micheal s second  that whole episode wreaked of hamfisting a narrative just to keep michael as the plot engine season 3 seems to be star trek  micheal burnham  episode 3 is where i started to notice  season 1 and 2 were always michael focused bit their plots kinda dictated it  season 3 has a more  global  plot and for some reason the writers of discovery are doing everything they can to make michael an episode to episode lynchpin with far too much melodrama discovery  my michael burnham take  spoilers

0,"One of Kirk's top traits is skill as a military tactician, he quickly and clearly sees his enemies’ weakness and how to exploit it.  For example in the episode “The Balance of Terror” Kirk quickly picks up that the Romulan Bird of Prey decloaks before it fires because it has to.  According to the Romulan Commander it was like Kirk was a sorcerer who lived in his mind. 

Another great examples is “Charlie X.” In that episode Kirk realizes the powerful Charlie Evans often makes people disappear when he’s angry with them, however he also notices that Charlie stops doing this when he takes over the ship.  Kirk concludes, correctly as it turns out, that Charlie’s power is limited in that if he activates all his ship’s systems he may be able to overload him.  Kirk defeats Charlie just in time for the Thasians to pick him up. 

Even when he was over-powered in The Corbomite Maneuver  he was able to outsmart his opponent by bluffing and does it again in his next encounter with the Romulans.   

Kirk also shows of his skill taking the most sophisticated AIs into killing themselves. And despite his intelligence, Mr. Spock often loses at chess to Captain Kirk.    

However with Trelane all his skills seem to mislead him.  Kirk notices that Trelane likes the mirror and he concludes reasonably that the mirror is the source of his power.  When he destroys it Kirk thinks he has won but doesn't realize that he has miscalculated until he tires to turn his ship around and sees Gothos facing him again.    

As Picard says in the next century "" It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.""

It is worth noting that every time Trelane meets Kirk on even grounds Kirk knocks him on his butt. However the boy god just falls back each time on his power.  Finally he grows board and corners Kirk and the only thing that saves our dear Captain is the arrival of Trelane's parents.

I write Star Trek TOS fanfics on a regular basis, but recently started a crossover fic with Kirk, Picard, Janeway, Sisko, Archer and their crews all teaming up. 

Unfortunately, some steps in, I realized that I’m giving too many awesome moments to the captains I like the best – Kirk and Sisko – and nowhere near enough to the others. So, in the interests of doing justice to the characters, I’m gonna try a sort of referendum. Please cooperate, fellow Trekkies. 

The situation is, there is a Thanos type threat which can wipe out not only the Federation, but the entire Multiverse. Q freaks out, and not being willing/able to risk his own skin, responds by pulling in all the five legendary captains and their crews to handle this.

1. Which captain/crew would be the best to handle a direct battle with the threat

2. Which captain/crew  would be the best to handle the diplomatic part of the mess – try and talk down the threat

3. Which Captain/crew would be the best at distracting said threat by focusing all its attention on them, allowing the other ships to get past and take care of certain business

4. Which captain/crew would be the greatest liability – the most likely to need rescue

5. Which Captains/crews would be most likely to clash with each other

6. Which captain/crew would be the best at a stealth mission

7. There is one captain whom all the other four are united in their desire to throw out of the airlock. Which one should it be

8. Which captain/crew would be the most likely to mess up their part of the plan

9. Which captain/crew would be the likeliest to discover key  information about the threat

On the other hand, religiosity can be cultural, and varies a lot within the human race. There are countries and there have been time periods where irreligion is/was almost unthinkable. Also, Bajorans had to live under a very long and repressive occupation that ravaged their world and caused the deaths of tens of millions, so it's understandable that they clung to religion as a coping mechanism.

I  didn't like DISCO at first. Especially some bad reviews of  Season 1 and 2 really made me think they just went full Star Wars.

And I am so glad I did.

The second episode with the whole Janeway and B'Elanna dynamic was incredible and I thought it was a fantastic episode. The third and fourth episodes actually made me love Kes, Neelix, and the Doctor with all their quirks and unique personalities.

0,"I just finished ""There is a Tide..."" and I found the entire sequence with Vance/Osyraa fascinating. And I'm not at all convinced the Admiral made the correct decision.

By the Admiral's own admission the ceasefire is an amazing treaty (short of his one request, we'll get to that). We know it ends slavery on countless worlds, and starts a 15 year plan to abandon 50 exploited pre-warp civilizations (a plan likely covered in that treaty he read). As Osyraa rightly pointed out, anything faster would be chaos. You can't just create a power vacuum overnight like that.

We also learned that Osyraa isn't the dictator of The Emerald Chain. She made reference to a parliament/congress (can't remember the word she used) which actually passed laws and needed ""enough support"" to do so. Suggesting a semi-large and diverse legal body. Yes Osyraa has done horrible things, but she is not her government. (I would lake to take a moment now to point out the democracies of the world, mine included, which have spent the past few years enjoying a less-then-idyllic leaders. Now tell me this makes the entire Emerald Chain, that just voted out slavery, evil.)

The ""Episode Discussion"" thread is understandably spare right now at 12:30pm PST, but I am amazed at the number of ""well obviously Osyraa was fooling the lye-detector somehow"" comments. Even without the above legal stuff, can we as a fandom really praise the ideals of the Federation so highly yet not even entertain the idea that Osyraa wants this to work? She may be machiavellian in her methods but she is still a leader. So I am going to accept the fact that the lie detector wasn't faulty and everything Osyraa said was true. Admiral Vance believed it and he knows a lot more about The Chain then we do.

So taking all that into account, I don't think insisting on persecuting Osyraa at the cost of the entire treaty is the right decision. Especcially not when made unilaterally by the Admiral rather then the Federation Civilian Government (which, may I remind you, is located in the same station as Starfleet). In fact I think Osyraa may have even been persecuted anyways in time as The Chain slowly liberalized.

The Galaxy is incredibly destabilized at the moment. The Federation has the dylithium supply and a Spore drive, and dozens of planets and outposts with zero infrastructure. Meanwhile The Chain has is primarily a currier service with the scientific ability to turn that spore drive into a blueprint, but no dylithium. Both sides have what the other needs. Yes The Chain has slavery and oppresses 50 primitive worlds. But it is one Federation signature from ending slavery for thousands if not millions and freeing those worlds. That alone is a stabilizing force but the end of hostilities between the two major powers is even bigger. The distribution of dylithium and eventual spore drive technology is enough to get the galaxy back on track.

So Admiral Vance, if allowing one villan who is now extending the hand of peace to go free goes against Federation principles widespread slavery, the oppression of 50 worlds, and an open state of conflict then I'm sorry. The neighboring nation has a bad egg. Now tell me the Klingons never did in TNG. Or the Romulans during the Dominion War. Heck show me one decade, just one, where a high ranking Starfleet officer didn't go against Federation ideals.

At the very least, peace was worth a chance",Was the right decision made in the latest episode?,i just finished  there is a tide     and i found the entire sequence with vance osyraa fascinating  and i m not at all convinced the admiral made the correct decision by the admiral s own admission the ceasefire is an amazing treaty  short of his one request  we ll get to that   we know it ends slavery on countless worlds  and starts a 15 year plan to abandon 50 exploited pre warp civilizations  a plan likely covered in that treaty he read   as osyraa rightly pointed out  anything faster would be chaos  you can t just create a power vacuum overnight like that we also learned that osyraa isn t the dictator of the emerald chain  she made reference to a parliament congress  can t remember the word she used  which actually passed laws and needed  enough support  to do so  suggesting a semi large and diverse legal body  yes osyraa has done horrible things  but she is not her government   i would lake to take a moment now to point out the democracies of the world  mine included  which have spent the past few years enjoying a less then idyllic leaders  now tell me this makes the entire emerald chain  that just voted out slavery  evil  the  episode discussion  thread is understandably spare right now at 12 30pm pst  but i am amazed at the number of  well obviously osyraa was fooling the lye detector somehow  comments  even without the above legal stuff  can we as a fandom really praise the ideals of the federation so highly yet not even entertain the idea that osyraa wants this to work  she may be machiavellian in her methods but she is still a leader  so i am going to accept the fact that the lie detector wasn t faulty and everything osyraa said was true  admiral vance believed it and he knows a lot more about the chain then we do so taking all that into account  i don t think insisting on persecuting osyraa at the cost of the entire treaty is the right decision  especcially not when made unilaterally by the admiral rather then the federation civilian government  which  may i remind you  is located in the same station as starfleet   in fact i think osyraa may have even been persecuted anyways in time as the chain slowly liberalized the galaxy is incredibly destabilized at the moment  the federation has the dylithium supply and a spore drive  and dozens of planets and outposts with zero infrastructure  meanwhile the chain has is primarily a currier service with the scientific ability to turn that spore drive into a blueprint  but no dylithium  both sides have what the other needs  yes the chain has slavery and oppresses 50 primitive worlds  but it is one federation signature from ending slavery for thousands if not millions and freeing those worlds  that alone is a stabilizing force but the end of hostilities between the two major powers is even bigger  the distribution of dylithium and eventual spore drive technology is enough to get the galaxy back on track so admiral vance  if allowing one villan who is now extending the hand of peace to go free goes against federation principles widespread slavery  the oppression of 50 worlds  and an open state of conflict then i m sorry  the neighboring nation has a bad egg  now tell me the klingons never did in tng  or the romulans during the dominion war  heck show me one decade  just one  where a high ranking starfleet officer didn t go against federation ideals at the very least  peace was worth a chancewas the right decision made in the latest episode

0,"I think if voyager had been made in the past ten years then this is what it would have been like

1. the maquis would have mutinied and tried to take over the ship by the end of the first season.  
2. Voyager would get into fire fights in almost every episode but not have repaired the damage by the next episode.  The ship would be falling apart like in year of hell.  
3. The crew would have to become sociopaths to survive the delta quadrant.  Mutiny would become common.  And it would be more like the terran empire where officers advance in rank by killing those who outrank them. 
4. If janeway and chakotay were killed and tuvok had to take over as captain god help him.  A lot of the crew doesn't like him and he would be fending off attempted mutinies on an almost daily basis.  
5. Janeway would execute more people.  Especially mutineers.   Janeway would reluctantly have to torture aliens in arilocks like archer did.
6. Q would interact with the crew of voyager and realize they have become a group of barbarians.  And put them on trial.  
7. Neelix would be thrown out the airlock because everyone hates his cooking.
8. Janeway would have a total mental breakdown when she realizes what a hell hole the delta quadrant is.  And that she should have gotten her crew home by any means necessary.

Anyway these are just a few things that I think would be different if voyager was a modern show.

Of course I still want to play some form of DnD until we can meet again in person so I said I would join. Now of course I have to do research to get into the role play. The DM gave us a bare bones episode guide to watch from every series to understand the relevant lore but whoops I just started watching every episode of TOS and TNG. 

I’m halfway through season 2 of TNG and anticipate catching up to all of the seasons and series by March at this rate.

0,"This is something I been wanting to do forever, just rewatch the entire franchise from start to finish. The problem is I'm just too lazy to do it lol. And to be fair, I watch tons of Trek all year as it is and the last two years has been tons of it since they announced the Picard show watching tons of TNG and the other shows; including a complete rewatch of DS9 last year when the documentary was coming out. I probably seen at least 200 hours of classic Star Trek in the last two years alone. None of that counts all the new shows like DIS, PIC and LDS. So I'll be rewatching everything I seen!

I decided to do it in chronological order because it's just more fun that way! So I will be going from the 22nd to the 32nd century! Woo-hoo! And this is the order I will mostly watch it in:

1. Enterprise
2. Discovery seasons 1-2
3. The Original Series
4. The Animated Series (Will be my first time EVER watching this BTW)
5. The Original Series movies (TMO-TUC)
6. The Next Generation 
7. Deep Space Nine (seasons 1-3)
8. Generations
9. Voyager(season 1-2)
10. Deep Space Nine (season 4)
11. First Contact
12. Voyager (season 3-4)
13. Deep Space Nine (season 5)
14. Insurrection
15. Deep Space Nine (season 6-7)
16. Voyager (season 5-7)
17. Nemesis
18. Lower Decks
19. The Kelvin movies
20. Picard
21. Discovery (season 3...and maybe 4?)

Damn that's a lot of Star Trek lol. Now, I've given myself until September 8th to finish, but it's not some hard and fast rule. I'm just going to watch as much as I can whenever I can or have the urge to. But hopefully I'll finish it all in the year the latest. The only real rule is to watch every show and movie in order and not skip anything. Yes, even Spock's Brain and Threshold. ;)

And let's be honest, once Discovery is done next week, there probably won't be any new Trek on until late summer/early fall at best. So perfect time for it!

0,"Just got the idea of Quantum Dream (Detroit Become human, Beyond 2 souls) or someone like them making a Star Trek game that takes ENTIRELY on a star ship. Maybe not one as large as the Enterprise, but definitely a smaller ship with perhaps 75 crew members. 

The world should be EXTREMELY detailed. Think Skyrim level of detail, but scaled down to a ship. Every crew member should have his or her own quarters with his or her own background and personal decorations with a story in their quarters. 

Every crew member has their own schedule and jobs (like in Oblivion but...better).

Every crew member should have their own side mission and you should be able to keep track of crew members like you could keep track of character schedules in Zelda Majora's Mask.

Everyone has interactions with everyone, and they especially have interations with you, like Mass Effect or Tell Tale games.

Can be either 3rd person or 1st person, but im thinking first person would be better.

You play as first officer. You make sure everything on the ship is running accordingly. Engineering, security, science, medical bay, etc all answer to you, but it's your job to make sure they have everything they need to function properly. This is the sim portion of the game.

How well everyone functions will dictate how well your battles go. You will have ship to ship battles, although political and diplomatic methods are preferred. Imagine wanting to have a peaceful resolution with the klingons or romulans, and a peaceful resolution is possible; however, a choice you made earlier in the game makes it impossible, and as such, you get into a battle. If you have done your job properly and engineering/security/medical etc all function properly, you do well in the fight. If you sucked and as such your crew sucks, well, you take heavy damage. 

and in Fire Emblem like fashion, characters actually die. So you may have spent 10 whole hours trying to romance Ensign Lira Lwaxanton and BOOM, she was lost in a hull breach, her body lost to the vacuum of space.

You can have away missions, and they can be small load outs, like planet missions in mass effect 1 only....better.

You can choose your away mission crew. You think it's a good chance for Ensign Timmy Pascal to earn his promotion. The mission is going well, and you can tell Ensign Pascal is trying his earnest not to let you down. You cant help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment for your crewman, youre definitely going to put in for his promotion.

THEN BOOM! He gets Tasha Yar'd bc you didnt choose your away team appropriately (like the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2).

Away mission combat would be ripped directly from XCOM. 
Ship to ship battle would be essentially the game ""Star Trek Bridge Crew""

Everything else would be Tell Tale/Mass Effect/Quantum Dream/Majora's Mask/Fire Emblem choice making.

And last but not least: Holodeck. In addition to side missions specifically designed to be trippy (like most holodeck episodes), you can also just straight-up use the holodeck to grind individual crew members for away missions (think Mememtos from Persona 5)",Star Trek game developed by Quantum Dream (dream game),just got the idea of quantum dream  detroit become human  beyond 2 souls  or someone like them making a star trek game that takes entirely on a star ship  maybe not one as large as the enterprise  but definitely a smaller ship with perhaps 75 crew members  the world should be extremely detailed  think skyrim level of detail  but scaled down to a ship  every crew member should have his or her own quarters with his or her own background and personal decorations with a story in their quarters  every crew member has their own schedule and jobs  like in oblivion but   better  every crew member should have their own side mission and you should be able to keep track of crew members like you could keep track of character schedules in zelda majora s mask everyone has interactions with everyone  and they especially have interations with you  like mass effect or tell tale games can be either 3rd person or 1st person  but im thinking first person would be better you play as first officer  you make sure everything on the ship is running accordingly  engineering  security  science  medical bay  etc all answer to you  but it s your job to make sure they have everything they need to function properly  this is the sim portion of the game how well everyone functions will dictate how well your battles go  you will have ship to ship battles  although political and diplomatic methods are preferred  imagine wanting to have a peaceful resolution with the klingons or romulans  and a peaceful resolution is possible  however  a choice you made earlier in the game makes it impossible  and as such  you get into a battle  if you have done your job properly and engineering security medical etc all function properly  you do well in the fight  if you sucked and as such your crew sucks  well  you take heavy damage  and in fire emblem like fashion  characters actually die  so you may have spent 10 whole hours trying to romance ensign lira lwaxanton and boom  she was lost in a hull breach  her body lost to the vacuum of space you can have away missions  and they can be small load outs  like planet missions in mass effect 1 only    better you can choose your away mission crew  you think it s a good chance for ensign timmy pascal to earn his promotion  the mission is going well  and you can tell ensign pascal is trying his earnest not to let you down  you cant help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment for your crewman  youre definitely going to put in for his promotion then boom  he gets tasha yar d bc you didnt choose your away team appropriately  like the suicide mission in mass effect 2  away mission combat would be ripped directly from xcom  ship to ship battle would be essentially the game  star trek bridge crew everything else would be tell tale mass effect quantum dream majora s mask fire emblem choice making and last but not least  holodeck  in addition to side missions specifically designed to be trippy  like most holodeck episodes   you can also just straight up use the holodeck to grind individual crew members for away missions  think mememtos from persona 5 star trek game developed by quantum dream  dream game

0,"The Eugenics Wars were a very big deal in the past history of Trek's universe. One consequence was that humanity decided to embark upon a future that was anti-transhumanist. Humans would explore space for enlightenment, rather than becoming post-humans. I almost suspect the Federation itself would have some anti-eugenics feature in its constitution.

That said, the rejection of genetic engineering and transhumanism was in a context in which eugenics was embraced broadly beforehand. Hints from Trek and my sense of Roddenberry's attitudes makes me think that there was eugenics in Trek.

That is, Trek features ""liberal eugenics"". This is where all eugenics is done individually and not institutionally, and it is done in the context of a human relationship producing a child out of love.

You would have a fence of law built around eugenics, but within that fence technology would be applied to the absolute limit. 

First of all ""picking the best fruit"" - where a woman's eggs and a man's sperm are harvested and surveyed and the man and woman can choose which combination of their own genes is preferred.

Second, mate selection based on genetic profiles.

Third, epigenetic management (engineering everything except for the genes).

Fourth, things like best practices for nutrition and child development to unlock the full potential of a person's genetic baseline.

When people date, they'd check genetic profiles as casually as people today talk about whether they want to raise kids in the city or the country. A person who loves music might want to find a gifted musician to have kids with.

But this is all liberalized, so nothing is force, there are no rules to it and you can do ultimately what you want. However, there is effectively a eugenic program in the society.

My evidence for this - and it's more of a Roddenberry conceit - is that Season 1 episode with the child who has calculus homework.

Clearly Roddenberry is implying a few things by this. Educational methods will be ""that good"" in the future, half of why mankind is more mature. Maybe Starfleet are the best of the best, so smart even their kids are natural geniuses.

However, I think - given Roddenberry's very casual and open attitudes about sexual liberalization and how we should shed certain inhibitions and the idea of techno-progressivism - that Roddenberry is implying that people themselves are smarter and better in the future. That this isn't transhumanist (which they back then called ""eugenics""), but rather natural. Which is implicitly eugenecist.

Anyway, I like to sometimes think about the elements of the future in Trek that we take for granted (like no money) and how it might work a lot differently than we think. After all, if we knew how it worked, we'd do it already. The whole point is they've figured some things out that we haven't. That's why it's the future.

Even so, the question of liberal eugenics is interested. Once cultural stigmas wane, there's no reason not to do it. On the other hand, eugenics is a concession that some ""kinds"" of children are more valuable than other ""kinds"". That will play in poorly to social divisions and structural inequities.

We aren't mature enough yet to engage in eugenics with a liberal spirit, we'll use it to embed our imperfections. In this sense, eugenics is paradoxical. It's the quest for a more perfect version of our imperfect selves.",Eugenics Wars - I Think There Are Still Eugenics In The Future,the eugenics wars were a very big deal in the past history of trek s universe  one consequence was that humanity decided to embark upon a future that was anti transhumanist  humans would explore space for enlightenment  rather than becoming post humans  i almost suspect the federation itself would have some anti eugenics feature in its constitution that said  the rejection of genetic engineering and transhumanism was in a context in which eugenics was embraced broadly beforehand  hints from trek and my sense of roddenberry s attitudes makes me think that there was eugenics in trek that is  trek features  liberal eugenics   this is where all eugenics is done individually and not institutionally  and it is done in the context of a human relationship producing a child out of love you would have a fence of law built around eugenics  but within that fence technology would be applied to the absolute limit  first of all  picking the best fruit    where a woman s eggs and a man s sperm are harvested and surveyed and the man and woman can choose which combination of their own genes is preferred second  mate selection based on genetic profiles third  epigenetic management  engineering everything except for the genes  fourth  things like best practices for nutrition and child development to unlock the full potential of a person s genetic baseline when people date  they d check genetic profiles as casually as people today talk about whether they want to raise kids in the city or the country  a person who loves music might want to find a gifted musician to have kids with but this is all liberalized  so nothing is force  there are no rules to it and you can do ultimately what you want  however  there is effectively a eugenic program in the society my evidence for this   and it s more of a roddenberry conceit   is that season 1 episode with the child who has calculus homework clearly roddenberry is implying a few things by this  educational methods will be  that good  in the future  half of why mankind is more mature  maybe starfleet are the best of the best  so smart even their kids are natural geniuses however  i think   given roddenberry s very casual and open attitudes about sexual liberalization and how we should shed certain inhibitions and the idea of techno progressivism   that roddenberry is implying that people themselves are smarter and better in the future  that this isn t transhumanist  which they back then called  eugenics    but rather natural  which is implicitly eugenecist anyway  i like to sometimes think about the elements of the future in trek that we take for granted  like no money  and how it might work a lot differently than we think  after all  if we knew how it worked  we d do it already  the whole point is they ve figured some things out that we haven t  that s why it s the future even so  the question of liberal eugenics is interested  once cultural stigmas wane  there s no reason not to do it  on the other hand  eugenics is a concession that some  kinds  of children are more valuable than other  kinds   that will play in poorly to social divisions and structural inequities we aren t mature enough yet to engage in eugenics with a liberal spirit  we ll use it to embed our imperfections  in this sense  eugenics is paradoxical  it s the quest for a more perfect version of our imperfect selves eugenics wars   i think there are still eugenics in the future

Now, one of the things that annoy most fans of a franchise as long running as the Trekverse is the continuity errors. 

And the change in tone of each show – in this same reddit, and almost every place where fans congregate, you can find declarations that DS9/VOY/DIS/ENT/Whatever “just isn’t real Trek.” Me, for instance, loved DS9 for its plot and writing, but don’t want to imagine Federation’s dark sides. (Said dark sides shot upto eleven during Picard, so much that I quit watching that one.) 

One possible explanation – Parallel Universes.

We saw in Parallels that thousands of universes, with much the same individuals, exist at the same time, with their own differences based on individual choices. Each show and each Movie Series  is from a different parallel universe – each universe has/had a Kirk/Picard/Janeway and their teams, but each universe also has subtle differences, different choices.  The TOS universe is not the same as TNG one, the DS9 universe is not the same as the VOY one, the movies are not set in the same universe as the shows, and so on.

So in one universe Federation remained the Knight In Shining Armor, in another it took a level in jerkass, in one universe Data lived long enough to be an admiral, in another he died in Nemesis, in one Universe Picard was disillusioned and broken, in another he is still with the more or less idealist Federation, and so on.

That, at least, is my headcanon.

Kinda like Quantum Leap, which a guy on this reddit mentioned and I think was good theory. Or that Wharf was assimilating his dimension counterparts? Clone copy type thing, I don't like this theory but why would Troi say, ""If you make it back probably I won't get my Wharf back."" Why? Why would she say this.

2. The ending. Rarely I see it talked about. The ending, there is no party, which subtly suggests he is not in original dimension at all.

0,During their war with the federation in the 2250s they massacred entire civilian populations.  They murdered hundreds of thousands if not millions of people.  There is no honor in massacring those who can't defend themselves.  So I would say many klingons have no honor.  That doesn't mean there aren't those who do have honor.  Worf thought he massacred a ship full of civilians.  And he clearly felt remorse about it.  Someone like worf would not attack a defenseless opponent.  But there are many klingons who would.  And I would say that they have no honor.  So what you have is an empire of warriors.  Many who claim to have honor but really don't.  Without honor they are just an empire of savages.  Who glorify war for its' own sake.  Instead of using it to defend higher ideals.  Anyway so let me know what you think in the comments.,Klingons have no honor,during their war with the federation in the 2250s they massacred entire civilian populations   they murdered hundreds of thousands if not millions of people   there is no honor in massacring those who can t defend themselves   so i would say many klingons have no honor   that doesn t mean there aren t those who do have honor   worf thought he massacred a ship full of civilians   and he clearly felt remorse about it   someone like worf would not attack a defenseless opponent   but there are many klingons who would   and i would say that they have no honor   so what you have is an empire of warriors   many who claim to have honor but really don t   without honor they are just an empire of savages   who glorify war for its  own sake   instead of using it to defend higher ideals   anyway so let me know what you think in the comments klingons have no honor

Try and follow me on this. The concept of the Multiverse is based on the idea that for every choice there is a reality that stems from that choice. Actions and consequences. Other names and/or depictions of this concept include alternate timelines, dimensions, realities, etc. Much like with the plot of “Steins Gate” anime which is based on the “World Line Theory” 

Now, the federation universe is fundamentally different than the mirror universe because essentially the entire universe is different. Almost polar opposites. Following the Worldline theory each universe belongs to a separate “attractor fields” because event took place that was so significant that it changed the entire reality of that universe to diverge from the federation universe. In the mirror universe “Terrans” are violent conquerors whom have spread throughout the alpha quadrant enslaving, destroying and generally conquering every world they came across. The Federation universe works much the same way but only in a peaceful manner where humans venture out in an exploration manner with friendly intent and curiosity which ultimately gives birth to the federation of planets.  

Our only point of reference here where the universes go separate paths is during first contact. However, in the scene where Zefram Cochrane is to meet the Vulcans as you see in Star Trek Enterprise it is almost as if they had been expecting aliens to visit them. Almost as if they knew aliens were out there. Zefram Cochrane believed that the Vulcans were would-be invaders, so he killed them and raided their ship. Why would he think that especially when they were showing peaceful intent? 

Enter Nog. In DS9 the episode “Little Green Men” Nog, Quark, and Rom end up crashing on earth in the far past. It was like the 50’s-60’s era. I suppose the fault wouldn’t solely land on Nog since his uncle Quark was posing attempting to sell future technology to the Americans with a threat to sell to their competitors instead which lead to suspicion of their circumstances. Ultimately it was Nog whom laid the final brick in that when he attempted to bluff by telling them they were an advanced scout for an invasion fleet. Humans, specifically Americans were very suspicious people at the time due to the Russian threat so to plant the seed of doubt in their minds about friendly alien life could have lasted throughout the ages until first contact. 

Considering all that I have said. The Theory stands that Nog is the cause and thus creator of the mirror universe.  Because he created a reality changing event that shaped the future so dramatically that it split the universe into 2 separate universes. One where humans were friendly and curious about the galaxy, and one where humans were xenophobic and mistrustful of all alien life resulting in their conquering nature.",Mirror Universe theory,  try and follow me on this  the concept of the multiverse is based on the idea that for every choice there is a reality that stems from that choice  actions and consequences  other names and or depictions of this concept include alternate timelines  dimensions  realities  etc  much like with the plot of  steins gate  anime which is based on the  world line theory  now  the federation universe is fundamentally different than the mirror universe because essentially the entire universe is different  almost polar opposites  following the worldline theory each universe belongs to a separate  attractor fields  because event took place that was so significant that it changed the entire reality of that universe to diverge from the federation universe  in the mirror universe  terrans  are violent conquerors whom have spread throughout the alpha quadrant enslaving  destroying and generally conquering every world they came across  the federation universe works much the same way but only in a peaceful manner where humans venture out in an exploration manner with friendly intent and curiosity which ultimately gives birth to the federation of planets   our only point of reference here where the universes go separate paths is during first contact  however  in the scene where zefram cochrane is to meet the vulcans as you see in star trek enterprise it is almost as if they had been expecting aliens to visit them  almost as if they knew aliens were out there  zefram cochrane believed that the vulcans were would be invaders  so he killed them and raided their ship  why would he think that especially when they were showing peaceful intent  enter nog  in ds9 the episode  little green men  nog  quark  and rom end up crashing on earth in the far past  it was like the 50 s 60 s era  i suppose the fault wouldn t solely land on nog since his uncle quark was posing attempting to sell future technology to the americans with a threat to sell to their competitors instead which lead to suspicion of their circumstances  ultimately it was nog whom laid the final brick in that when he attempted to bluff by telling them they were an advanced scout for an invasion fleet  humans  specifically americans were very suspicious people at the time due to the russian threat so to plant the seed of doubt in their minds about friendly alien life could have lasted throughout the ages until first contact  considering all that i have said  the theory stands that nog is the cause and thus creator of the mirror universe   because he created a reality changing event that shaped the future so dramatically that it split the universe into 2 separate universes  one where humans were friendly and curious about the galaxy  and one where humans were xenophobic and mistrustful of all alien life resulting in their conquering nature mirror universe theory

0,"In Star Trek, there are many races, if the borg designation system is anything to go by, then there 10,000 ish different species out there, but i know there are some trek fans out there whom could append certain personality traits and quirks to certain races, and I thought it would be interesting to se what race/s people append to my own personality, so, I'll list the trait/quirk of me and maybe a short summary of it, and see what races people append to my personality.

Here goes, I'll start with the good traits/quirks:


Honesty: I truly believe thatone should always be honest, no matter the consequenses.

Logical: I will openly admit that I am definately a man of logic.

Reasonable: I CAN get hot headed from time to time, but I'm not one for doing domething unreasonable.

Proud: This I can see as both a good thing and a bad thing, but in a good way, I feel a sense of pride more often then not after acomplishing something that I believe to be significant.

Humble: I hate toting myself off like the best thing since sliced cheese, If anything I think people overestimate my abilities.

Loyal: I NEVER turn my back on a friend or family member unless they have done something I cannot forgive them for.

Understanding: I am nothing if not willing to pay attention and understand others problems.

Kind: I do think my kindness might lead to my death eventually, but I can't help it, nothing feels better than showing someone a little kindness.

Caring: This trait reinforces alot of my particular gripes about society and the state our world is in.

Tolerant: It is very hard to get me all rilled up, simple as that.

Univerality/Keeping things the same: I do love to keep things to just one thing, I despise Competition like it's the bubonic plague.

Adaptability: To some degree I am adaptable, but in others, I am not.

Lack of Individuality/Drone/Everyone the same: While I DO agree that if everyone was the same the world would be very boring, but i would rather live in a boring, peaceful world than a diverse, chaotic one.

Anti-Capitalist/Pro-Communist: I despise Capitalism and the people who accept it, and I fully support Communism(and no Russia was never true Communism, I suggest you read the Communist Manifesto by Carl Marxx before you go giving Communism any flac)

Honourable: I am a man with much, much honour.

Go-Getter: When something needs doing that I know needs doing, I will go do it.

Anti-Warring: I truly believe that wars are wasteful, illogical, unreasonable and unwanted.

Misanthropic: Because of the fact that society refuses to change for the better(aka go back to how society was in the 80's and 90's), my hatred of society is quite immense.

Philantropic: I believe that the world CAN change for the better, and it falls onto those with large sums of money to make that change happen, sadly.

Wise: I have those moments where someone asks me for some life advice and I lay on some words of wisdom.

Nostalgic: I love the past, I hate the present, I am hopeful for the future.

Reliable: I can always be counted on to get something done that needs to be done.



Now the bad traits/quirks

Arrogant: I wouldnt say I'm fully arrogant, but there are things I will flat refuse to accept for one reason or another.

Pride: I admit, at times pride does blind me, but without pride, I could never survive.

Anger: I'm not quick to anger, nor easy to anger, but when I do get angry I become very vocal, fortunately I am not owtwardly aggressive.

Regretful/Remorsefull: I hate my past and would desperatly love to change it.

Jealous: Mostly when it comes to women, if I see a beautiful woman attached to another man and not me, I do die inside.

Vengeful: Only towards one guy from my past, but if you push me that far over the edge and yeah, I become quite vengeful.

Lazy: Oh yeah, guilty as charged.

Paranoid: I'm always looking over my shoulder, afraid of getting stabbed in the back for no reason.

Emotional: Emotions are illogical, unreasonable and as human history has shown, it too unpredictable, Emotions should always be suppressed, although sadly for me my attempts to supress my emotions backfire very miserably, anger being the one that is the worst, having supressed my anger for nearly 26 years(I was 27 at time of writing), and now bottling up my anger only causes it to burst out worse, for an example, if say someone is trying to antagonise me on purpose and were pushing me till I snapped, my first instict would be to beat the ever beloved shit out of them till they were on the ground unconsious, but instead I try to bottle up that anger knowing that letting it out won't do any good, and instead I beat the shit out them untill they died, so yeah Anger is one emotion I have sadly learned that bottling up will only lead to something worse, Humans make very illogical decisions all based on their emotions, not by logic.

0,"So my theory is that the ancient Hebitian people on Cardassia Prime were actually lost Bajoran colonists.

We know that Bajoran civilization began to flourish “more than five hundred thousand years ago”, which is 100 times longer than Human civilisation has been around, this implies that while the ancient Bajorans were renowned for their accomplishments in science, mathematics, philosophy, and the arts, as a species they developed very slowly compared to other species as they had only just achieved warp the year the Cardassian invasion started (presumably a contributing factor, with the Cardassians potentially being afraid they would lose influence to the Bajorans).

This means that it’s possible that the Bajorans could have been stuck with sunlight technology for hundreds of not thousands of years with the solar sails being a later generation of this, presumably the Bajorans had thousands of years of space exploration if humans have been exploring space of sorts for 500 years.

The Hebitians, the first civilisation on Cardassia only emerged about 10,000 years before 2376, hundreds of thousands of years after the Bajoran civilisation had emerged, so my theory is that about 10,000 prior to DS9, the Bajorans experimented with sunlight generational ships attempting to settle people in nearby worlds, the first attempt at these ships was thought lost when they stumbled upon tachyon eddies, which accelerated their lightships beyond the speed of light and enabled them to reach the neighbouring Cardassian system. Crash landing in the desert world they established a new civilisation, the Hebitian civilisation and somehow, perhaps through genetic engineering, they became cold blooded “reptilians” perfectly adapted to live in a hot desert environment.

There is actually some evidence that could support this, first is the fact that Bajorans and Cardassians are the only two species in the entire franchise that we know can reproduce naturally without any medical intervention, binary cloning or genetic tampering at all, which is shown or implied to be needed for every other hybrid species (this lead to a theory that the two species are somehow the same which forms the basic premise of this theory), it’s never explicitly stated so it might not be, but it is very likely the Bajoran-Cardassian hybrids are fertile. This fits the common definition of being the same species which implies that even after the alterations that lead to the Cardassians different appearance and adaptations, the robust genetics remains the same.

The ancient humanoids are not an explanation for the ability for the two species to naturally reproduce, as I previously stated other specieslile Humans and Vulcans are shown to require a lot of medical intervention to combine the DNA and even then it’s quite rare, the species only have a common ancestor in a single cells amoeba, that’s like expecting a Human and a Banana to naturally reproduce.

There is also the fact that the Hebitians were described as being an agrarian society as well as farmers, scientists and artists, exactly like the Bajorans were before the occupation.

At one point the Hebitians feel and the militaristic Cardassian civilisation replaced it, yet genetically they were still the same species, the Cardassians grew a deep hatred for the Hebitians and tried to eradicate all traces of their culture from Cardassia Prime, perhaps this lead to an unconscious cultural bias against the Bajorans or perhaps the Cardassians had discovered the Hebitians were actually Bajorans and destroyed all traces of them to cover it up as it would have negated the belief they were the “superior species”.

There are a few holes in this theory, being that if Bajorans were capable of building and launching ships 10,000 years ago, how exactly the Bajorans came to look like Cardassians and the exact reason for destroying any traces of the Hebitians, but if we fill in the blanks, the theory would actually make a lot of sense. I have tried to give some examples to fill in the blanks such as the potential genetic engineering to tailor the colonists to a desert environment.

Ignoring the Ancient Humanoids seeding life on planets throughout the galaxy (not relevant to the theory), what are the chances that two intelligent Humanoid species would evolve in neighbouring star systems, develop similar cultures and be magically genetically similar enough to be able to produce fertile offspring naturally?",Hebitians are Bajorans,so my theory is that the ancient hebitian people on cardassia prime were actually lost bajoran colonists we know that bajoran civilization began to flourish  more than five hundred thousand years ago   which is 100 times longer than human civilisation has been around  this implies that while the ancient bajorans were renowned for their accomplishments in science  mathematics  philosophy  and the arts  as a species they developed very slowly compared to other species as they had only just achieved warp the year the cardassian invasion started  presumably a contributing factor  with the cardassians potentially being afraid they would lose influence to the bajorans  this means that it s possible that the bajorans could have been stuck with sunlight technology for hundreds of not thousands of years with the solar sails being a later generation of this  presumably the bajorans had thousands of years of space exploration if humans have been exploring space of sorts for 500 years the hebitians  the first civilisation on cardassia only emerged about 10 000 years before 2376  hundreds of thousands of years after the bajoran civilisation had emerged  so my theory is that about 10 000 prior to ds9  the bajorans experimented with sunlight generational ships attempting to settle people in nearby worlds  the first attempt at these ships was thought lost when they stumbled upon tachyon eddies  which accelerated their lightships beyond the speed of light and enabled them to reach the neighbouring cardassian system  crash landing in the desert world they established a new civilisation  the hebitian civilisation and somehow  perhaps through genetic engineering  they became cold blooded  reptilians  perfectly adapted to live in a hot desert environment there is actually some evidence that could support this  first is the fact that bajorans and cardassians are the only two species in the entire franchise that we know can reproduce naturally without any medical intervention  binary cloning or genetic tampering at all  which is shown or implied to be needed for every other hybrid species  this lead to a theory that the two species are somehow the same which forms the basic premise of this theory   it s never explicitly stated so it might not be  but it is very likely the bajoran cardassian hybrids are fertile  this fits the common definition of being the same species which implies that even after the alterations that lead to the cardassians different appearance and adaptations  the robust genetics remains the same the ancient humanoids are not an explanation for the ability for the two species to naturally reproduce  as i previously stated other specieslile humans and vulcans are shown to require a lot of medical intervention to combine the dna and even then it s quite rare  the species only have a common ancestor in a single cells amoeba  that s like expecting a human and a banana to naturally reproduce there is also the fact that the hebitians were described as being an agrarian society as well as farmers  scientists and artists  exactly like the bajorans were before the occupation at one point the hebitians feel and the militaristic cardassian civilisation replaced it  yet genetically they were still the same species  the cardassians grew a deep hatred for the hebitians and tried to eradicate all traces of their culture from cardassia prime  perhaps this lead to an unconscious cultural bias against the bajorans or perhaps the cardassians had discovered the hebitians were actually bajorans and destroyed all traces of them to cover it up as it would have negated the belief they were the  superior species  there are a few holes in this theory  being that if bajorans were capable of building and launching ships 10 000 years ago  how exactly the bajorans came to look like cardassians and the exact reason for destroying any traces of the hebitians  but if we fill in the blanks  the theory would actually make a lot of sense  i have tried to give some examples to fill in the blanks such as the potential genetic engineering to tailor the colonists to a desert environment ignoring the ancient humanoids seeding life on planets throughout the galaxy  not relevant to the theory   what are the chances that two intelligent humanoid species would evolve in neighbouring star systems  develop similar cultures and be magically genetically similar enough to be able to produce fertile offspring naturally hebitians are bajorans

Star Trek Discovery isn’t bad because of the casting or diversity, it’s bad because of the writing and character decisions. All this “forced diversity” is just “diversity” but with an extra word added. It’s all about the writing imo. They could cast an old black guy and write him so bad and people would dislike it. Writing is important in a show as big as Star Trek. Sexuality and Diversity has always been in the franchise as a whole, you cannot discredit a show for wanting to do it more. 

The effort of writing is where the struggle for the characters come in, your interest in their struggles because that’s what makes a person ‘human’, audiences respond to fear and levels of self doubt and the character development allows all that to flourish when characters grow, if a character (or characters) are already strong then what’s the point there is absolutely no way of riding around the development because they end up as a blank slate (aka BatWoman, example: Kate Kane literally showed up to Gotham with no combat experience and demanded her suit regardless of the fact she never had any fighting or combat experience just like Bruce Wayne did, Bruce always trained yet she didn’t and she’s hardly comparable in size)

Next is the approach to handling diversity is important, you don’t wanna hammer every alphabet in there or race otherwise fans will notice and start to realise it only exists to preach to the audience, there are reasons BatWoman did so horribly no one not even the “sjws” wanted it but it’s quite strange they were all for it until the show began, the ratings dropped and they will continue to so unless they scrap their writers room and get someone who can handle better writing and a less-self indulgent show runner.",Star Trek Discovery is ehhh...,thoughts on star trek discovery star trek discovery isn t bad because of the casting or diversity  it s bad because of the writing and character decisions  all this  forced diversity  is just  diversity  but with an extra word added  it s all about the writing imo  they could cast an old black guy and write him so bad and people would dislike it  writing is important in a show as big as star trek  sexuality and diversity has always been in the franchise as a whole  you cannot discredit a show for wanting to do it more  the effort of writing is where the struggle for the characters come in  your interest in their struggles because that s what makes a person  human   audiences respond to fear and levels of self doubt and the character development allows all that to flourish when characters grow  if a character  or characters  are already strong then what s the point there is absolutely no way of riding around the development because they end up as a blank slate  aka batwoman  example  kate kane literally showed up to gotham with no combat experience and demanded her suit regardless of the fact she never had any fighting or combat experience just like bruce wayne did  bruce always trained yet she didn t and she s hardly comparable in size next is the approach to handling diversity is important  you don t wanna hammer every alphabet in there or race otherwise fans will notice and start to realise it only exists to preach to the audience  there are reasons batwoman did so horribly no one not even the  sjws  wanted it but it s quite strange they were all for it until the show began  the ratings dropped and they will continue to so unless they scrap their writers room and get someone who can handle better writing and a less self indulgent show runner star trek discovery is ehhh   
0,"So, I'm amongst the many people whose eyes rolled *hard* at the seeming revelation in last week's episode that a child's tantrum caused the burn and, ultimately, the deconstruction of the entire galaxy. I remain hopeful that this is a misdirect, and somehow there'll be a more satisfying explanation, but I thought it might be fun to spitball some ideas to see what creative minds we have in the sub, and to see if we could come up with a more satisfying solution than we've seen so far.

I'll start off with a possibility that I've put together. I'm taking it from the beginning of the last episode, and keeping everything pretty much the same up until that point. Personally, I'd have been disappointed if it did end up being a Q or something like that because, again, it would feel to me that Discovery is just leaning on nostalgia and not standing on its own two feet.

So, the way I would have played out events is as follows. Discovery follows the distress signal to the same location, the nebula, and they still find the dilithium nursery planet inside. We know from previous episodes that there were experiments going on to tackle the growing scarcity of dilithium, and we find out that the site where the burn began was due to another experiment - someone (maybe even the Kelpien scientist) had developed a spore drive.

Unfortunately, they ran into similar problems that Discovery and her sister ship did early on - they didn't have a navigator. When they activated, they were pulled into the dilithium nursery, and this triggered a cataclysmic reaction that travelled back along the mycelial network, rendering most other dilithium inert, since it's connected to everything in the galaxy. At this point, you could have Stamets explain that, when he's been navigating the network, he always felt a pull towards certain places, and hadn't considered that they might be places containing massive amounts of dilithium before.

Now, you could still have Osyraa taking over the ship with this plot, but she DOESN'T know that Stamets is the navigator, and so you have the struggle of trying to convince her not to do a jump/outright trying to stop her so that you have the tension going forward. 

This gets resolved through various stuff (haven't figured this bit out), and eventually all is resolved. Stamets mentioned that it's not just those coordinates he's felt drawn to within the network, and therefore it's realised that he's able to seek out these dilithium nurseries, thereby resolving the shortage and helping to start bring the Federation back together again (instead of Burnham saving the day for a change!).

Any other ideas?",Discovery Season 3 - How would you have written it?,so  i m amongst the many people whose eyes rolled  hard  at the seeming revelation in last week s episode that a child s tantrum caused the burn and  ultimately  the deconstruction of the entire galaxy  i remain hopeful that this is a misdirect  and somehow there ll be a more satisfying explanation  but i thought it might be fun to spitball some ideas to see what creative minds we have in the sub  and to see if we could come up with a more satisfying solution than we ve seen so far i ll start off with a possibility that i ve put together  i m taking it from the beginning of the last episode  and keeping everything pretty much the same up until that point  personally  i d have been disappointed if it did end up being a q or something like that because  again  it would feel to me that discovery is just leaning on nostalgia and not standing on its own two feet so  the way i would have played out events is as follows  discovery follows the distress signal to the same location  the nebula  and they still find the dilithium nursery planet inside  we know from previous episodes that there were experiments going on to tackle the growing scarcity of dilithium  and we find out that the site where the burn began was due to another experiment   someone  maybe even the kelpien scientist  had developed a spore drive unfortunately  they ran into similar problems that discovery and her sister ship did early on   they didn t have a navigator  when they activated  they were pulled into the dilithium nursery  and this triggered a cataclysmic reaction that travelled back along the mycelial network  rendering most other dilithium inert  since it s connected to everything in the galaxy  at this point  you could have stamets explain that  when he s been navigating the network  he always felt a pull towards certain places  and hadn t considered that they might be places containing massive amounts of dilithium before now  you could still have osyraa taking over the ship with this plot  but she doesn t know that stamets is the navigator  and so you have the struggle of trying to convince her not to do a jump outright trying to stop her so that you have the tension going forward  this gets resolved through various stuff  haven t figured this bit out   and eventually all is resolved  stamets mentioned that it s not just those coordinates he s felt drawn to within the network  and therefore it s realised that he s able to seek out these dilithium nurseries  thereby resolving the shortage and helping to start bring the federation back together again  instead of burnham saving the day for a change   any other ideas discovery season 3   how would you have written it 
0,"I was thinking conceptually about what a bridge-duty Science officer aboard an exploration cruiser like the Enterprise D might look like and how they would function.  Spock's role aboard the TOS Enterprise wasn't directly revisited and Data more-less was Ops/Science officer, whereas DS9 had Dax and Voyager had Samantha Wildman.

0,"(I tried asking this before, but I think my comparison to a non-Star Trek work distracted people from the actual request.) 

I've seen every Star Trek film and every episode of every Star Trek series ... except *Lower Decks*, which I started this afternoon! I've watched some of the Trek series all the way through multiple times.

A common thing about the Trek films &amp; series is that they all are told from the perspective of Starfleet personnel. *Star Trek: Picard* toys a little with being non-Starfleet ... but, of course, the title character is about as Starfleet as you can get.

However, I have grown a bit tired of the Starfleet perspective, so I'm looking for content in the Trek universe that's different. 

Since I've already seen *all* the films &amp; TV series, can you recommend *other* Star Trek works (i.e., books, comics, games, really good fan fiction or fan series) with the following characteristics: 

* Set in the Trek universe
* *Not* episodes/seasons/installments of any of the existing canon Star Trek series or films (since I've already seen them all)
* Most importantly, tells stories from the perspective of *non-Starfleet* characters

I'm hoping to find stories in the Trek universe that represent something other than the mission and perspective of Starfleet and it's personnel. I want to experience the perspective of the other inhabitants of the Trek universe -- the ones who don't live in a Federation ship/base/academy. Bonus points for content about the dark underbelly of the Trek universe.

0,"I recently finished watching Enterprise - and I really, really enjoyed it. Much better show than anyone gives it credit for. Obviously I was not a fan of the ending for all the reasons I think anyone could imagine. 

But that made me start thinking about how other Trek series have ended. Did a rewatch of the Voyager finale last night - I think i’ve seen it 4 or 5 times now - and it’s the first time i’ve ever wondered “was this a good finale for this show?” I have no problem about them finally getting back to the Alpha Quadrant but I kept thinking 

“Does this ending work for this show?”

I think my big issue is Admiral Janeway explicitly calling her past self out for destroying the caretaker’s array. I’m sure every fan has their own feelings on it, I know I do, but I certainly believe that Janeway’s actions for the rest of the series strengthen the point she was trying to make by rejecting the array: That the values of starfleet are important and worth struggling for. 

And then you’ve got Admiral Janeway sayings “No, I don’t really think they are. Not how me and my crew struggled.” the finale deals with this quickly by having captain janeway pushback and deus ex borging the admiral out of of the story....but I’ve still got wonder.

0,"First a quick disclaimer I like Discovery generally and I am not trying to bash it but I found this odd.  In the original ""Mirror Mirror"" the mirror universe was presented as a type of funhouse mirror image of the prime universe.  Despite the clear differences between the two universes: an evil Terran Empire as opposed to a peaceful Federation, the term Mirror made sense for everyone was still the same.  Captain Kirk was the Captain of the Enterprise in both universes.  Spock was still the first officer, Scotty the chief engineer for both as well.  Uhura, Sulu, Chekov almost everyone down the line was still doing the same thing their counterparts were in prime universe.  Dr. McCoy managed to spill acid in the same place in both realties.    

On Discovery however it is different.   Philippa Georgiou is the Captain of the Shenzhou. Her fate is she is killed and eaten by Klingons.  In the mirror  Philippa Georgiou is Emperor of the Terran Empire, has conquered the Klingons, and eats Kelpiens.

Michael Burnham was at the start of the series first officer of the Shenzhou before her fall.  In the mirror was the Shenzhou's captain and heiress apparent to the Empire.

Sylvia Tilly at the start of the series was a Starfleet cadet while her mirror counterpart was the Captain of the Discovery.

0,"Spoilers for Discovery Season 3x11 below. 

First, I know I won't be covering any new ground, so I apologize.  But I've become frustrated with a thing I love, Star Trek, and think venting might make me feel better. 

Second, I am 40 years old and have been a Star Trek fan all my life. I remember being teased for it in elementary school, hiding it in high school (and beyond), going to conventions in the 90s, and starting for hours at Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise and the Enterpise D Technical manual.  I have watched all of it, and mostly love all of it.  (My opinions on the Kelvin Universe are a separate rambling post).

My rant:  I have enjoyed Discovery for most of its run so far. I have the same criticisms I think most of us have and clearly see the show's flaws. The frantic pace of the first two seasons, the awkward storytelling, making Michael the center of the universe, etc., but the most recent episode is the first time I've felt close to giving up (I obviously won't, but I hate feeling like this). 

-I hate Ensign Tilly being Number One (As much as I hate Pine's Kirk being ""acting captain""), but I understand the showrunners like the actor and character, so I've tried to go with it.  She did a good job in the role, but she was a cadet one season ago, and there are more experienced officers available.  It's beyond absurd watching it in action.    

-Stamets trying to prevent Hugh from going on the mission was strange, awkward to watch, and makes no sense.  They're both professional Star Fleet officers!  It's what they signed up for.  Plus, it's far from the most dangerous mission we've seen a character go on.  I didn't understand it.  We already know they love each other.  

-The Adira and Gray subplot is pointless.  Him going away maybe helped develop Adira's character somewhat, but we find out he went away for...reasons, and now he's back for...other reasons?  His return was out of place in this episode and felt forced.  I like the character Adira, but could have passed on Gray coming back.  

-Also, have we established that people can just beam through shields?  What was the point of upgrading Discovery with 31st-century tech?  

-Finally, and maybe most importantly, making the Burn be an emotional alien we've never heard of feels like a slap in the face.  I know we've seen Gary Mitchell and other hyper-powerful beings in Star Trek before, but this is a season-long arc.  Maybe it'll be better in the final two episodes, but this is rough.  Why do writers of things we love feel the need to ""subvert expectations"" so much?  GoT and Star Wars sequels anybody??  This could have been the omega particle.  And somehow fixed by Discovery's spore drive.  Keep the rest of the season arcs and get rid of the exploding dilithium planet, and come up with some way Discovery has to risk itself to save the future of the Federation.  I don't know.  I'm not a paid writer.

0,"Over the holiday, I've binged both *Star Trek: Discovery* and *Star Wars: The Mandalorian*. (I know, I know, bear with me: this is a Trek question ultimately.) 

I'm struck by the difference between the ST and SW universes (not a new revelation, of course). Trek is Roddenberry's post-scarcity, shiny, positive outlook for the future. While in George Lucas's world, the good guys also eventually win (sorry if that's a spoiler; get over it), the Star Wars stories don't hesitate to dive into the seedy side of its universe (rogues, smugglers^1 , bounty hunters, junk dealers, slavery, criminals, etc.) in a way that rarely occurs with Star Trek and its focus on the, frankly, goody two-shoes Federation crews.

(Initially I was excited that *Star Trek: Picard* seemed to be going a different way in the first few episodes, but it swung back to typical Star Trek morality play-style by the end of Season 1.) The &gt;!Terran Empire and Section 31!&lt; injected a little welcome intrigue and moral ambiguity into Season 2 of *Discovery*, but not as much as I would have liked. 

So the question. I've seen all the series and films now (except for *Lower Decks*, which is up next in my queue), but I haven't explored much outside the films &amp; TV shows. **Are there *any* Star Trek works (books, comics, games, etc. ... maybe even really good fan fiction?) that (a) are set in the Trek universe, but (b) don't tell stories about a Federation ship and its crew and (c) deal with the grittier side of the Star Trek universe?**

0,"Oh my god, and I thought I felt empty inside when I finished TNG! I had heard great things about DS9 for years, and just from the bits I did hear, I knew it was probably going to be my favorite Star Trek series. While I've only finished TOS and TNG, I think it's safe for me to say that I was right, and that DS9 is my absolute favorite. I think the best indicator for how much I enjoyed it is this: It took me around a year, maybe a year and a half to finish TOS. I took me two years to finish TNG. It took me around two months to finish DS9. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love TOS and TNG, and also probably has something to do with the former two's heavier episodic focus, but I just couldn't get enough of DS9.

While I did miss the episodic, exploration focused style of TNG, I think DS9 more than made up for it with how well it handled its characters and story. This was easily my favorite cast of characters in Star Trek, and I don't see them being topped. Each one of them were so interesting and layered, and had excellent development throughout (shout out to Kira for being my favorite character, and my second favorite Star Trek character period). Even the minor characters were amazing, to the point where I'd say I like Damar, Nog, Weyoun, Rom, and Martok just as much, and in some cases more than, some main cast members in previous Star Trek's. And theit relationships were so great, it even gave the best bromance ever! This is seriously one of the greatest casts I've ever had the joy of experiencing in media.

And the stories were excellent. Many of the episodic adventures were amazing, easily just as good, if not better than the best of TNG, and when the sequential episodes were fantastic, and really showed that Star Trek could work in different formats than just the typical episodic structure. 

I also have to applaud it for being the most consistent show. TOS has it's very underwhelming third season, TNG has a rocky start, and while the last two seasons are great, I felt as though the consistency was starting to dip a bit. DS9, however was great from beginning to end, if anything, it only gets bettter. I think I've heard that people aren't too fond of the first season, and while I agree that it was the weakest one and you could tell that they were finding their footing, I honestly thought it was pretty good, probably around the same level of quality as TNG S6 and 7, maybe a bit lower. 

I also want to tackle some more spoiler heavy topics, mainly concerning stuff that I either have issues with or am just a bit mixed on, so I'll go into those now:

&gt;!Might as well start with Dukat. What an amazing villain! At first, I didn't understand why people loved him, and then I watched Neccessary Evil, and it all became clear. However, I know some people do not like the direction his character went after Sacrifice of Angels. Personally, I like it, but I do admit that I liked pre-breakdown Dukat a good bit more than post-breakdown Dukat. Like, I think it makes sense story and character-wise, especially when the Pah Wraiths really come into the mix, and I do think that they needed to either get rid of Dukat or do something new with him after SoA, and he's still an enjoyable character and villain, but I do enjoy him when he's more of a complex character, rather than a raving mad man out for revenge. He's still a good character, just different and simpler.!&lt;

&gt;!Speaking of the Pah Wraiths, I'm not really sure what to make of them. They work as a way to create conflict in order to give the whole Prophets plotline an ending, but they just sort of felt...I guess segmented from everything else, especially near the end. That last showdown with Sisko and Dukat wasn't bad, but rather than an plotline that felt as if it were as equal to the Dominion War in terms of importance, it felt more like the story went ""Oh wait, one more thing!"" and quickly took care of it. I guess I can sum my thoughts up as I think it was a good idea that could have been integrated better. Oh yeah, and Kai Win, almost forgot about her. Again, I think her character arc in s7 made sense, but it was over a bit too quick for me and was too isolated from everything else!&lt;

&gt;!I am definitely not a fan of the Odo and Kira romance, never got why they kept pushing it in that direction. Okay, I kinda get it for Odo, but not Kira, especially after how he acted when the Dominion took over DS9. I loved their friendship, I think they worked great as friends, but as lovers? I'm sorry, I don't buy Kira having romantic feelings for a guy who has done, and believes in, some very sketchy things that go against her beliefs and values.!&lt;

&gt;!Jadzia is the character who grew on me the most, going from a character that I didn't have any strong feelings towards at all, to one I really liked. I knew her death was coming (I don't remember how I got spoiled, I think I looked up the cast or something and got spoiled that way), but it still got to me. Not the biggest fan of how it was handled, and from what I've heard from the BtS stuff, I'm disappointed in why it happened, but I think killing off a main character worked for DS9, and it being the one who could technically come back made for some interesting stories. I like Ezri, and I think they did a good job at integrating her with only one season left, but I admit, throughout s7 I kept thinking ""I miss Jadzia"" and ""I wonder what this scene would be like if it where Jadzia instead"". Again, I like them both though.!&lt;

&gt;!To end the spoiler section on a positive note, I really have to give credit to how the handled Damar, because wow, I am honestly surprised with how well the handled him, and how much I like him as a character. I honestly thought he would just be some minor grunt who I would like, but not think much of, but his development from a grunt, to a miserable, drunk who reluctantly serves the Dominion, to a revolutionary who leads his people to freedom was just perfect. And to have him come to some level of understanding when it comes to how horriblethe Bajoran occupation was through the Dominion occupation of Cardassia was fantastic, and again demonstrates how nuanced Star Trek, and DS9 especially can be when it comes to writing. It doesn't absolve him of all the horrible things he had done, but it does show that even someone like Damar has the capacity to grow, and I truly think that if he had lived, that he would have tried to repent for the Bajoran Occupation in someway. Again, doesn't absolve him, but at least it shows that he had the capacity to be a better man. I seriously just love Damar as a character, he's one of my top favorite Star Trek characters.!&lt;

I feel like I said everything I needed to, and I expect that I haven't said anything that hasn't already been discussed many times, but I hope you've enjoyed my excited rambling. Deep Space Nine was truly something special, and it has become something that I will hold with me forever. Now to watch What We Left Behind, and then onto Voyager! I know that from here on out, things get more contentious, but I'm going to go into Voyager with an open mind and a positive attitude, and hopefully come out the other end satisfied. 

And as one last note to end on, I thought I'd give my (tenative) Top 10 episodes, in no specific order: Neccessary Evil, The Visitor, Far Beyond the Stars, In the Pale Moonlight, Tacking Into the Wind, Rocks and Shoals, The Die is Cast, Civil Defense, It's Only a Paper Moon, and What You Leave Behind.","I just finished watching Deep Space Nine for the first time, and I have to gush!",oh my god

have to give credit to how the handled damar  because wow  i am honestly surprised with how well the handled him  and how much i like him as a character  i honestly thought he would just be some minor grunt who i would like  but not think much of  but his development from a grunt  to a miserable  drunk who reluctantly serves the dominion  to a revolutionary who leads his people to freedom was just perfect  and to have him come to some level of understanding when it comes to how horriblethe bajoran occupation was through the dominion occupation of cardassia was fantastic  and again demonstrates how nuanced star trek  and ds9 especially can be when it comes to writing  it doesn t absolve him of all the horrible things he had done  but it does show that even someone like damar has the capacity to grow  and i truly think that if he had lived  that he would have tried to repent for the bajoran occupation in someway  again  doesn t absolve him  but at least it shows that he had the capacity to be a better man  i seriously just love damar as a character  he s one of my top favorite star trek characters   lt i feel like i said everything i needed to  and i expect that i haven t said anything that hasn t already been discussed many times  but i hope you ve enjoyed my excited rambling  deep space nine was truly something special  and it has become something that i will hold with me forever  now to watch what we left behind  and then onto voyager  i know that from here on out  things get more contentious  but i m going to go into voyager with an open mind and a positive attitude  and hopefully come out the other end satisfied  and as one last note to end on  i thought i d give my  tenative  top 10 episodes  in no specific order  neccessary evil  the visitor  far beyond the stars

0,"Federation starships have awful security.  Here are a few ideas for how to have better security and how to repel boarding parties.  

1. Put a self destruct button on the captain's chair.  That can only be activated by the captain.  The computer can confirm it's the captain by dna scan.  Also label it something different so it's not obvious it's a self destruct button.  Have the self destruct button also lockout the computer and command functions.  The boarders can either leave or be vaporized.
2. Have the computer track crew members so it can identify non crew members.  And increase gravity by five or ten times to pin them to the floor.  And or beam them into the brig or the shuttlebay.  
3. Use transporter scrambers to prevent boarding actions in the first place.  No one is going to want to beam aboard your ship if they think they are going to end in trillions of pieces.
4. Holographic soldiers.  Use holographic soldiers to repel boarding parties.  You could make an army of holograms that activate if the ship is boarded.
5. Interior defenses.  Set up turrets and maybe smoke grenades throughout the ship.  If anyone beams onbard without permission the turrets stun them while the smoke grenades create a distraction.  
6. For the 32nd century you could program the programmable matter consoles to strangle anyone who isn't a member of the crew.  Or have them turn into phasers and stun non crew members.
7. Make it so that the self destruct button also activates all of the ships defenses and does all of the above.  You could arm the self destruct and beam the boarding parties into the brig.  And activate holographic soldiers.  And interior defenses.  And have the programmable matter deal with the boarding parties, etc.  Basically activating all of the ships security systems with one button.  

So the federation really needs to have plans to repel boarding parties.  And have better security on their ships.  These are just a few ways they can do that.",How to repel boarding parties,federation starships have awful security   here are a few ideas for how to have better security and how to repel boarding parties   1  put a self destruct button on the captain s chair   that can only be activated by the captain   the computer can confirm it s the captain by dna scan   also label it something different so it s not obvious it s a self destruct button   have the self destruct button also lockout the computer and command functions   the boarders can either leave or be vaporized 2  have the computer track crew members so it can identify non crew members   and increase gravity by five or ten times to pin them to the floor   and or beam them into the brig or the shuttlebay   3  use transporter scrambers to prevent boarding actions in the first place   no one is going to want to beam aboard your ship if they think they are going to end in trillions of pieces 4  holographic soldiers   use holographic soldiers to repel boarding parties   you could make an army of holograms that activate if the ship is boarded 5  interior defenses   set up turrets and maybe smoke grenades throughout the ship   if anyone beams onbard without permission the turrets stun them while the smoke grenades create a distraction   6  for the 32nd century you could program the programmable matter consoles to strangle anyone who isn t a member of the crew   or have them turn into phasers and stun non crew members 7  make it so that the self destruct button also activates all of the ships defenses and does all of the above   you could arm the self destruct and beam the boarding parties into the brig   and activate holographic soldiers   and interior defenses   and have the programmable matter deal with the boarding parties  etc   basically activating all of the ships security systems with one button   so the federation really needs to have plans to repel boarding parties   and have better security on their ships   these are just a few ways they can do that how to repel boarding parties

0,"A lot of people in star trek don't seem to grasp the basic truth about diplomacy.   Diplomacy only works if you are equal or more powerful then your enemies.  Or on rare occasions when they just happen to be sane and reasonable.  But how often is that the case.  If the federation was more powerful then the borg then they could negotiate a peace treaty with them.  Because the borg would know that if they didn't sign the treaty they would be wiped out.  Or that a war would cost them too much.  So diplomacy only works if you are equal or more powerful then your enemies.  Otherwise diplomacy will fall on deaf ears.  

If the federation really wants peace then they should start arming their ships better and preparing for war.  If their neighbors think that a war will be too e expensive then they will be more inclined to want peace.  This is why the romulans haven't gone to war with the federation in two centuries.  In kirk's era he destroyed a bird of prey that was testing federation defenses.  And in picard's era the alliance between the klingon empire and the federation kept the romulans at bay.  So if the federation really wants peace it should start building more warships.

0,"It wouldn't hurt to see Bashir and a few more Genetically Enhanced Humans in a New Star Trek Series or... Maybe in Picard's Spin-off. Hence, the fact that Bashir — the actor, not the character wants in on an episode of Picard or a future Trek Series due to an article. I want to see Genetically Enhanced Humans or G.E.H. within all the Quadrants and maybe a comic between the Q. Sure... it could be a little dull because they would have some sort 100% Success or lower of Probability depending on the scenario — no such thing as no win scenario unless it wasn't realistic. They would also leave no margin for error. If the writers can do the same thing with Data — which was accepting Androids to an extent, I want to see them do the same thing with G.E.H. Cause they did revive that concept in Archer's time which lead to Dr. Soong's Creation, Data and Lore — possibly Khan, but it was never said, or so I think. 

According to [Moore,](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/47284/why-is-genetic-engineering-illegal-in-the-federation), *'""I kept saying 'What's the secret of Bashir's past? What's the thing that this guy Zimmerman is going to find that's so interesting?' I remember that René and I started talking about genetics, and René pointed out that genetic engineering is one of the things that is oddly missing in the Star Trek universe. It's a concept that's very much out there in science fiction, and even in the real world of science, but in Star Trek, it's virtually never discussed, aside from the fact that there was this thing called the Eugenics Wars at some point, and Khan came out of it."" That conversation ultimately led Moore to come up with the idea that Bashir was genetically enhanced.'

TL;DR: I want to see more Genetically Enhanced Humans in Star Trek. I want to see more than just a glimpse of the Eugenics Wars and if the Genetically Enhanced Humans were ever actually accepted into society proving that they could actually function without causing wars like Bashir, then I guess it could be fine.

I first watched it as a kid with its original airing. I loved the epic space battles and cool aliens and it really cemented my love of the sci fi genre. TNG always felt like it had the ""alien of the week"" whereas DS9 just had the casualness of the background characters walking on the station and the makeup dept could just do anything they wanted. It felt like better world building. My 2nd watch through was about 10 years ago when netflix first started streaming. I was older and could better appreciate the politics and relationships. I'll never understand why the show got flak for switching to season and series spanning arcs for their stories. It leads to amazing character development with great actors really getting to flesh out their roles. On this third watch I really was able to pay attention to the writing and catch all the fun little things they threw into their scripts over the years. Self-sealing stembolts and 2309 bloodwine being just a couple of the little things that I never would have caught as a kid watching 1 episode a week. But now when we can binge and seeing them get carried through all the seasons as little in-jokes and throwaway lines where you can tell the writers we're just having fun is nice. I feel like DS9 was the total package when it came to episodic science fiction. It gave us space battles, cool aliens, romance, politics, religion, espionage and intrigue, science and engineering with the fun treky twist, and through it all just told a good story.

0,"Let’s try this again.

The Borg have a hive mind just like Bees, Ants and Termites, they are social creatures and they act as one as one living organism.

**Facts we know about how Borg work:**
1. They move as one, because they assimilate other species to be ""perfect"".
2. They can communicate to each other and hear other voices all the time.
3. Its a online connection that isn't broken unless they become a individual.
4. Seven of Nine got separated and was very scared and agitated to be apart from the collective.

**Facts we know about how Bees work:**
1. They work as one single organism within the hive, as workers and drones.
2. They can communicate with each other through nothing more then a few “dancing” movements.
3. The connection between the Bees is unbroken unless one gets separated from the hive and becomes an individual.
4. Bees separated from their hive are known to sting people and animals which is a sign of them being scared or agitated.

Hive minds don’t literally have one single mind, they have individual connected minds that act like a single consciousness, each brain acts like the individual cells of a larger brain.

The Borg Queen literally control every drone as if they were puppets, in reality she is just the mouth piece for diplomatic purposes, she is even created by the drones themselves to function as a “mother” figure, we even see her die at least 3 times only to be replaced by a new Queen. Therefore the collective didn’t “explode” on her death as they continued existing without her.

**Some definitions of hive minds:**
1. A notional entity consisting of a large number of people who share their knowledge or opinions with one another, regarded as producing either uncritical conformity or collective intelligence.
2. (in science fiction) A unified consciousness or intelligence formed by a number of alien individuals, the resulting consciousness typically exerting control over its constituent members.
3. The apparent consciousness of colonies of social insects such as ants, bees, and termites.

Hive minds exist in Earth, there’s no reason to assume the Borg hive mind would work differently.

So stop being a Pakled, crying about the Borg having a Queen and being rude to anyone who likes the idea of a Borg Queen just because you misunderstood basic science when the Borg were first introduced.

Who Watches the Watchers was actually the first TNG episode that was pretty good.  But...I had issues.  

Who Watches the Watchers stirred me up.

&gt;TROI: According to Doctor Barron's preliminary reports, the Mintakans are proto-Vulcan humanoids at the Bronze Age level. Quite peaceful and highly rational.  
PICARD: Which is not surprising, considering how closely their evolution parallels Vulcan.

Picard, you’re an idiot. When the Vulcans were in their bronze age they were skewering each other like crazy. They only got peaceful and rational after inventing space travel and nearly annihilating themselves in their own version of World War III.

&gt;CRUSHER: Before you start quoting me the Prime Directive, he'd already seen us. The damage was done. It was either bring him aboard or let him die.  
PICARD: Then why didn't you let him die?

Picard, you’re an asshole. I don’t think I need to explain why.

&gt;TROI: Mintakan emotions are quite interesting. Like the Vulcans, they have highly ordered minds. A very sensible people

Oh thank you Troi. What would we ever do without your insights.

&gt;BARRON: Picard, you must beam Palmer aboard immediately. Without medical attention  
PICARD: It's not as simple as that. He is surrounded by Mintakans. If he dematerialises before their eyes, the impact  
BARRON: It will slightly increase the cultural contamination which already exists. A small price for saving Palmer's life.

Barron is of course right. Just seeing an alien was enough to convince the villagers that something outside their experience is going on and the Picard is real. It makes no difference if they see Palmer vanish mysteriously or he vanishes mysteriously without anyone seeing it. And having an alien dead body or prisoner won’t help either.

&gt;PICARD: Number One?  
PICARD \[OC\]: Is there any chance of your freeing Palmer and transporting up unseen?  
RIKER: We can try.  
PICARD \[OC\]: Try hard.

Picard, you idiot.;

&gt;BARRON: Like it or not, we have rekindled the Mintakans' belief in the Overseer.  
RIKER: And are you saying that this belief will eventually become a religion?  
BARRON: It's inevitable. And without guidance, that religion could degenerate into inquisitions, holy wars, chaos.  
PICARD: Horrifying. Doctor Barron, your report describes how rational these people are. Millennia ago, they abandoned their belief in the supernatural.

Actually if it was that long ago they wouldn’t even remember they ever had it.

&gt;Now you are asking me to sabotage that achievement, to send them back into the Dark Ages of superstition and ignorance and fear? No! We will find some way to undo the damage we've caused.

Here is the fundamental problem with the episode. The Mintakans have seen something they didn’t comprehend and this has revived religion among them.

Except…

**They live in the Bronze Age**

They see things they don’t comprehend every day. Every time they have an outbreak of infectious disease, or a lightning strike, or a meteor, rain, or the flipping sun rising in the morning they’re seeing something they don’t have an explanation for. Humans in the bronze age invented gods for a reason. They didn’t need alien astronauts to do it.

If the Mintakans don’t believe in gods it’s because unlike humans they don’t have a widespread need for gods. Gods answer questions people aren’t content to leave unanswered. Without that need this “religion” certainly isn’t going to spread beyond the actual eyewitnesses to the weirdness and even the eyewitnesses probably wouldn’t conclude anything more than the basically accurate “there’s a strange round-eared tribe with powers we do not comprehend”.

&gt;PICARD: If you believe I am all-powerful, then you cannot hurt me. If, however, I am telling the truth and I am mortal, you will kill me. But if the only proof you will believe is my death, then shoot.  
NURIA: Liko, don't do it!  
OJI: Father, no!  
(Oji jolts Liko's arm enough to deflect the arrow into Picard's shoulder. Nuria holds up her blood-stained hand to Liko and he bursts into tears)

Picard…you idiot. What do Osiris, Baldr, Herakles, Quetzalcoatl, and Jesus all have in common?

They all have stories *where they die* and are worshipped as gods anyway.

Here’s the thing. The episode from start to finish is tainted with subtle contempt for the Mintakans because they aren’t as technologically advanced as the humans for all of Picard’s pretensions to the contrary. Do you know how Kirk would have handled this problem? He would have beamed down, walked up to the village and said “You have a member of my tribe. Could I please have him back?” He would have explained that his people were nomads who would soon be gone.

The problem would have been solved. But Picard and the Federation didn’t have enough respect for the Mintakans to deal with them as beings just as mentally capable as they are even though they don’t have as many toys. So instead they treat the Mintakans as children who need to be sheltered from any hint of reality and fumble around, making things worse at every turn. It’s an insult to the Mintakan intelligence and to that of the audience.",My Rant About Who Watches The Watchers, who watches the watchers was actually the first tng episode that was pretty good   but

That being said, it is of course traumatic and exhausting, both mentally and physically, to care for a dying person.

Science fiction has been my escape since middle school, and Trek specifically since high school. Generally my favorite episodes are the darkest ones (In The Pale Moonlight, Yesterday's Enterprise).

Because I am so physically and mentally drained, it is hard to think straight right now, and in particular my ability to recall is rather impaired. Thankfully I am on FMLA at work right now. But it is also making it more difficult to think of a more *uplifting* Star Trek episode that might help me escape for an hour or two, while not being so dark.

0,"So far we've seen some cool new tech in Discovery that does feel like a big leap from what we've seen in earlier Trek shows (programmable matter, floating nacelles etc.). However, am I the only one who finds it bizarre that weapons don't really seem to have advanced at all, in particular with torpedoes?

We saw Earth use Quantum Torpedoes, however it looks like both Starfleet and the Emerald Chain are still using Photon torpedoes as their standard weaponry. I can just about buy into Quantum Torpedoes being the standard weapon, given it was an advanced new weapon in the late TNG era. You can see how they may have refined that over a few centuries, then engaged in a temporal weapon arms race, before reverting back to conventional weapons (which didn't develop further during the Temporal wars) due to the temporal accords / limited resources.

Photon torpedoes however seemed to have reached their limits in the TNG era, and we know from when Discovery arrived at Starfleet HQ that hull technology has advanced significantly, so its hard to see how these would still be an effective weapon.

As for phasers, at least they've been intentionally more vague, but the effects still look like Star Wars style lasers from the earlier seasons of Discovery, rather than more sophisticated beam style weaponry. It's like they couldn't be bothered to come up with new VFX.

It's rather frustrating, as surely this is a really easy thing for them to get right - just invent some new technobabble weaponry (like they did many times in the TNG era) and don't elaborate on the details, as they have avoided doing consistently so far in Discovery.",31st Century Weapons,so far we ve seen some cool new tech in discovery that does feel like a big leap from what we ve seen in earlier trek shows  programmable matter  floating nacelles etc    however  am i the only one who finds it bizarre that weapons don t really seem to have advanced at all  in particular with torpedoes we saw earth use quantum torpedoes  however it looks like both starfleet and the emerald chain are still using photon torpedoes as their standard weaponry  i can just about buy into quantum torpedoes being the standard weapon  given it was an advanced new weapon in the late tng era  you can see how they may have refined that over a few centuries  then engaged in a temporal weapon arms race  before reverting back to conventional weapons  which didn t develop further during the temporal wars  due to the temporal accords   limited resources photon torpedoes however seemed to have reached their limits in the tng era  and we know from when discovery arrived at starfleet hq that hull technology has advanced significantly  so its hard to see how these would still be an effective weapon as for phasers  at least they ve been intentionally more vague  but the effects still look like star wars style lasers from the earlier seasons of discovery  rather than more sophisticated beam style weaponry  it s like they couldn t be bothered to come up with new vfx it s rather frustrating  as surely this is a really easy thing for them to get right   just invent some new technobabble weaponry  like they did many times in the tng era  and don t elaborate on the details  as they have avoided doing consistently so far in discovery 31st century weapons

The psychedelic references and visuals troughout the show.

The fact they even named Paul stamets after one of my psychedelic heroes, namely the real Paul Stamets.

In the approximate month the admiral has known of the discovery its had 3 or 4 incidents of insubordination or refusal of orders, and had already given Saru a warning about his command that led to him making a green ensign 1st officer. From the outside Discovery must seem chaotic and at risk of mutiny. Now we have a situation where the captain backed Tilly to his face and she failed at the first hurdle, which is not just bad for her reputation, its hugely damaging to how competent Saru looks to a 32nd century observer, on top of what looks like pretty sketchy ability to follow basic chain of command stuff.

0,"So I was going to comment this on another post, but ultimately decided to make my own post instead. Also, disclaimer, I have seen TOS and most of TNG as well as most of the movies. Otherwise, I haven't seen much else and so these arguments mainly apply to TOS and TNG, but can also refer to others. That also means that understandings of ethics from the writers are likely outdated and thus these missteps from my perspective may not be entirely their fault. (Oh and this is all on mobile, so many apologies)

As we know, the use of the Prime Directive (PD) has been pretty inconsistently applied throughout the franchise, but from what I recall, they are nearly always false dilemmas rather than a true moral one. An episode centering around the PD usually centers around the following question: 

Do we interfere with a people's natural progression if it means helping them? 

When we talked about ethics in my classes (I went to grad school for anthropology so it was kinda important), this becomes an issue with two main dimensions: knowledge vs ignorance and life vs cultural purity. 

An episode focusing on PD usually starts the plot where Starfleet notices a problem that the native people have no way of noticing. Let's say, a natural disaster. A ton of the episode is spent with the cast debating 1. Whether to help at all and 2. If the people can be helped... secretly. But the actual people who would be affected almost never get input. It is as if because these people fail to meet arbitrary advancement requirements (space travel), they are treated as if they are incapable of making decisions on their own behalf. 

This is the failing in how PD is treated in such episodes. The various cultures aren't any less intelligent just because they can't go to space. They simply lack access to the same information as Starfleet does. If we applied that to current comparisons, that is like saying that a modern hunter-gatherer is dumber because they can't drive a car (also assuming that if they had access to a car that they would even want to). Flipping that, it would be saying that anyone reading this post is dumb if they don't know how to identify safe and edible plants in the wild. The Inca, a very complex civilization, never developed the concept of the wheel. Did that make them any less intelligent? 

No it doesn't. So why does Starfleet refuse to include them in discussions about their future? 

I'll get back to this, but first let me shift to the second part of the issue: life vs cultural purity. 

Yes, the act of contacting them in order to ask for their input would introduce concepts and technology that they may not be ready for, but this is like the Trolley Experiment. Refusing to take action, resulting in larger loss of life than whatever sacrifices taking direct action would take is not a passive thing. The moment Starfleet notices something will happen, anything they do at that point, even if it is to do nothing, is still a specific choice on their part. If Starfleet truly wishes not to interfere, then they must also completely avoid those people. By observing, they are just setting themselves up to make these choices. If Starfleet truly wanting nature to take its course, they will truly let these people be. But they don't. By observing them, they must accept that sometimes there are negative affects to doing such research. Can't have your cake and eat it too. 

Literally the only reason not to help is because it will mess with the ""natural progession"" of the people in question. But that's... that makes a ton of assumptions. 

If a cultural has any contact with Starfleet, they will just... what? Abandon their own culture and copy Starfleet? That's an incredibly laughable concept, honestly. Not only do people interact with those of other cultures all the time and not just 100% assimilate, but if they find ideas they do genuinely like, what's the harm in holding it back? It isn't like Starfleet is colonizing the planet by saving them from a volcano. They aren't forcing these people to abandon everything they know and love. The native people will adopt what they want and keep what they want. This is the very common phenomenon called transculturation. Ideas are shared between cultures all the time and all cultures involved change in some way because of it. 

Change isn't necessarily a bad thing. So why is it such a big deal in PD episodes? Because looking at it from this perspective makes the whole argument shaky at best. ""If we save them, they will want to copy us. But we want them to be themselves so we won't even give them the choice of letting us help them."" 

Pretty absurd to me. 

So why does this come up a lot in Trek? Honestly, it is an easy way to give a moral dilemma on television. Writers want these characters to be able to have ethical debates, but also want them to be universally loved. So the solution is to paint the issue as more grey than it truly is so that when the characters do make the ""right"" decision, it is hard fought. If they make the ""wrong"" one, then it is more excusable. Win-win for the writers. 

Personally, I think the true ethical debate would be, if after such a culture is contacted, they refuse the help for whatever reason. Now that would be very difficult since the Starfleet characters in question know they can help, but are required to respect the decision of the planet's inhabitants. What the characters do would be good insights into them as individuals, honestly. And if such an episode exists, please point me to it so I can see it play out.",The Prime Directive: A False Dilemma,so i was going to comment this on another post  but ultimately decided to make my own post instead  also  disclaimer  i have seen tos and most of tng as well as most of the movies  otherwise  i haven t seen much else and so these arguments mainly apply to tos and tng  but can also refer to others  that also means that understandings of ethics from the writers are likely outdated and thus these missteps from my perspective may not be entirely their fault   oh and this is all on mobile  so many apologies as we know  the use of the prime directive  pd  has been pretty inconsistently applied throughout the franchise  but from what i recall  they are nearly always false dilemmas rather than a true moral one  an episode centering around the pd usually centers around the following question  do we interfere with a people s natural progression if it means helping them  when we talked about ethics in my classes  i went to grad school for anthropology so it was kinda important   this becomes an issue with two main dimensions  knowledge vs ignorance and life vs cultural purity  an episode focusing on pd usually starts the plot where starfleet notices a problem that the native people have no way of noticing  let s say  a natural disaster  a ton of the episode is spent with the cast debating 1  whether to help at all and 2  if the people can be helped    secretly  but the actual people who would be affected almost never get input  it is as if because these people fail to meet arbitrary advancement requirements  space travel   they are treated as if they are incapable of making decisions on their own behalf  this is the failing in how pd is treated in such episodes  the various cultures aren t any less intelligent just because they can t go to space  they simply lack access to the same information as starfleet does  if we applied that to current comparisons  that is like saying that a modern hunter gatherer is dumber because they can t drive a car  also assuming that if they had access to a car that they would even want to   flipping that  it would be saying that anyone reading this post is dumb if they don t know how to identify safe and edible plants in the wild  the inca  a very complex civilization  never developed the concept of the wheel  did that make them any less intelligent  no it doesn t  so why does starfleet refuse to include them in discussions about their future  i ll get back to this  but first let me shift to the second part of the issue  life vs cultural purity  yes  the act of contacting them in order to ask for their input would introduce concepts and technology that they may not be ready for  but this is like the trolley experiment  refusing to take action  resulting in larger loss of life than whatever sacrifices taking direct action would take is not a passive thing  the moment starfleet notices something will happen  anything they do at that point  even if it is to do nothing  is still a specific choice on their part  if starfleet truly wishes not to interfere  then they must also completely avoid those people  by observing  they are just setting themselves up to make these choices  if starfleet truly wanting nature to take its course  they will truly let these people be  but they don t  by observing

0,"FAN THEORY: 

Gagh is alien in origin, it did not evolve on Q'onos, but was instead an invasive species of ""blight"" from the Hur'q Homeworld. It is revered in Klingon society because Kahless was the first Klingon to use his weapons as farm tools to grow food from the land instead of relying on a hunter-gatherer way of life to survive. This basically kicked off a ""neolithic revolution"" that was instrumental to the Klingons resisting and eventually ""overthrowing"" the Hur'q.

This theory is a combination of multiple theories:

Assumption 1: The Klingons are a race of Obligate carnivores. They need relatively fresh meat to sustain themselves.

Assumption 2: The Klingons were a slave/game race created by the Hur'q

Conclusion: Gagh is the only real Klingon food that can be mass produced as a staple ""crop"". Prior to its domestication, Klingons were pack hunters with total/local populations too small to effect any real resistance to the Hur'q Invasion due to the basic limits of how needing prey animals to eat the available plant-life before you can eat the animals looses %90 of the total food energy a given area can produce.","Gagh is so revered in Klingon culture because worms are the only thing a species of Obligate carnivores can effectively ""farm""",fan theory  gagh is alien in origin  it did not evolve on q onos  but was instead an invasive species of  blight  from the hur q homeworld  it is revered in klingon society because kahless was the first klingon to use his weapons as farm tools to grow food from the land instead of relying on a hunter gatherer way of life to survive  this basically kicked off a  neolithic revolution  that was instrumental to the klingons resisting and eventually  overthrowing  the hur q this theory is a combination of multiple theories assumption 1  the klingons are a race of obligate carnivores  they need relatively fresh meat to sustain themselves assumption 2  the klingons were a slave game race created by the hur qconclusion  gagh is the only real klingon food that can be mass produced as a staple  crop   prior to its domestication  klingons were pack hunters with total local populations too small to effect any real resistance to the hur q invasion due to the basic limits of how needing prey animals to eat the available plant life before you can eat the animals looses  90 of the total food energy a given area can produce gagh is so revered in klingon culture because worms are the only thing a species of obligate carnivores can effectively  farm 
0,"I'm finding it incredibly dull and childish. I originally was skeptical but then I turned around in season 1 and really started enjoying it. It wasn't as good in season 2 but I got through it and though there could be good potential in season 3. This season seems to be even worse than early Voyager and that's saying a lot.

Here are some of my beefs:

* They can't just bring back daddy Lorca even though he was my favorite character, they had the perfect opportunity

* I hate that annoying low voice they use to talk to each other. Nobody else is around, why are you whispering?

* The seasons had Burnham having the most focus but now the focus on Burnham has far exceeded previous seasons. Why? She's not the captain. Since when has a Star Trek series focused more on someone that's not the Captain? She's not even the first officer.

* Idiot childish stories, go to a planet to solve a physiological/time travel issue and you just happen to encounter the guardian of forever and it's 1000x more campy than the original TOS episode.

* ""That's rude of you to refer to me as 'She/Her'. You should be able to read minds and tell that I go by 'They/Them'

* Tilly got fat, that is inexcusable.

0,"When you’ve been watching the show for years and you know the plot - and their mission - by heart it can be easy to forget how cleverly this episode is written. 

In almost every episode the audience knows exactly what’s going on from beginning to end. And it’s because we’re seeing the whole episode through the eyes of the senior command. We start with Picard’s log entry telling us what their mission is. We get to see all the staff meetings, the mission briefings, etc. 

But in this episode - and this is the part you can easily forget if you’ve been watching this for 25 years like I have - the audience knows almost nothing about what’s going on for almost the entire episode. The ship is near the Cardassian border...there’s some escape pod they need to get and there’s a lot of secrecy about who’s in it...Picard needs a certified pilot...LaForge is doing some kind of strange “tests” involving phaser fire on a shuttlecraft and he doesn’t appreciate observations that it looks like they’re faking damage to a fleeing vessel...there’s an injured Cardassian...that’s about it. It’s really a mystery to the audience what’s going on and that’s because we’re seeing the mission through the eyes of the junior officers, all of whom are only told whatever they need to know to carry out their assigned tasks. 

It’s only at Ensign Sito’s mission briefing that we really find out what’s going on. That’s more than halfway through the episode.

0,"So I just decided to start watching the franchise considering Netflix has a seemingly large portion of it, and I just finished the OG series. I have to say it leaves a lot to be desired despite planting the seeds of a good franchise and I felt like doing a write up of what I liked and disliked. It's enjoyable enough, but it's certainly a product of its times.

I'll start off with some things I really like:

* Spock is a great character. When odd stuff happens to make him laugh or show other emotions you actually have a sense that this is unnatural. Probably the best character in the series
* Bones is also pretty great. He's kind of the heart of the Enterprise and even though you don't always agree with his ideas you understand where his opinions come from. I really liked the episode where he got the terminal disease and married the alien woman. I was kinda hoping the two did just go off and have him retire. (What happened to that disease anyway? Dangling plot thread unless I missed something)
* The episode where they test the computer as the new ship controller was actually really funny because it called Kirk out how he always sends himself, Spock, and Bones instead of crewmen like a normal military mission would be. Obviously this is what happens cuz it's TV, but it would make it a bit more realistic if he wasn't the vanguard 24/7.
* Uhura is by far the best female as she actually does important stuff. I recently rewatched an episode of Comicbook Men where her actress visited and it was interesting hearing that she almost quit but was asked to stay by Martin Luther King Jr.
* Young George Takei. That is all
* I also enjoy the general premise of the series, even if it's just to allow for an indefinite episodic storyline

Now let's get into some issues I have with it:

* First, a small complaint I have is the general lack of military-esque things. This is supposed to be a military ship and Checkov has a Beatles bowl cut. I don't know why but that small detail bothers me so much. At least his Russia obsession is amusing. There's also a large lack of competency when people fight on the show, so that's not so fun to watch
* Just about every Kirk/random woman dynamic is annoying and repetitive. The only one I found endearing was his Native American wife/baby momma, and the first few love interests weren't that bad. But most of the latter ones are just intolerable. Most of those episodes can be summarized by ""Kirk and co. find bad people. Kirk seduces alien woman. Betraying the woman saves the day, and they must abandon their spark despite their feelings"". It's so boring and I hate it. Remember that time an alien sabotaged the ship just to makeout with Kirk? Haha.... yeah.......
* American/Earthly parallels. This would have been interesting if it was once or twice. But it's happened like five times and it's so horribly contrived. Also, the intimate detail Kirk had about the cowboy time period was so stupid. Spock I could believe, but that was a pretty ridiculous episode. While we're on the topic, the one with Abraham Lincoln was also not too great. That entire storyline would have been amazing if Lincoln was replaced with a made up galactic or interplanetary war hero/general. But it being an American president is just so so so lazy and frustrating.
* Unsatisfying endings. Some of these episodes just leave you thinking ""So that was it? WTF"". To name a few: the one where Kirk's wife just dies, pretty much anytime they encounter Romulans, when they just let the alien who stole a shuttle go cuz his people were dead, and the episode where Klingons arm some primitive people. That last one in particular was super upsetting, because everything was absolutely unresolved. Did they really just say ""oh well, guess the Prime Directive was right haha"" and leave the planet? That doesn't even make any sense
* The women's outfits. This just bothers me. They're not practical at all, and in the first few episodes it's like some of the women's only job is to attend to the Captain. I don't get this one at all. Also the episode where they're eating dinner and keep telling the ambassador she's beautiful is very.... awkward and plain uncomfortable to be honest.
* Technology like Bones' little scanner is just ridiculous. This is another of those ""product of its time"" things, but I just roll my eyes when he waves it over someone for 2 seconds and makes a thorough medical analysis. The phrase ""He's dead Jim"" will haunt me forever

All in all, I think the series sets up a good universe for the future series and introduces some good characters. I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the franchise after I power through the animated episodes next. What is the general consensus on the best series?

0,"A while back I made a post asking why Chakotay episodes are so boring. A few people told me that season 7’s Shattered was the exception, and I’m happy to say they were right. Shattered is a fantastic episode. 

I think the reason it works so well is because it’s not JUST a Chakotay episode- it’s a Chakotay and Janeway episode. Chakotay’s character works best when he’s interacting with others, and his bond with Janeway is my favorite because they have such a great relationship. Even when separated by 7 years they still are able to bond and trust each other, and that love is shown here so well. 

Shattered also works because it’s an episode that relies on series continuity, which VOY typically lacks. This is the one episode that really rewards you for watching everything and sticking by the series for 7 seasons. 

Side note I’m still bitter they didn’t become a couple- it was already written all you had to do was make it canon writers! This isn’t even a case of the time period because it was a m/f relationship- there was no reason they couldn’t become a thing. Seven and Chakotay is BS (I’m a multishipper so I like most ships but that one and Spock/Uhura I just cannot enjoy. Respect to those that do though).",Why VOY’s ‘Shattered’ Works as a Chakotay Episode,a while back i made a post asking why chakotay episodes are so boring  a few people told me that season 7 s shattered was the exception  and i m happy to say they were right  shattered is a fantastic episode  i think the reason it works so well is because it s not just a chakotay episode  it s a chakotay and janeway episode  chakotay s character works best when he s interacting with others  and his bond with janeway is my favorite because they have such a great relationship  even when separated by 7 years they still are able to bond and trust each other  and that love is shown here so well  shattered also works because it s an episode that relies on series continuity  which voy typically lacks  this is the one episode that really rewards you for watching everything and sticking by the series for 7 seasons  side note i m still bitter they didn t become a couple  it was already written all you had to do was make it canon writers  this isn t even a case of the time period because it was a m f relationship  there was no reason they couldn t become a thing  seven and chakotay is bs  i m a multishipper so i like most ships but that one and spock uhura i just cannot enjoy  respect to those that do though  why voy s  shattered  works as a chakotay episode

0,"I understand how dangerous time travel is.  And why the federation would want to ban it.  But what right do they have to impose that ban on the whole galaxy.  And having one law or treaty that says you can't do something no matter the situation is too rigid.  The use of time travel should be judged like prime direction violations.  On a case by case basis.  If the temporal accord had been around in the 23rd century do you think kirk would have sat on his hands and said oh I want to stop earth from being annihilated by an alien probe.  But I can't because of the temporal accord.  Of course not he would have gone back in time anyway.   Why because it is the right thing to do.

But according to the temporal accord kirk should have been immediately thrown in jail.  Even though he didn't alter the timeline.  Then there was that one guy who traveled from the kelvin timeline and into the future.  Who the federation let die painfully instead of sending him back to his universe.  Because of the temporal accord.  When rules and laws becomes so rigid that they are willing to sacrifice people like that then they have become too rigid.  There should be reasonable exceptions for the use of time travel.  

Also does the federation plan on forcing this accord on everyone in the galaxy.  Who gave them the right to do that.  What about aliens who use time travel but with the consent of their people and they don't effect the history of the federation or anyone else.  Are starfleet ships going to show up over their planet and force them to sign the temporal accord.  That would be tyrannical.  That said those who do use time travel as a weapon against others should be dealt with.  And should not be tolerated.  The temporal accord does that by prohibiting time travel regardless of the situation.  Which is way to rigid.  

If the federation can't be reasonable with it's laws and treaties then it should expect members to just outright ignore them and non members to refuse to sign them.  That being said their should time travel watchdogs who track malicious use of time travel while almost ignoring non malicious use of time travel.  And each incident should be judged on a case by case basis.  If they can't do this then they become a tyrannical organization and something that should be opposed. 

Also notice how the federation ignores the temporal accord when it's inconvenient.  If they were to follow it to the letter then discovery's crew would be in the brig.  But they want their spore drive so they let a group of time travlers roam free.  Risking a temporal war if the other factions find out about it.  So they don't even follow the temporal accord when it benefits them to not do so.  But letting a man die painfully instead of sending him back to his universe that didn't benefit them to break the temporal accord so they didn't.  But discovery's spore drive does so they will break the temporal accord to use it.  So they are hypocrites.

So the bottom line is if they can't be sane and judge time travel use like prime directive violations on a case by case basis then they are the bad guys.

0,"So this recent episode of Discovery has given us who and what caused the burn and a lot of people are not amazed by it. But what I think is that the burn isn't the big reveal as we are thought to believe but in fact the federation has been infiltrated by The Chain. The burn happened the same time in another alternate universe where the federation has crumbled but being how admiral Archer has help win the temporal cold war the federation has bought some time to exist. I think in the temporal war the federation has lost badly and as a result this was their ultimate fate to be no more. Some how in this future dilithum would be its down fall, because if they could not destroy earth in the temporal cold war they could destroy what is the federation as a whole. None of its key planets are in it and even so the klingons aren't even mentioned as to which gives hint they too have suffered from a loss of that war being how the Orions are causing havoc. I think someone has helped altered events to make sure the federation would be obsolete but the error they made was dilithum.

Now I Think admiral Vance and Book are working with The Chain and that is why Discovery has been compromised because they have planted devices to help track the ship and its capabilities to Osyraa. How come she knows Discovery has a spore drive? How come she knew where discovery was? Also why has Book been so keen on joining Starfleet? I think Book and Vance was feeding information to her behind their backs. The admiral also has been very hesitant on finding out the cause of their burn.  This also begs the question or even a trip down memory lane as to when Micheal found discovery, Gergiou knew something was up with her and when she beamed back to Discovery she was giving her the cold shoulder. Lets add on to the fact that  Saru and Tilly suspected something off with her when she got back. A year can be a long time, but when you're an adult a year isn't very long to let go on something or someone. I suspect Micheal isn't who she is and she's something else, maybe the Grudge?  

I would also like to add on about what happened to Georgiou, she needed to go back in time because of her time traveling dilemma. She started having her issues as soon as Kovich interrogated her but she also knew something was up with the federation because how could they let something like the burn happen or even figure it out in 125 years? 

Also time travel is banned but who or what is keeping tabs on who or what time travels?  Lets also add who can detect who or what time travel? 

My theory is this, the federation is and was compromised by the chain but they were only able to do to altered events which made the federation lose the Temporal War. Kovich is actually starfleet/section 31 who knew Georgiou needed to be sent back to make sure she can give info on what was the fate of the federation 1000 years from where ever she was sent back to. Also Micheal, Book, and Vance are not who they say they are.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday we learned that at the center of The Burn is a planet made of dilithium. When the crew sees this somebody (I can't remember who) says something to the effect of ""this would solve the scarcity problem"" and everyone seems to think this solves the dilithium problem. Book even says ""the galaxy just got a whole lot smaller.""

Now obviously this is true... for awhile. But reliance on any non-renewable recourse is inherently a temporary solution. Assuming the entire planet is made of dilithium it should be easy to calculate how long this one planet will last. But consider that The Federation had many dilithium mining planets. And those only lasted about 1,000 years. When you consider that for the early part of that time there were much fewer ships, and the majority of the dilithium was coming from Earth's moon alone for the first 100 years this doesn't seem like a lot. By the time of The Burn the Federation also included Klingon space, and likely Cardassian and Romulan space too. That's a lot of dilithium. And all 350 member wolds spend what, 100 years trying to find an alternative. And only one almost-solution was found that was deemed to dangerous?

And now it's not just the Federation's supply of dilithium, but the entire galaxy's. The Federation is setting itself up to fail. The entire galaxy knows that in X years there will be no more dilithium and everything will go back to the way it was. Even the Spore Drive needs dilithium crystals to carry power.

Now you may say ""but isn't that how our world works right now?"" To which I say yes, it is. And look at where that's been taking us for the past century. How hopeful is the average person about the state of the world in 100 years time? Plus the people of Star Trek have been shown to clearly understand the problems with this kind of dependence. Even in the days of Enterprise.

So my question is, is this planet a solution at all or is it just a 1-200 year temporary fix? Remember I'm assuming 100% of the planet is pure dilithium, but that planet didn't look purple and crystal-y to me.",How Much Dilithium would it take to fix the scarcity issue?,major spoilers for the latest episode of discovery  amp  x200b yesterday we learned that at the center of the burn is a planet made of dilithium  when the crew sees this somebody  i can t remember who  says something to the effect of  this would solve the scarcity problem  and everyone seems to think this solves the dilithium problem  book even says  the galaxy just got a whole lot smaller  now obviously this is true    for awhile  but reliance on any non renewable recourse is inherently a temporary solution  assuming the entire planet is made of dilithium it should be easy to calculate how long this one planet will last  but consider that the federation had many dilithium mining planets  and those only lasted about 1 000 years  when you consider that for the early part of that time there were much fewer ships  and the majority of the dilithium was coming from earth s moon alone for the first 100 years this doesn t seem like a lot  by the time of the burn the federation also included klingon space  and likely cardassian and romulan space too  that s a lot of dilithium  and all 350 member wolds spend what  100 years trying to find an alternative  and only one almost solution was found that was deemed to dangerous and now it s not just the federation s supply of dilithium  but the entire galaxy s  the federation is setting itself up to fail  the entire galaxy knows that in x years there will be no more dilithium and everything will go back to the way it was  even the spore drive needs dilithium crystals to carry power now you may say  but isn t that how our world works right now   to which i say yes  it is  and look at where that s been taking us for the past century  how hopeful is the average person about the state of the world in 100 years time  plus the people of star trek have been shown to clearly understand the problems with this kind of dependence  even in the days of enterprise so my question is  is this planet a solution at all or is it just a 1 200 year temporary fix  remember i m assuming 100  of the planet is pure dilithium  but that planet didn t look purple and crystal y to me how much dilithium would it take to fix the scarcity issue

I'm not bitter, I'm just saying the ending of this episode reminded me of TNG's Rascals; except this ep was not as plausible.

Seriously, though.

I wonder if maybe Discovery shouldn't have found Starfleet HQ, and had been forced to tackle a hostile galaxy with only the Sphere AI and Spore drive as their main advantage. Then it would make slightly more sense for them to constantly get *effortlessly* owned by scavengers and travelling salesmen with future tech and tactics.",Discovery in Season 3 (Spoilers for S03E11 - Sukal), i m not bitter  i m just saying the ending of this episode reminded me of tng s rascals  except this ep was not as plausible seriously  though i wonder if maybe discovery shouldn t have found starfleet hq  and had been forced to tackle a hostile galaxy with only the sphere ai and spore drive as their main advantage  then it would make slightly more sense for them to constantly get  effortlessly  owned by scavengers and travelling salesmen with future tech and tactics discovery in season 3  spoilers for s03e11   sukal

0,"So in the episode Shore Leave they encounter a planet that literally makes their dreams come to life.  They later decide to make it into a resort.  By TNG era however people regularly have holodecks so is it still worth it?  

I think it maybe because in some ways is much better.  For one you don't have to program it, the planet just scans your mind for you to create what you want. Also a holodeck program is only as good as the programmer can make it. There maybe flaws that the user sees that the programmer didn't.  You get everything you want on the Fantasy Planet.

However holodecks only act when you program to.  The downside to the fantasy planet is it makes any you think come to life.  Try to clear your mind and you may run into the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man.  Not only that but it isn't just you who generates fantasies.  Anyone you are with or who is already there are doing it as well.  So if someone dreams of a dinosaur watch out.   

In the episode we meet  Yeoman Tonia Barrows who is kinkest person ever to join Starfleet!  Her fantasy is for some medieval knight to show up, fight to win her, kidnap her, and rip her dress off.  She was the only one of this crew to have an abduction fetish, but you get a whole ship load down and I think some really crazy stuff might start happening because it only takes one person to think of it.

___

**Episode 40 - ""Su'Kal""**

* This is the first episode since ""Raijin"", and fifteenth overall, to have a title consisting only of a character's name. Partial matches since then include ""The Trouble with Edward,"" ""Ephraim and Dot,"" and ""Much Ado About Boimler.""
* A portrait of the *USS Clarke* is displayed on the mess room wall; the *Clarke* was destroyed at the Battle of the Binary Stars.
* Nebulae are commonly used by ships to hide from other ships. It's less common that a nebula or nebula-like region is actively harmful or dangerous to vessels, but examples include the McAllister Nebula in ""Chain of Command,"" the nebula in ""One,"" the Briar Patch from *Insurrection,* the Necro Cloud in *Beyond* (the latter two of which also contained planets inside), and the Expanse from ENT's third season. Occasionally a nebula is found to be a living creature, as was the case in ""Bliss.""
* Dr. NotCulber appears to double as a veterinarian to care for Grudge. Dr. Crusher and Dr. Phlox were conscripted into the same role when tending to Spot and Porthos, respectively.
* An inordinate amount of time is spent on the crew worrying about the safety of the away team, as though it weren't a routine part of the job. Picard had to weigh his feelings for Commander Daren against sending her on a dangerous mission in ""Lessons.""
* Tilly cites her ""Granny Adele."" Captain Picard had an Aunt Adele who gained fame for her homeopathic sleep remedies.
* Occasionally away teams are cosmetically altered to resemble native species (""First Contact"" et al.) or to spy on enemies (""The Enterprise Incident"" et al.); Doug Jones' appearance without his heavy makeup evokes ""Far Beyond the Stars"" in which the usually-alien crew appear as humans.
* Holodecks in the 24th century were also capable of projecting custom skins on their users. Later we see the radiation affecting the away team, which is curious since the program would presumably hide all of that; Saru also complains about a human fear of heights, suggesting he is ""actually"" human, but this could just be psychosomatic.
* The holodeck appears to be malfunctioning. This only happened once before, in ""Elaan of Troyius.""
* The recreation of the Kaminar admission ceremony includes two aliens, one who looks like a Saurian with smaller eyes and another with six tentacles protruding from its head and a double Fu Manchu. I would not be surprised if these were more examples of ""use aliens seen in the background of a deleted scene of one movie and see if the nerds notice"" but I am unable to identify them. The Starfleet uniforms and badges are unfamiliar and are likely meant to evoke a random period in Federation history between the PIC era and the Burn.
* Book hypothesizes that Osyraa used a transwarp conduit to find them. Transwarp conduits are hyperspatial corridors used by the Borg to fast-travel across the galaxy.
* It is revealed that *Discovery* now has a cloaking device. In the crew's home century, cloaking technology had not been achieved by the Federation, and in the 24th century the Federation was barred by the Treaty of Algeron from using it except under certain circumstances. With the Romulans now reunified with the Vulcans, it makes sense that the treaty is no longer in effect. It is remarked that the ship cannot spore-jump while cloaked, adding to a list of things cloaked ships can't do for plot convenience.
* Issa created a holoprogram to take care of Su'Kal. This is very similar to the situation in ""Future Imperfect.""
* The theme and motif of the holoprogram felt to me not so much a holodeck episode but more of an ""enter a character's mind"" episode like ""Extreme Measures"" or ""Dark Page."" Out of canon, it also reminded me of 80s fantasy films like *The Dark Crystal,* *Mio in the Land of Faraway* and *Labyrinth* (or, more relevantly, its similarly-named 2006 spiritual successor, which also featured monsters, Doug Jones, and a haunting lullaby).
* Tilly hides behind Sigmund Freud as a defense mechanism. Freud previously appeared in ""Phantasms.""
* Osyraa grabs the *Discovery* with tentacles, as the Pakleds did in ""No Small Parts."" That episode was produced after this one so technically the callback is reversed.
* Starships are hijacked by outside forces in ""Basics,"" ""One Little Ship,"" ""Rascals,"" and others.","Canon References - ""Su'Kal"" [Spoilers]",previous episodes

Also being able to quickly activate the self destruct or at the very least lock out control of the ship would be a good idea.  Also being able to quickly lock on to anyone who isn't part of the crew and beam them into space wold be another good option.  They could also modify the artificial gravity so that it increases five or ten times for anyone who isn't part of the crew.  That would neutralize a boarding party pretty easily.

I know that their replicators have been deactivated by that time, but if the chain reaction happens that quickly and affects the whole minefield, how should the whole thing have been able to work at all?

0,"So I finally got around to watching all of Discovery over the past couple of weeks. That was the last Trek show I hadn’t seen yet! Ok I haven’t seen any cartoons either but - 

Anyway I was frankly not into the first season at all. It was depressing, did not feel like Trek one bit, was overly futuristic for a time period that was supposed to be before TOS, and I didn’t like any of the characters. Plus it was just too complicated, and frankly not a fan of the plot. And don’t get me started on those weird Klingons lol like what was that? Anyway. 

Second season, with the arrival of Pike, and slight change of tone and resolutions of certain discrepancies between the Trek we know and that (Klingons back to normal, tech explanations like holograms etc.) a slightly more positive vibe - I started to get into it. In fact I’m really looking forward to Strange New Worlds!! 

I do miss Lorca though - he was one thing I loved about season 1. I wish they brought back his prime universe version or something. 

Then season 3 arrived and wow... just wow!! The future is incredible and I love that there is just nothing we can say about how it doesn’t fit with the rest of Trek technology wise now because it’s just so far ahead. I love that we’re seeing completely new territory, in a way that makes sense. The tone has gotten SO much more positive and I’m really feeling the true Trek vibes now. So much emotion! So much hope!

Is it ever explained why warp 10 turned Janeway and  Tom into amphibians, but does not occur in any other episode of any series? I mention the TNG episode above where they exceed warp 10 due to an engine malfunction. There have also been a couple of times in TOS where they exceed warp 10, but I chalk it up to them not knowing what they were doing at that point in the shows production, and Scotty claimed it to be impossible.

I never really watched voyager that much since it's my least favourite, but maybe I'm missing something and being dumb since I remember something about wacky dilithium being used; but the way the episode portrayed it was that warp 10 was near impossible, dangerous, and sped up your biology for some weird reason.

0,"Why do so few planets in star trek have planetary defenses.  We've seen a few planets that had decent planetary defenses.  The planetary shield and defense grid over earth in discovery was impressive.  But for the most part few planets have planetary defenses.  Why is that?  Considering the federation's history of war and conflict (for an organization devoted to peace they do get into a lot of wars) you would think their member worlds would have planetary defenses.

A planetary defense grid is much cheaper then building a fleet of starships.  Because they don't need warp drive, just a few thrusters to keep them from falling out of orbit, their much smaller then most ships, and they aren't used often so the energy cost is low.  A planetary shield is an even better option if you have the power and technology.  But even without a shield a planetary defense grid can take out a fleet of ships.  

Another option is mines.  Self replicating mines if you have the technology.  You could build the mines in space and when your expecting unwanted guests you could have them maneuver into position or beam them into position.  That way you have several layers of defenses between a fleet of enemy ships and the planet.  Ground to space cannons are also a good option.  So that even if ships get past the orbital defenses they still get blown out of the sky from the cannons on the ground.

Most of these planetary defenses are cheap.  Mines and orbital weapon platforms are easy to build.  A planetary shield would be more difficult but possible.  With the proper planetary defenses you could hold off the entire klingon or romulan fleet.  Maybe even both.  So considering the federation's history of war they should start equipping their member worlds with effective planetary defense systems.  The dominion war would have turned out differently if most federation worlds had effective planetary defenses . The dominon fleet would have been wiped out over batazed instead of conquering the planet.  So the federation really help their member worlds defend themselves better.  That they are prepared for future wars.",Planetary defenses,why do so few planets in star trek have planetary defenses   we ve seen a few planets that had decent planetary defenses   the planetary shield and defense grid over earth in discovery was impressive   but for the most part few planets have planetary defenses   why is that   considering the federation s history of war and conflict  for an organization devoted to peace they do get into a lot of wars  you would think their member worlds would have planetary defenses a planetary defense grid is much cheaper then building a fleet of starships   because they don t need warp drive  just a few thrusters to keep them from falling out of orbit  their much smaller then most ships  and they aren t used often so the energy cost is low   a planetary shield is an even better option if you have the power and technology   but even without a shield a planetary defense grid can take out a fleet of ships   another option is mines   self replicating mines if you have the technology   you could build the mines in space and when your expecting unwanted guests you could have them maneuver into position or beam them into position   that way you have several layers of defenses between a fleet of enemy ships and the planet   ground to space cannons are also a good option   so that even if ships get past the orbital defenses they still get blown out of the sky from the cannons on the ground most of these planetary defenses are cheap   mines and orbital weapon platforms are easy to build   a planetary shield would be more difficult but possible   with the proper planetary defenses you could hold off the entire klingon or romulan fleet   maybe even both   so considering the federation s history of war they should start equipping their member worlds with effective planetary defense systems   the dominion war would have turned out differently if most federation worlds had effective planetary defenses   the dominon fleet would have been wiped out over batazed instead of conquering the planet   so the federation really help their member worlds defend themselves better   that they are prepared for future wars planetary defenses

Therefore, it could be understandable that mutated Klingons, seen as misfits, would be sent altogether to the same part of the galaxy. They would still be part of the empire, working to continue its expansion, but far from the ""normal"" Klingons as if they were sent into exile. That would explain why the enterprise ran into the same ""faces"" and also it would explain why we don't get to see any mutated Klingon in Discovery.

That said, it's my personal hypothesis. It would be great to see those old school Klingons at least once in Strange New Worlds.

0,"... is the fact that, until ""Balance of Terror"", nobody in the Federation knew that the Romulans were related to the Vulcans.  No human had ever seen a Romulan before so they didn't know they had the same appearance.  The Romulan commander's appearance was even a surprise to Spock.  It was a major part of the backstory that during the Federation-Romulan war from a century before, there were no visual communications, and they only talked by radio.

What gets me, is that back during ""Enterprise"", Archer's crew had even heard Romulans speak, untranslated.  In the reboot movies, alternate-Uhura could even speak Romulan -- all three dialects of it -- and stated she was about the only human who could distinguish spoken Romulan from spoken Vulcan.

Considering that T'Pol was a native Vulcan, and Sato could also speak Vulcan without the assistance of the UT (which she herself could program, anyway) -- nobody thought to mention that these sight-unseen hostile aliens were speaking a nearly indistinguishable version of a language that was spoken by Earth's only alien allies of the moment?  And the fact of that significant similarity did not get passed down through the war, which was a major inciting incident for the founding of the Federation?

0,I know dilithium is scarce because of the burn.  But they still have really advanced technology.  And apparently their ships have cloaking devices.  So I say find a small ship and go hide out on an asteroid or in deep space.  If it's cloaked the chances of someone finding you is really low.  And if your ship isn't moving it's not using much power.  And there are other power sources then antimatter which requires dilithium.  And with replicators you won't run out of food or water.  You could also grow your own food and conserve replicator energy.  So with technology that advanced it shouldn't be mad max in space even if the federation were to fall.

The Terran Empire is strong, but is clearly destined to fall. It is evident that with the new and improved Georgiou at the helm, they may have a chance. She proves to be even MORE badass than the Terrans, who simply rely on cruelty as a cop out.

One issue that I never understood, even as a kid, was in Chain Of Command part 1. Its like, you have a heavy-duty hazardous mission. The stakes are huge. What do we do? Send an aging ship captain, a CMO, and a security officer.

But where were the special forces? Does Starfleet not have an equivalent to the SEALs? Okay, so it was some highly classified material. But spec-ops guys have high clearance for exactly that reason.

So what's up with that? Because I saw no valid in-universe explanation as to why they sent Picard, Crusher, and Worf.

0,"Asking for both in-universe and show watching reasons. I'm watching DS9 for the first time, having caught sporadic episodes of next generation on tv and seen a number of the movies. In DS9 they rarely announce set phasers to stun, or to kill, so in action scenes it's hard to tell are they killing, stunning, tickling or what?

Specifically in one episode (I just started season 3, so first two seasons spoilers- fairly mild) Kira and Obrien raid a cardassian prison camp and shoot multiple guards. Being in open combat, I assumed these guards were killed. Later in the episode tribunal, O Brien stated he has not killed any Cardassians since the war. Is he lying, or had he genuinely stunned the guards? How long does a stun last? I understand the diplomatic reasons to stun rather than kill, but isn't it tactically risky?

My other reason for asking is if you're being shot at, do you have any ability to determine the level of firepower you're being hit with? short of checking vitals on someone who has been hit, do you have any indication whether their weapons are set to lethal mode?","Is There Any Way To Tell a Phasers Setting?

0,"I'm not sure how gender identity was understood when this episode came out, but since gender identity is becoming a less taboo thing the talk about and its importance to society is better understood, it surprised me how respectfully this idea is treated in the show.

If you haven't watched it lately (It was my first time today), the basic premise is that there is an androgenous race that has no genders since in the past the have ""evolved"" to be a single gender. However, some people are still born with gender tendencies such as male/female feelings and identities. These people are hunted down, socially punished, and ostracized until they publicly admit that they are non-gendered like everyone else. One such person self identifies as female, and she is put on trial for it. Some very interesting quotes arising from that scene:

Sorin: ""I am tired of lies. I am female. I was born that way. I have had those feelings, those longings all of my life. It is not unnatural. I am no sick because I feel this way. I do not need to be helped. I do not need to be cured. What I need, and what all of those who are like me need, is your understanding and your compassion. We have not injured you in any way, and yet we are scorned and attacked, all because we are different. What we do is no different from what you do. We talk. And laugh. We complain about work, and we wonder about growing old. We talk about our families and we worry about the future. and we cry with each other when things seem hopeless. All of the loving things that you do with each other, that is what WE do. And for that, we are called misfits and deviants, and criminals. What right do you have to punish us? What right do you have to change us? What makes you think you can dictate how people love each other?""

The response?
""I congratulate you Sorin. Your decision to admit you perversion makes it much more likely that we can help you.""

I could go on about this, but I'll stop there so I don't write out the whole script of the episode.","Just watching TNG 5x17 - The Outcast, and it seems to me that Star Trek was ahead of its time with respect to gender identities",i m not sure how gender identity was understood when this episode came out  but since gender identity is becoming a less taboo thing the talk about and its importance to society is better understood  it surprised me how respectfully this idea is treated in the show if you haven t watched it lately  it was my first time today   the basic premise is that there is an androgenous race that has no genders since in the past the have  evolved  to be a single gender  however  some people are still born with gender tendencies such as male female feelings and identities  these people are hunted down  socially punished  and ostracized until they publicly admit that they are non gendered like everyone else  one such person self identifies as female  and she is put on trial for it  some very interesting quotes arising from that scene sorin   i am tired of lies  i am female  i was born that way  i have had those feelings  those longings all of my life  it is not unnatural  i am no sick because i feel this way  i do not need to be helped  i do not need to be cured  what i need  and what all of those who are like me need  is your understanding and your compassion  we have not injured you in any way  and yet we are scorned and attacked  all because we are different  what we do is no different from what you do  we talk  and laugh  we complain about work  and we wonder about growing old  we talk about our families and we worry about the future  and we cry with each other when things seem hopeless  all of the loving things that you do with each other  that is what we do  and for that  we are called misfits and deviants  and criminals  what right do you have to punish us  what right do you have to change us  what makes you think you can dictate how people love each other  the response  i congratulate you sorin  your decision to admit you perversion makes it much more likely that we can help you  i could go on about this  but i ll stop there so i don t write out the whole script of the episode just watching tng 5x17   the outcast  and it seems to me that star trek was ahead of its time with respect to gender identities
0,I've been rewatching discovery.  Just for the hell of it.  And I think that starfleet's tactics at the battle of the binary stars was inept.  They should have fallen back and regrouped with the federation fleet.  Engaging a superior enemy with one ship when you know they have backup on the way is foolish.  I know they were trying to protect federation planets.  But the best way they could defend the federation is to fall back and regroup.  Even if civilians get massacred in the long run they would be in a better position to win the war.  Leaving a few colonies undefended is better then losing the entire federation.  The best approach is to fall back to the federation core worlds and defend them with most of their ships.    Let the klingons come to them.  There are advantages to adopting a siege mentality when faced with a superior force.  With less territory to defend they would have a much stronger perimeter.  They would be leaving many federation worlds out to be massacred but in the long run it's the best strategy to win the war.,Starfleet's tactics at the battle of the binary stars was inept.,i ve been rewatching discovery   just for the hell of it   and i think that starfleet s tactics at the battle of the binary stars was inept   they should have fallen back and regrouped with the federation fleet   engaging a superior enemy with one ship when you know they have backup on the way is foolish   i know they were trying to protect federation planets   but the best way they could defend the federation is to fall back and regroup   even if civilians get massacred in the long run they would be in a better position to win the war   leaving a few colonies undefended is better then losing the entire federation   the best approach is to fall back to the federation core worlds and defend them with most of their ships     let the klingons come to them   there are advantages to adopting a siege mentality when faced with a superior force   with less territory to defend they would have a much stronger perimeter   they would be leaving many federation worlds out to be massacred but in the long run it s the best strategy to win the war starfleet s tactics at the battle of the binary stars was inept

So how the hell is she to blame for the war.  Also a life sentence seems like a really harsh sentence for mutiny.  Especially considering she didn't actually accomplish anything.  Also considering the klingons history any sane person should have realized the likely outcome of a confrontation would be war no matter who fired first.  

Also I have to wonder if she would have been punished if she had fired and the klingons backed off.  If someone were to mutiny and stop a war would they still be thrown in the brig.  Regardless you have to give burnham credit.  She mutinied knowing it would ruin her career.  Because she beloved it was the right thing to do.  She didn't mutiny for selfish reasons.  And that should have been considered before she was handed a life sentence.  They make her out to be a monster when she was just trying to stop a war.

The Doctor as the Emergency Command Hologram is Bad Ass! It is really smart to have that programed for him and only the commanding officers can activate it. As much as Tuvok and Seven of Nine are superior assets to the crew, the Alpha Omega Super Saiyan of the crew is the doctor. Like when the whole crew had to be in statis pods for like 2 months and only Seven and the doctor had to get them through. I feel he is the equivalent of Data is for Enterprise. 

When Voyager gets back, the Federation needs to research how effective Holograms are and what they can do for not just Sick Bay, but the whole ship. They could get small research vessels with only Holograms and go into Nebulas or other harmful to humans parts of space and scan to find new information. I forsee the ability of having a skeleton crew of human and the rest Holograms, at least on my ship. Plus, if they get boarded, just make 100 Klingons or Borg or Hirogen Holograms to fight the intruders. It's not like they can be shot or hurt. 

Thoughts? I am aware that there is that beam that gets rid of Holograms, but you could modulate the shields ahead of time to stop that, knowing that would erase your crew. Also, I am aware of the glitches, but the Doctor is a model 1 Holograms, not intended for all he does. He is beyond his programming and I would thank model 4 or 5 would be more robust and have backup programming, if the primary fails. You also would surely have to have a Programmer or Engineer or two to manage all of them. Plus, no food or atmosphere needed.

0,"One of the questions that ive often wondered, is, after First Contact and the arrival of the Vulcans, what do people think happened immediately thereafter. 

Canon details of the century between First Contact and the start of *Enterprise* are relatively sparse-we know that there was something called the Post Atomic Horror (somewhat unclear what actually happened), and a few prominent figures such as someone called Colonel Green did some less than ideal stuff, and at some point, United Earth emerged, but its never really specified how quickly knowledge of the Vulcans spread worldwide and how this happened. 

After all, its not even clear what governments still existed in the 2060s post WW3 and to what extent their writ ran and communications were possible. For example, did the Vulcans have to effectively reconnect the chaotic remnants of the world themselves-did they have to do multiple first contacts with multiple governments (and if so did they all go peacefully or did Vulcan have to disarm some human militaries?) and where they didnt exist, assist in reconstituting some governments on a provisional basis-effectively rebuilding and uniting an entire world from scratch, is something of a tall order even for an advanced society like Vulcan.

0,"I feel that our literature, TV and cinema have always served as a reflection of our culture and I sincerely believe that over the life of the franchise, Star Trek is simply a better reflection. Let me start by acknowledging the controversial nature of this view within the hardcore geek community, but I encourage a spirited debate. Although I’ll concede that Star Trek and The Next Generation (TNG) adhere to the same general naval exploration theme with predictable plots and outcomes (both series were written and directed by Gene Roddenberry), I find that the rest of the franchise does much to break this mold. **Disclaimer - There are naturally several ""spoilers"" in the article to follow.**

Starting with Deep Space Nine (the first series after Roddenberry’s death) we see a significant departure from the previous Star Trek model. DS9 largely abandons the naval theme of the previous series and explores the concept of the Castle Doctrine (the military principle of projecting strength from a central base or port). At the time of DS9's release, most American military experience and doctrine was focused on strength through maneuver rather than castle doctrine. It wasn’t until the Global War on Terror (GWOT) that most Americans intuitively understood the principles of fighting from centralized bases. The series also dedicates much of the story line to exploring the ideas of asymmetric warfare and insurgency. In the years before GWOT, these concepts were generally unexplored within US media making the show almost prophetic. Lastly, DS9 was also the first Star Trek series with any meaningful exploration of the subject of religion (Roddenberry was an avowed atheist and considered religion to be largely superstition). I found Captain Sisko's journey from disbelief in his own role in the Bajoran religion to his eventual acceptance of the 'Prophets' to be extraordinarily insightful.

The next series in the franchise was Voyager and it largely expands on the moral dilemmas introduced in DS9. We see that the Prime Directive is no longer sufficient to provide guidance in a gritty and honest plot line. We find the crew of Voyager struggling with the morality of doing the wrong thing for the right reason and sacrificing the good of others for the sake of self-preservation. I found the early theme of cultural interference to be fascinating. The crew of Voyager are faced with the eternal decision of helping a developing society or allowing them to suffer through the natural evolution of their circumstances. This can be seen in parallel to several modern geo-political situations that we find ourselves in today. Very insightful and thought provoking situations resulting in no right decision, but many wrong ones. I found the alliance with the Borg late in the series to be a believable and interesting take on ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" situation and reminiscent of the forced alliance between the American and Soviet militaries in WWII. I also find Captain Janeway's character to be the most fully articulated Star Fleet captain of the franchise to date.

Next came Star Trek Enterprise; easily my favorite series in the Star Trek Universe. For the first time, we see a meaningful exploration into the limitations that logistics impose into military maneuver and operations. Most military leaders acknowledge that logistics is often the difference between success and failure on the battlefield, but up until this point, the writers of Star Trek had largely ignored the subject (I recognize that Voyager did explore this subject to a limited extent, but Enterprise made it a more regular theme). We also see an interesting take on anti-imperialism in the human resentment of the Vulcans for “holding them back.” This can be paralleled to US efforts to influence/shape other nations yet keep them reliant on American support. Lastly we see Captain Archer spend his entire life trying to escape his father’s legacy only to discover in the end that he himself is the pivotal historical figure that all humans (and the Federation in general) will later immortalize.

Please feel free to add to the discussion.

People don't seem to have this issue as much with Star Trek, so I'll give it an honest go, as this is also part of an endeavor to rebuild my attention span and step away from my smartphone (picking up novels again in addition to paying full attention to TOS episodes).

They could have jumped to earth to warn starfleet about contrrol and then jumped to the delta quadrant.  If they had jumped to where voyager was thrown by the caretaker it would take a federation starship of that era almost two hundred years to reach them.  Their ships were pretty slow back then.  They made a lot of progress with warp drive between then and the mid 24th century.  So they could have jumped to the delta quadrant and waited for starfleet to wipe out control.  This is a way better plan then the insane plan they came up with.

0,"Hi folks!  


I'm totally new to Trek and really want to dive in and watch it all. I also thought it would be fun to run a podcast, so I'm discussing hosting one with a friend and chatting about each episode as I go.  


As someone who knows next to nothing about Trek (and is trying to avoid spoiling anything) I'm just wondering if anyone has a suggestion for a show logo. My idea was to call it Cadets, referencing Starfleet Cadets, and to have the logo/banners visually reference Trek cadets in some way. From a quick Google image search though, I couldn't find anything that specifically identifies cadets; in TNG it seems as though they share the same red colour as the command folks.  


So my question is, can anyone point me to a colour scheme/insignia from any Trek generation (although earlier is preferable) where someone familiar with Trek would see it and say ""oh that's the cadet colours/symbol from the \_\_\_\_ series"". Does something like this exist? It wouldn't even need to be a Starfleet cadet, that's just my initial idea. If there is an example of another race or organization with a recognisable symbol for students, that's cool too.  


It's 4am here so I'll be sleeping as soon as I post this; if there are any questions I'll get to them when I wake up.

As far as I remember, it was a shareware game included in the usual 1990s CD-ROM of ""50+"" or ""256!"" shareware/freeware games one could find. 

It was, IIRC, an unofficial Star Trek DOS adventure game that was in first person, reminiscent of TOS or TAS in graphics. However, the first puzzle of the game was simply to find a way to leave the room and I never did, so I would just look around the room and get foiled by the single door and then quit the game.

I figured at the time my computer was incompatible for some reason so I could not find ordinary controls, or my intuition was terrible or it was an ""escape room"" involving a Scotty-like cutting of the wall to hack the door mechanism.

So I’ve been obsessed with TNG my whole adult life and, like most of you, I admire Captain Picard. Patrick Stewart is magnificent in this role and I’ve always looked at Picard as the father I always wanted instead of my back woods, gun loving father. 

That being said, I finally took the plunge and tried another Star Trek series, namely Voyager, and holy shit, Janeway is all over every mission. She’s on away missions, she’s working with the engineer to find a solution to the problem at hand, she comes up with ideas during their group sessions she’s all over the fucking place. And I gotta say, I’m here for it. 

When going back to watch an episode of TNG, Picard comes off as lazy by comparisons. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not throwing any shade because Picard will always be an iconic figure in my life, it’s just amazing to me that I never realized how little he actually did when the time came.

0,"Mandalorian is a huge success, and fans love it. it has revived the love of StarWars for many and rescued the franchise after the disaster that was the Sequel Trilogy.

Does that sound familiar? The new Trek movies in JJ era aren't as bad as ST but they leave a lot to be desired. And the new shows are worse.

What Mandalorian did was show that 'old school' storytelling, characters, heart, vision and passion, can still work. 

Most importantly, it was done by people who know SW and care about it.  Its not a show created by hacks like Kurtzman, and written by a room of writers whose goal is to stuff it full of every modern cliche and tick every PC box. Again, \*exactly\* like how the new ST movies were done.

JJ movies/DSC/PIC are the equivalent of what JJ/Kennedy/Riann did to StarWars - best forgotten.

Mandalorian IS StarWars, it evokes the same feelings. We need a Trek show with the values of Trek - hope, exploration, optimism.

(here come the usual complaints about 'it must be new !!', 'you must adapt to modern times and appeal to current agendas !!', 'it can't be more of the same !!')

In Sarek’s first scene with Kirk, Sarek really pushes Kirk to take Spock’s body to Vulcan. He says things like “you denied his future” “all Vulcans do this” etc. He culminates this speech by rallying Kirk to Genesis, imploring him to find any way to do it.  

This is not how I remember the scene at all. In my memory, Kirk was desperate for anything that could bring back Spock. Sarek was much more incredulous about Kirk’s chances to save Spock, even commenting on the antiquity and rarity of the whole Katra thing. The scene I recall was Kirk pulling information from Sarek and denying all logic to save Spock.

The whole series so far has felt like a children's show. Even during the more boring parts of the other series, I still enjoyed the characters enough to stick with them. I don't find any of the characters in DS9 to be interesting in the least.

I feel like DS9 has also almost ruined the Bajoran-Cardassian conflict, which I actually found interesting in TNG.

0,"Spoilers for Discovery

In the latest episode, Georgiou is sent to an unspecified time when the Mirror and Prime Universes were not that far apart. Given narrative in the rest of Discovery indicates there hasnt been a crossing in over 500 years (speaking from the 31st century), and given that the majority of documented crossings span the 22nd century (Enterprise) the 23rd century (TOS and DIS) and the 24th century (TNG, DS9), then it seems plausible that this 200 year period is the target setting for the new Section 31 show starring Georgiou.

What is your preferred time and event?

Personally, i think the new show should effectively act as the sadly never made season 5 of Enterprise, which as the build up set in season 4 makes clear, was supposed to chart the opening of the Earth-Romulan war. Afterall, war settings are generally the best use of a spy agency in a dramatic setting, 

It also gives the show the chance to go into detail about the politics and machinations behind the founding of the Federation which happened as a direct result of the war.",Preferred setting for the new Section 31 show?,spoilers for discoveryin the latest episode  georgiou is sent to an unspecified time when the mirror and prime universes were not that far apart  given narrative in the rest of discovery indicates there hasnt been a crossing in over 500 years  speaking from the 31st century   and given that the majority of documented crossings span the 22nd century  enterprise  the 23rd century  tos and dis  and the 24th century  tng  ds9   then it seems plausible that this 200 year period is the target setting for the new section 31 show starring georgiou what is your preferred time and event personally  i think the new show should effectively act as the sadly never made season 5 of enterprise  which as the build up set in season 4 makes clear  was supposed to chart the opening of the earth romulan war  afterall  war settings are generally the best use of a spy agency in a dramatic setting  it also gives the show the chance to go into detail about the politics and machinations behind the founding of the federation which happened as a direct result of the war preferred setting for the new section 31 show

0,"I've been rewatching discovery.  Just for the hell of it.  And I watched an episode in season two where they find a planet fifty thousand light years away with humans who were brought there hundreds of years ago by what they called the red angel.  Which just turned out to be a time traveler.  And I noticed how easily primitive people are fooled by advanced technology.  They saw them beam up and thought they were gods.  It just shows how easy it is to fool primitive people who haven't seen technology.  We don't have transporter tech but a lot of people if they saw someone disappear into thin air they wouldn't just assume they were a god.  If we saw a hundred foot jesus in the sky we wouldn't just assume that it's really a deity.  Holograms have been in science fiction for decades and the government has secretly been developing that tech.  

But primitive people can't conceive of technology that can make someone disappear or project a hundred foot jesus into the sky.  So they are really easy to fool.  It makes me wonder how many aliens with advanced tech were involved in creating the major religions.  Because that is what happened in that episode.  They saw a time traveler with advanced tech and thought it was an angel.  You can fool primitive people with parlor tricks like that.  But you can't fool a technological civilization.  Even a primitive one.  So how many aliens with advanced tech were involved in creating religion.  Just something to think about.  Honestly I'm surprised that in star trek the federation doesn't deal with more prime directive violations like that.  Someone could land on a primitive planet and pose as a god.  I'm surprised it's not a common occurrence.

0,"With this Post I just want to ask how other fans react to my Unpopular Opinions. 

I'll try to keep it as Spoilerfree as I can. Except for Lower Decks, Picard Episode 3 onwards, Short Treks Episode 6 onwards and Voyager Episode 26 onwards, Because I haven't seen them yet and I can't spoil anything what I haven't seen, right? 😂

Also, it could be that I've more, I just don't know if my Opinion is Controversal. And don't name every trek-specific controversal opinion, because I have too much. (I'm easy to Impress)

Anyway let's Start:

**The Original Series**

I think it's Definetly Controversal to Say, that I really like the Alternative Factor. In my Opinion it's a Great Story. implementing an Entire Universe, Called the Anti-Matter Universe and we see some interesting dynamics between the trekverse (?) and this universe, What I really Like.

Also, Most People think Turnabout Intruder is the Worst TOS Episode. Why? In my Opinion it's the Best of Season 3 and also one of the Best TOS Episodes. It has a great and Unique Idea, that the Captain is no longer the Captain, because he was... Possessed (?) Ok I don't know the word in English, because I'm not english, but hopefully you Understand What I mean. And this allows also for a Interesting Dynamic between Kirk (the ""Ghost"" of him) and Kirk (the woman in the body of kirk).

And lastly City on the Edge of Forever is the worst Episode Ever (Joke)

**The Animated Series**

Idk if it's that controversal, but when I go by the IMDB Score there's definetly a Difference. So I name the 2 Episodes, but I wouldn't call them Something Special. I kinda Enjoy Bem and The Magicks of Megas-Tu. But I can't tell why. Except for Yesteryear, More Tribbles More Troubles, The Series Finale and the named Episodes is this Series Awful, so I have nothing more to Say.

**Movies 1-6**

The Only Realy Controversal Opinion is that I think Wrath of Khan is just Alright, because Khan is annoying and feels like no threat at all. I think it's annoying that Kirk being an Admiral, and Kirks son is also annoying, like Project Genesis.","Unpopular Opinions - How would other fans React to mine?

0,"Aside from a couple of comments, first post in r/startrek! 

Just sharing something here because it's wholesome. Me and my sister grew up together watching the very occasional episode (I was 8 and she was 6 when TNG first aired in our country) aided by our mum, who was secretly a big ol' nerd and would insist that we kept Trek on if we ran across it while channel hopping. I think my first memory of the show is the bit in The Naked Now when Data is putting the chips back in the board super fast.

I started really paying attention in high school around DS9's later seasons, and for some reason my sis ended up watching a lot more TNG than I did. As we grew into adults I mainly stuck to many of my nerdy pursuits, going on a more tech-fuelled life trajectory and she broadened her horizons with travel, languages and teaching. But it always stayed as a running joke that any time she was stuck, she'd think ""What would Captain Picard do?"" (or ""what would Snoop Dogg do"" , but that's another story).

We're super tight - best friends, and in lockdown, FINALLY, I got her to give DS9 a try. This is after years of me going ""seriously, it's serialised, it's complex, nobody's purely good or evil, you'll love it. Worf is in it!"" and her going ""I believe you, I'm sure it's great, but I love TNG so much, it's what I grew up with, I'd feel like I was cheating on TNG if I got into DS9""

Well, one of the stations she watches started airing the whole run, and she's tried it. And she LOVES it. In her words ""I think I might be able to be... er... polytrekerous"". She's already latched onto Father Of The Year Benjamin Sisko, and spotted how if something bad's gonna happen to someone, it's gonna happen to Miles Edward O'Brien. Her favourite characters are Odo and Quark (no change from the few episodes she saw as a little kid, then), and as of the writing of this post she's up to the Past Tense two parter.

Probably to show off the pointy teeth prosthetics (and to make them look a bit dim), Ferengi almost always have their mouths open. The few times his mouth is closed it's usually in consternation. 

The wide open but pointy smile fits so well with Ferengi attitude, happy to please--but they're always ready to bite, at least your wallet. And try talking with your lips pressed over your gums like that--it's weird, I'm sure they must have practiced it a lot.  

It gives them a genuinely alien demeanor in a way that's not over the top, I really like it a lot. Also shoutouts to Saru's ""supermodel walk"" which is great too.

0,"I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/jjbels/rewatching_tos_for_the_first_time_as_an_adult_its/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) in October about how I was beginning TOS again after a decade since I first watched 2/3rds of it. Last night I completed the series and I am really stunned by the experience. Having never finished the series as a kid, there was so much I hadn't seen before, and so much I hadn't remembered. There's a lot the criticize, but the show is easily one of the best I've ever seen--there's a magic to it that gives it so much staying power. 

Here's some quick and largely unoriginal thoughts:

* I watched it in production order and I feel it was definitely the right decision. It created a sense of continuity in watching the show develop in a linear way. There's a degree of character development that comes from the actors growing into their characters

* Expanding on that,  I swapped the order of the last 2 episodes so that it ended with All Our Yesterdays. Another good decision imo--it's a stunning episode and as Kirk-Spock-McCoy story it makes for a fitting ending

* Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are the heart of the show and their relationship is of its consistent strengths. It's less of an ensemble show than I remember. I've seen it mentioned before, but it wasn't something I noticed when I was younger

* Spock is the best character. Kirk is a great captain and isn't the womanizing swashbuckler he's portrayed as in pop culture and in the Kelvin films

* Season 3 isn't that bad. The budget cuts are obvious and you can tell that they ran out of money at the end there, but overall I loved most of it. When it's at its best, it has some of the series' highest moments. It's uneven and suffers more from being underdeveloped and underfunded than being outright bad. Not to say it doesn't suck donkey balls sometimes. I was genuinely surprised overall

* Favorite episode: The Enterprise Incident
 * Other favorites (in no order): Mirror, Mirror, A Piece of the Action, The Menagerie, All Our Yesterdays, Journey to Babel, Metamorphasis, Arena, Where No Man Has Gone Before, Dagger of the Mind, I, Mudd, A Private Little War, The Savage Curtain, The Tholian Web, 

* Least favorites (again, no order): The Alternative Factor, Catspaw, The Apple, The Gamesters of Triskellion, Miri, Tomorrow is Yesterday, The Paradise Syndrome, Let That Be Your Last Battlefield, Whom Gods Destroy, The Mark of Gideon, Turnabout Intruder, The Way to Eden, That Which Survives, The Omega Glory

Overall this was a truly amazing experience and I'm so excited to inevitably rewatch it a thousand more times. I'm beginning TAS now, which I also saw about half of about a decade ago, so it'll be like watching it for the first time.

I'd say this has been a great decision",Finished my first full watch of TOS,i made a  post   in october about how i was beginning tos again after a decade since i first watched 2 3rds of it  last night i completed the series and i am really stunned by the experience  having never finished the series as a kid  there was so much i hadn t seen before  and so much i hadn t remembered  there s a lot the criticize  but the show is easily one of the best i ve ever seen  there s a magic to it that gives it so much staying power  here s some quick and largely unoriginal thoughts   i watched it in production order and i feel it was definitely the right decision  it created a sense of continuity in watching the show develop in a linear way  there s a degree of character development that comes from the actors growing into their characters  expanding on that   i swapped the order of the last 2 episodes so that it ended with all our yesterdays  another good decision imo  it s a stunning episode and as kirk spock mccoy story it makes for a fitting ending  kirk  spock  and mccoy are the heart of the show and their relationship is of its consistent strengths  it s less of an ensemble show than i remember  i ve seen it mentioned before  but it wasn t something i noticed when i was younger  spock is the best character  kirk is a great captain and isn t the womanizing swashbuckler he s portrayed as in pop culture and in the kelvin films  season 3 isn t that bad  the budget cuts are obvious and you can tell that they ran out of money at the end there  but overall i loved most of it  when it s at its best  it has some of the series  highest moments  it s uneven and suffers more from being underdeveloped and underfunded than being outright bad  not to say it doesn t suck donkey balls sometimes  i was genuinely surprised overall  favorite episode  the enterprise incident   other favorites  in no order   mirror  mirror  a piece of the action  the menagerie  all our yesterdays  journey to babel  metamorphasis  arena  where no man has gone before  dagger of the mind  i  mudd  a private little war  the savage curtain  the tholian web    least favorites  again  no order   the alternative factor  catspaw  the apple  the gamesters of triskellion  miri  tomorrow is yesterday  the paradise syndrome  let that be your last battlefield  whom gods destroy  the mark of gideon  turnabout intruder  the way to eden  that which survives  the omega gloryoverall this was a truly amazing experience and i m so excited to inevitably rewatch it a thousand more times  i m beginning tas now  which i also saw about half of about a decade ago  so it ll be like watching it for the first time  i ve heard good things about star trek continues so i might have to give it a watch too  as well as throw in some new voyages phase ii because it was really important to me as a kid   then i ll be onto the movies which i ve seen countless times and then onto tng  which i ve seen maybe 25 episodes of  and then the other 6     shows  so i ve got a lot ahead of me lmao  i d say this has been a great decisionfinished my first full watch of tos

Watching this episode for the first time just made me question how dumb Worf and Jadzia really are. Worf has always been kind of the punching bag in TNG as the dumb brute who always had his ideas shot down, but in DS9 he was suppose to be taken more seriously. But in Change of Heart, there was nothing more stupid than what had happened.

They're on their way to rendezvous with a Cardassian spy. Walking 20KMs through dense jungle behind enemy lines.

Jadzia gets shot about 7KMs into the journey by some Jem'hadar, and is steadily bleeding from her wound. Instead of telling her to turn around and go back to the Runabout to get rest and/or treat herself, with Worf venturing out to the rendezvous point on his own, he drags her with him for the next 13KM trip. What was his plan here? Have her go with him to get the spy, and then walk another 20KMs back to the Runabout? If the first 13KM didn't kill her, the second 20KMs definitely will. This is on top of both of them constantly having to delay and rest to tend to her wound. Just the worst strategy ever.

I know this episode is suppose to demonstrate how deep their love is but all it demonstrated to me is how bad Worf is at tactics and strategy.  
At the end of the episode Sisko tells Worf he will probably never get his own command (even though he does command the Defiant multiple times after this event) I completely agree that he should never be in charge of people.",What was Worf's plan in S6E16 Change of Heart?, watching this episode for the first time just made me question how dumb worf and jadzia really are  worf has always been kind of the punching bag in tng as the dumb brute who always had his ideas shot down  but in ds9 he was suppose to be taken more seriously  but in change of heart  there was nothing more stupid than what had happened they re on their way to rendezvous with a cardassian spy  walking 20kms through dense jungle behind enemy lines jadzia gets shot about 7kms into the journey by some jem hadar  and is steadily bleeding from her wound  instead of telling her to turn around and go back to the runabout to get rest and or treat herself  with worf venturing out to the rendezvous point on his own  he drags her with him for the next 13km trip  what was his plan here  have her go with him to get the spy  and then walk another 20kms back to the runabout  if the first 13km didn t kill her  the second 20kms definitely will  this is on top of both of them constantly having to delay and rest to tend to her wound  just the worst strategy ever i know this episode is suppose to demonstrate how deep their love is but all it demonstrated to me is how bad worf is at tactics and strategy   at the end of the episode sisko tells worf he will probably never get his own command  even though he does command the defiant multiple times after this event  i completely agree that he should never be in charge of people what was worf s plan in s6e16 change of heart

0,"I have an Idea, in how to connect the Space Station of Episode 03 with the Mobile Federation HQ

- the Ni'Var trust now Starfleet or at last Discovery to give them one of their SB-19 Gate's

- Let the Discovery jump back to this Station with her Spore Drive and Deliver this Gate

- The other Side is at the Mobile HQ so they also Receive one SB-19 Gate 

- Et Voila! Of course they first send only Robot Ships to starting fixing the Station and do Space Wreaks cleanup to make it save for Ships

- SB-19 Travel-route done

or other solution

- Let Discovery repair the needed Subspace Relays to get in contact with the Station

- If they succeed in making contact they are not Home yet.

- If Communications and Data link is established, they could Try something out

- Someone invent some sort of 3D Printer with an Data link trough this communication Line

- Yes, some sort of remote controlled 3D Printer. 

- Discovery could deliver this Platform as well and all they need to run it up

- They ""teleport"" the Robot Drones trough this solution. For Humans this is still to risky

- They Fix the Station and do the Cleanup until the Mobile HQ can visit it in real

Sure, if they could right away teleport Humans trough this, then they also could directly get the Trans warp Device out of the Bin or even build an Bigger one to Teleport entire Ships, no Spore Drive is needed. So since it is to early for this invention we need this ""ancient"" Prototype here",Idea for an Discovery Scene possible in Season 4,i have an idea  in how to connect the space station of episode 03 with the mobile federation hq  the ni var trust now starfleet or at last discovery to give them one of their sb 19 gate s  let the discovery jump back to this station with her spore drive and deliver this gate  the other side is at the mobile hq so they also receive one sb 19 gate   et voila  of course they first send only robot ships to starting fixing the station and do space wreaks cleanup to make it save for ships  sb 19 travel route doneor other solution  let discovery repair the needed subspace relays to get in contact with the station  if they succeed in making contact they are not home yet   if communications and data link is established  they could try something out  someone invent some sort of 3d printer with an data link trough this communication line  yes  some sort of remote controlled 3d printer    discovery could deliver this platform as well and all they need to run it up  they  teleport  the robot drones trough this solution  for humans this is still to risky  they fix the station and do the cleanup until the mobile hq can visit it in realsure  if they could right away teleport humans trough this  then they also could directly get the trans warp device out of the bin or even build an bigger one to teleport entire ships  no spore drive is needed  so since it is to early for this invention we need this  ancient  prototype hereidea for an discovery scene possible in season 4

Hubs and I are on our way back from vacation about 2+ hours from our house, stopped to get gas (gas station is also part Arby's? 🤔), stopped in for a potato cake and as I'm ordering from the manager, his ringtone goes off- it's phaser fire. I was pulling out my card to pay when I asked if it was phaser fire and he immediately lit up. I could tell he was having a rough day before this, but we had a little 5+ minute discussion about Picard and Discovery before I left! I just love how I could have meaningful discourse with a total stranger in the middle of no where. When I left, he wished me well and was grinning under his mask! Star Trek did that!

**Episode 39 - ""Terra Firma, Part 2""**

* Mirror Burnham admits there is a coalition forming to destroy the Terran Empire. This coup was explored during DIS' first season. A rebellion was attempted a century earlier during the events of ""In a Mirror Darkly,"" and after Georgiou's time the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance would finally succeed in bringing the Empire down.
* Among the races Mirror Burnham tattles on is the Denobulans. This is the first direct reference to Dr. Phlox's race outside ENT (there was a mention of Denobulan bacteria in LD), although this is the Mirror Universe and they may be classified as a distinct species. The Mirror Denobulans were established in ""In a Mirror Darkly"" as a subservient race within the Empire.
* The opening credits are vertically flipped and chromatically inverted, representing the episode's setting in the Mirror Universe. This is a nod to the ""Mirror Darkly"" arc in ENT, whose Mirror episodes featured a darker opening sequence.
* Among the *ISS Discovery's* crew is Mirror Airiam (who was also seen last week but missed by me), as a full Terran and not a cyborg. Other than Georgiou herself, the only other notable Mirror character seen to be alive after her Prime counterpart was killed is Jennifer Sisko (noting of course that this episode still takes place before Prime Airiam dies).
* Georgiou watches Mirror Burnham's agony session through a monitor enclosed in her wall. This is likely a Tantalus field, a weapon that can remotely disappear anyone from a distance. Mirror Kirk possessed a Tantalus field and ""Mirror Mirror"" implied that it was not a common tool within the Empire.
* Georgiou plants seeds of ""another way of doing things"" in Mirror Saru's ear; the same tactic was used by Kirk to convince Mirror Spock to make a change in ""Mirror, Mirror."" That change, of course, eventually led to the Empire's collapse.
* This is the first on-screen appearance of the vacation hotspot Risa in the NuTrek era. Unlike any of its other appearances, it is here depicted with rings.
* This episode carries on a Mirror Universe tradition of indiscriminately killing off alternate versions of major characters.
* Other than the main headline, the rest of the content of Carl's newspaper is the same as last week. Items not previously logged by me include ""Andorian Famine Contained"" (not a known reference) and the edition of the paper as ""Vol. MMMCLXXXVIII,"" or 3188. Notably the correct present-day date should be 3189, as it took Burnham a year to find *Discovery.*
* We learn that Georgiou experienced three months within the span of a minute. A number of characters have done speedruns of dreams or hallucinations, perhaps the most famous being Jean-Luc Picard instantly serving a twenty-year prison sentence in ""Blink of an Eye.""
* Carl uses the phrase ""a mirror universe,"" the first canon use of that term.
* Carl then goes ahead and reveals himself to be the Guardian of Forever, a temporal sentry introduced in ""City on the Edge of Forever,"" returning in ""Yesteryear,"" and curiously not seen again before June 28, 2018. To this point the Guardian was only known to exist on one unnamed planet in the Alpha Quadrant.
* The Guardian's real voice is taken from ""City,"" and is that of Bart LaRue, who provided a number of ""Non-Corporeal Being of the Week"" voices during TOS.
* Book solves the technical dilemma using subspace relays, a common doohickey inserted wherever there are problems with subspace communications over long distances.
* Georgiou is randomly thrown back in time in a transparent contrivance to set up her own spinoff. A similar device was used in another backdoor pilot, ""Assignment: Earth,"" where the *Enterprise* just kinda showed up in the past so it could meet Gary Seven. A morally ambiguous character magically escaping the main story could also describe Loki in *Avengers: Endgame* (Loki himself is getting his own spinoff), and speaking of ""Endgame,"" Trek has an even longer history of using time travel for dubious narrative purposes.","Canon References -

&gt;THE MILKY WAY - Her Imperial Highness, Mother of the Fatherland, Overlord of Vulcan, Dominus of Qo’noS, Regina Andor, Emperor Philippa Georgiou Augustus Iaponius Centarius has a choice to make.  
&gt;  
&gt;The long just reign of the venerated Terran emperor has begun its final act and Her Magnificence is the only soul strong enough to decide: How will she live? And How will she die?  
&gt;  
&gt;If the Emperor chooses life, it will be away from her beloved Empire, with no hope of return. She will be without her adoring subjects and the fortunate few whom the Emperor has allowed to know her personally. She will not know when or where she is destined, but Her Highness is unafraid because Her Highness fears nothing.

&gt;  
&gt;Imperial scientists believe the sensation would be a pain similar to multiple stabbings with dull, flaming machetes while suffering third-degree chemical burns and hemlock poisoning, and then being left to be eaten alive by desperate, greedy, starving wild animals.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Emperor's strength, power, speed, pose, intelligence, beauty, tactical skills, political mastery, wealth, stealth, wisdom, and resilience allowed her to accrue great power and influence across the galaxy. No one has survived so long or so well as Her Majesty in a hostile universe.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Emperor is the smartest genius in the galaxy. There is no one smarter, and there never will be. Therefore, whatever fate the Emperor chooses, her choice will be correct, for herself and for the Empire. And thus the Emperor's reign will have ended, and the Empire will mourn her loss.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Empire reminds all loyal citizens that the Empire continues. The Empire outlives the Emperor. Conserving allegiance to the Empire brings honor and prosperity. Disloyalty to the Empire is punishable by death. Failure to be seen properly mourning the Emperor is punishable by demotion, imprisonment, enslavement, or death.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Emperor's successor will be named at the end of the battle royale concluding the ten-day program on the throne world, marking the official end of the Imperial grieving period. Participation is mandatory for all \[...\]

&gt;  
&gt;The Jenolan, bound for the colony on Norpin V, did not reach its destination, Norpin colony authorities, following Federation protocol, reported the Jenolan conditionally overdue six hours after the scheduled arrival time. Once the Jenolan was declared officially overdue, a standard retracing of the vessel's sublight path was undertaken. Norpin officials and Starfleet Command, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, report no debris were found, and no natural or unnatural signs of conventional weapons or known destructive phenomenon was detected.

0,"I've recently re-watched TNG, and I have to say, I'm impressed at how well the computers there have aged. They certainly weren't perfect, but for the most part, they remain believable. I'm currently watching DS9, and I've realized that their computers haven't aged as well, and the reason is that better technology was available for the set builders.

DS9 shows more of the screens to the audience than TNG did. We see a lot more video and animations on the DS9 computers than we did on the TNG ones. The result is that DS9 computers look have a 1990s look to them, but somehow, TNG doesn't. This makes me wonder how the technology in shows like Discovery will look 30 years from now.

I do not believe TOS aged as well as TNG in this respect, but considering how old that show is, I think it did remarkably well. My favorite example has to be the Spock-O-Scope. From a set design standpoint, it was a box with a blue light in it. But to the audience, it can display anything it needs to. A computer screen can't look dated if it's never actually shown to the audience.","Star Trek computers, and how dated they look now",i ve recently re watched tng  and i have to say  i m impressed at how well the computers there have aged  they certainly weren t perfect  but for the most part  they remain believable  i m currently watching ds9  and i ve realized that their computers haven t aged as well  and the reason is that better technology was available for the set builders ds9 shows more of the screens to the audience than tng did  we see a lot more video and animations on the ds9 computers than we did on the tng ones  the result is that ds9 computers look have a 1990s look to them  but somehow  tng doesn t  this makes me wonder how the technology in shows like discovery will look 30 years from now i do not believe tos aged as well as tng in this respect  but considering how old that show is  i think it did remarkably well  my favorite example has to be the spock o scope  from a set design standpoint  it was a box with a blue light in it  but to the audience  it can display anything it needs to  a computer screen can t look dated if it s never actually shown to the audience star trek computers  and how dated they look now
0,"I don't watch the ""next time on"" so if that addresses any of this please don't spoil it for me.

While watching the last episode of Discovery I realized we don't know how long a Kelpien lives. Up until Discovery time traveled Kelpiens were killed before living to an old age. Sure 31st century Starfleet knows the lifespan of a Kelpien (a current Federation member), but not Discovery. Not even Georgiou knows. &gt;!Well... knew!&lt;.

So why is this relevant? Well we know that one seemingly young Kelpien was on a ship at the center of The Burn 125 years ago. If it were a Vulcan the possibility that that individual is still alive is more then plausible. And this Kelpien was a doctor! The ship is still working (or at least transmitting) after 125 years, suggesting something is maintaining it.

The ship designs are kinda weird and honestly, 8 episodes in and the show itself is kinda boring. Seems like a common trend that first seasons of trek are always somewhat problematic but even that put aside we then get to Jadzia Dax.

Everyone talks about how Enterprise overly sexualizes T'pol but what the hell is happening in DS9 and Dax? Every episode so far has a throwaway line of how gorgeous and alluring Jadzia is. If its not Dr. Bashir its Quark and of course everyone assumes Sisko must have had relations with her given their past...

Having exausted the whole of Trek, I was thinking of trying Babylon 5. I have heard that the producers of said show accused the execs of paramount of ripping out their idea for a space station show and gluing ""Star Trek"" on the name, and I've also seen multiple statements throught the years saying that the two shows would steal a lot from one another. 

I'm conflicted, because many years ago I tried to get into it and after 2 or 3 episodes it didn't really stick. BUT, the same thing happened with DS(, and whe I tried again later I loved it.

My 2020 Definitive Ranking of Every* Star Trek Series** From Worst to Best!

Before I begin, you may be asking, ""Why?"" Well, as it turns out, eliminating almost all social or external activity for about 9 months gives you an incredible amount of time to watch*** literally every episode of Star Trek. Plus, most of them were added to Netflix this year, so that made it pretty easy to just hit play.

Now, let's get to the list:

Ranked from worst to best based on modern watchability:

8.Enterprise (2001-2005)

7.The Original Series (1966-1969)

6.Voyager (1995-2001)

5.Discovery (2017 - present)

4.The Next Generation (1987-1994)

3.Picard (2020 - present)

2.Lower Decks (2020 - Present)

1.Deep Space 9 (1993-1999)

I can hear you say, ""How dare you rank X series at Y place!"" I will discuss each series in detail below, so you can review my reasoning. Also, this is based on my opinion, and you can feel free to disagree in the comments.
You may also wonder if my opinions were biased by the order in which I watched the series, to which I say, sure, that's entirely possible. Here's the order I watched them, starting in February and ending today: TNG - DS9 - Voyager - Picard - Lower Decks - TOS. Discovery was watched concurrently with several series, as it was released.

Series comments:

Deep Space 9: DS9 might be the most non-standard Star Trek that was ever released, and it quickly became my favorite. Not only were the characters complex and well developed, the scripts were unique, the storylines were a nice combination of episodic and serialized, and its themes continue to hold up. It was heartbreaking, funny, exciting, thought-provoking, and world-building. It was just the best combination of everything you'd want from Star Trek. If you were to go watch one series, this is the one I recommend. 

Lower Decks: The most-recently debuted, and only the second animated series, Lower Decks might seem like an underdog for the top rankings, but for someone whose media consumption has been steeped in Star Trek, I was the exact target audience. Literally every line of the script is dripping with reference and nostalgia, combined with some universally appreciable comedy. This isn't going to be for everyone, but it has been one that I have thoroughly appreciated.

Picard: This is where the list starts to get tough, and I could absolutely see Picard, TNG, and Discovery moving around in my ranking as more episodes are released. Picard has only one season so far, but that season was one of the most well-produced serialized seasons I've seen. It had a nice balance of nostalgia and new storylines. It continued the trend towards darker and more dramatic sets, and I hope future seasons continue the trend.

The Next Generation: I'll admit, this is the series that had the most nostalgia for me, though I was too young to have watched it while it aired. TNG undoubtedly kicked off the second era of Star Trek, which was what I grew up on. To be honest, I had this ranked higher before I watched TOS. I once read a criticism of TNG that so many of its scripts were just re-skinned TOS scripts, and, unfortunately, that was pretty true. Especially for the first 1.5 seasons, and for a large number of exploration-related episodes. That being said, TNG's uniqueness were in the episodes that were similar to Deep Space 9. TNG's Enterprise was a ship of diplomacy, as opposed to exploration, and contained families and more complex relationships, and that led to a much more well-developed feel for the series.

Discovery: TNG and Discovery are probably the closest between any two series on this list. They are both good, for different reasons. Discovery is the first Star Trek series to make a full transition from an episodic to a serialized format, and while its first season may have had some isolated storylines, most of the show follows a single thread. The characters are great, and the story is pretty good, though the visuals definitely draw from the Kelvin timeline Star Trek films (read: lens flares), which is not necessarily a bad thing. The 3rd season is currently airing, and it is certainly the best so far, though it also portrays a very different world, that is characterized by its scarcity. Ultimately, I think it's very possible that the series will rise above TNG, but I think only time will tell.

Voyager: This show suffered from living in the shadow of TNG. Unfortunately, I think the transition from the plentiful Federation of TNG to the stark shortage of resources in Voyager just felt too different. The series was good, and some of its characters stand out as Star Trek all-stars, and Janeway is probably the most under-rated captain. It's stories weren't particularly unique, for the most part, and most of the show suffered from the largest downside of TNG, rehashing old themes.

The Original Series: For some, this will be the most controversial part of my list. I can hear it already, ""it was good for it's time."" Here's the problem: This isn't the 1960's anymore. In one sentence, it was sexist, campy, tired, on-the-nose, groundbreaking, and did I mention sexist? Listen, I watched every* Star Trek series that's ever been made, and I made this list based on which series I think people should watch today, not by time-traveling back to when the show first aired. It doesn't hold up as well as many wish it did, and most of the ""best"" TOS wasn't actually in the 3 seasons that aired, but in the films, which I am not including in my rankings**. 

Enterprise: Most of the people that say they liked this series, are confusing it, because of its name, with TOS. Coming out of TNG, DS9, and Voyager, it was just... disappointing. There's a lot that went wrong here, but I think the influence of 9/11 on American culture and television stands out. It took a 180 degree turn on portraying a future without prejudice (in fact most of the main characters are prejudiced in one form or another), and its theme song sucked. Yes, I'm going to lay at least some of the blame on the theme. Just listen to it, it's just bad.
 
So there you go, 757 episodes of Star Trek later, I hope you enjoyed the fruits of my ""labors"" over the past 9 months of quarantine. Instead of learning Mandarin, picking up the guitar, or reading more books, I watched all of Star trek, and with that burden of knowledge, I bestow up on you, 

My 2020 Definitive Ranking of Every* Star Trek Series** From Worst to Best!

*Excluding Star Trek: The Animated Series. Feel free to make a case for why I should have watched it below, but I have yet to hear one.
**Films and movies are a subject for another list. I think the procuction budgets, format, and timing constraints make films significantly different from content developed for a TV series. Also, they weren't on Netflix.
***It's important to know that a significant number of episodes were consumed in an almost podcast-like format while I went on solitary walks to get out of the house during quarantine. This turned out not to have been as much of a hindrance, especially for the older series, considering the amount of reused sets and visuals.",A Quarantine Obsession Becomes the 2020 Definitive Star

One of the best elements of the long story arcs that DS9 develops (in contrast to the episodic nature of other ST shows) is how it can take a minor character and make him relevant.

Damar was Gul Dukat's right hand man when Dukat had been demoted and was serving as captain of a single ship. He was barely a named character. But he was there. 

When Dukat takes control of Cardassia allying with the Dominion Damar remains as his faithful ally and right hand man. He's marked by his loyalty to Dukat, the man that brought him up through the ranks. Damar is a proud cardassian and prone to drinking, but he does his duty to Dukat with great dilligence.

We see the first real development of this character when Dukat orders him to ""befriend"" his daughter, and we see how Damar is at a complete loss when dealing with civilians in any kind fashion. He's used to giving orders as a soldier, not being polite. He tries to convince her that her father is a great man, but she won't listen to him. Later when he finds out that Ziel betrayed the Cardassians he kills her, and struggles to get Dukat out of the station in vain. 

With Dukat gone Damar, this character that started out as almost irrelevant is now the puppet leader of the Cardassian Union. The weight of the murder, the lost of his mentor, and the responsabilities of guiding an entire country through a brutal struggle that is killing millions of Cardassians takes its tool on Damar. He starts to drink, and his continuous loss of power within the Dominion only exacerbates the situation. He's now a shadow of his former self. 

When the Dominion allies with the Breen Damar finally realizes that the Cardassians have lost favor completely, and that they are now themselves a subjugated people, much like they had once enslaved Bajor. Throughout the last arc of the series, Damar is a main character, betraying the Dominion and fighting for Cardassian Liberation.

The relationship between Dukat and Damar is also very interesting. He seems to have been the only truly genuine friend of Dukat, and both cared for each other, even when Dukat was already in full evil prophet mode. Damar probably saw Dukat as his mentor, and Dukat saw in Damar the respect that he so desperately craved from everyone else. 

TL:DR  - DS9 took a side character that was barely worth a name and (through 5 seasons) made him into a conflicted and loyal soldier thrust into power, devoured by depression that turned him to drinking before finally redeeming himself in a way.",I love how they developed the character of Damar in DS9,i m finishing my first rewatch of ds9 in many years  since the first time i saw it it became my favorite piece of st by a mile  one of the best elements of the long story arcs that ds9 develops  in contrast to the episodic nature of other st shows  is how it can take a minor character and make him relevant damar was gul dukat s right hand man when dukat had been demoted and was serving as captain of a single ship  he was barely a named character  but he was there  when dukat takes control of cardassia allying with the dominion damar remains as his faithful ally and right hand man  he s marked by his loyalty to dukat  the man that brought him up through the ranks  damar is a proud cardassian and prone to drinking  but he does his duty to dukat with great dilligence we see the first real development of this character when dukat orders him to  befriend  his daughter  and we see how damar is at a complete loss when dealing with civilians in any kind fashion  he s used to giving orders as a soldier  not being polite  he tries to convince her that her father is a great man  but she won t listen to him  later when he finds out that ziel betrayed the cardassians he kills her  and struggles to get dukat out of the station in vain  with dukat gone damar  this character that started out as almost irrelevant is now the puppet leader of the cardassian union  the weight of the murder  the lost of his mentor  and the responsabilities of guiding an entire country through a brutal struggle that is killing millions of cardassians takes its tool on damar  he starts to drink  and his continuous loss of power within the dominion only exacerbates the situation  he s now a shadow of his former self  when the dominion allies with the breen damar finally realizes that the cardassians have lost favor completely  and that they are now themselves a subjugated people  much like they had once enslaved bajor  throughout the last arc of the series  damar is a main character  betraying the dominion and fighting for cardassian liberation the relationship between dukat and damar is also very interesting  he seems to have been the only truly genuine friend of dukat  and both cared for each other  even when dukat was already in full evil prophet mode  damar probably saw dukat as his mentor  and dukat saw in damar the respect that he so desperately craved from everyone else  tl dr    ds9 took a side character that was barely worth a name and  through 5 seasons  made him into a conflicted and loyal soldier thrust into power  devoured by depression that turned him to drinking before finally redeeming himself in a way i love how they developed the character of damar in ds9

0,"My road to Star Trek fandom was (I think) a bit unusual and yet it has greatly influenced my life. 

The main reason my road to Star Trek was a bit odd was that it was 2013 and I was a 15 year-old Chinese girl. Not the target demographic of Star Trek nor the right time frame.
My brother was watching Star Trek (2009) on TV and tbh I thought it looked a bit rubbish. Rather than sitting through the film, I half listened and wikipedia-ed the synopsis. This led me down the Star Trek rabbit-hole... I was surprised how long it had been running for and how many incarnations there were. I then went on Youtube and found: the Picard Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6oUz1v17Uo). I loved it. I had no idea who the characters were but I kept listening. I eventually took the plunge and watched TNG what a great first episode! I was hooked. Hooked enough to get through the rather dubious season 1.

After that, I watched every incarnation, read loads of books, wrote a few terrible fanfictions, and chose to study Physics at university. Star Trek not only kindled my love of science, but also Shakespeare and humanity.

I did the same with my [TNG reviews](https://vengonofuoridallefottutepareti.com/2020/09/05/star-trek-the-next-generation-tng-reviews-of-a-selection-of-episodes/). This was 1990s TV and there's plenty to track!

1×12: Vortex  
Double The X-Files! The fugitive, Cliff De Young, was Doctor Nemman in the pilot episode, and the pursuing twins, Randy Oglesby, was the snake-handling reverend in Signs &amp; Wonders!  


1×14: The Storyteller

2×20: The Maquis, Part I / 2×21: The Maquis, Part II  
We have seen Admiral Nechayev several times in TNG already, but it is not until this episode that I realized that Natalija Nogulich was the one that had first been cast as Mulder’s informant “X” in The X-Files, before being recast by Steven Williams!  


2×22: The Wire  
The leader of the Obsidian Order (Enabran Tain), Paul Dooley, was the spooky incestuous father in the Millennium episode The Well-Worn Lock.  


2×25: Tribunal

Frank Military (the hot-tempered gang leader BC) was the “Son” in the unholy trinity of vampires in The X-Files‘ 3!  


3×24: Shakaar  
Among Kira’s ex-comrades there was William Lucking (who was Roky in perhaps The X-Files‘ best episode, José Chung’s From Outer Space, and a detective in Millennium).  


4×08: Little Green Men  
There’s a sort of genre TV reunion-before-the-fact here, with the scientist being Conor O’Farrell (will be in the main cast of Dark Skies as Lt. Albano just a year later) and the nurse being Meghan Gallagher (will be co-star Catherine Black in MillenniuM also just a year later)!  


4×18: Rules of Engagement  
T’Lara was Deborah Strang, who was the unfortunate genetically predisposed killer B.J. Morrow in The X-Files‘ Aubrey.  


4×24: The Quickening

Kurtwood Smith (Thrax) was the memorable Detective Patterson in The X-Files gargoyles episode, Grotesque!

The beautiful guest, Dey Young, was unrecognizable in The X-Files‘ Born Again as the generic housewife whose dead husband is reincarnated in their daughter.

The redshirt who, well, dies, was Joseph Fuqua, who played the (young version of) the inventor of time travelling in an episode of The X-Files, Synchrony!

The rough soldier was Patrick Kilpatrick, who appeared in season 8 of The X-Files, Surekill. The desperate soldier was Raymond Cruz, who appeared in season 4 of The X-Files, El Mundo Gira, and as Tuco in Breaking Bad!

0,"Hi folks!  


I'm about to dive into Star Trek for the first time - all of Star Trek, right from the original series. Up until now, I've only ever seen odd scenes or the very occasional TNG episode that my parents might have had on in the background. The idea of Star Trek has always sounded super appealing to me though; I love me some sci-fi, world building, philosophy and ethics.  


I also run a YouTube channel, and wondered if there was an opportunity there to record something interesting from the perspective of someone who is diving into Star Trek for the first time. That's what I'm here to ask - as a Star Trek buff, someone who knows and loves the shows, what would you find interesting to hear from someone coming in with fresh eyes (if anything?)  


I could come at this from a few different angles. Something more akin to a straightforward review of each episode and what I thought of it; it could be something more directly philosophical where I discuss my thoughts or solutions on the presented dilemma (for applicable episodes, I realise that's not all of what Star Trek is); it could even be something a little gamified/puzzle solving, where I try to draw out a map of the ship/galaxy/historical timeline as accurately as possible (I have no idea how feasible that is). That's not an exhaustive list, and I come to the subreddit since someone who has seen Trek might be able to think of things I'd simply have no idea about.   


I guess I'll also finish with a broader question: if you could forget everything about Star Trek and go back and watch it all again like it was the very first time, is there anything *you'd* like to do with that opportunity?  


Thanks for your time folks, I'm sure I'll be counting myself amonst the Trekkies in no time!

0,"I'm aware that writers came up with one big explanation that got something to do with Picard's knowledge about ""theta-band carrier waves"", but still, it's a weak excuse to send one of the best Federation captains on a mission like this. If you want your team to successfully complete a stealth mission or at least to have higher chances, you need some kind of badass spy, who has experience in operations like that. Not a bald diplomatic starship captain who long passed his physical prime. 

From a screenwriting standpoint, it's the weakest part of the story in my opinion. However, from the inside perspective (inside Star Trek universe), it comes off like a setup to get rid of Picard by someone on the Federation side. Mostly, because of a scene at the beginning, when it was established that Picard didn't have much of a choice. This is kinda suspicious.

By the way, some people think that Riker was kinda an asshole in this episode, and yes he was to a degree, but I can understand why. It ain't easy to keep your composure when you work with a guy like Captain Jellico. He proved himself as a great captain, but his blunt taskmaster approach can really mess with the crew's morale.

So what do you think?","Why did Picard personally go on a mission in ""Chain of Command""?

0,"From all the little things that bother me with Trek (how pop references are restricted to humanity, the Federation is basically the US, language is never a barrier), the thing that gets me thinking the most is how the Holosuite is basically a GOD machine.

Forget the technical details that one of those machines is capable of creating vast simulated spaces packed with people in such a life-like manner that would utterly baffle any computer scientist. Each of these Holosuites is a Supercomputer that likely has a software and hardware more powerful than every piece of machinery in NASA combined. AND QUARK HAS 3 OF THOSE! 

What really gets me thinking is how the characters in these Holosuites are basically ALIVE! They are so perfectly simulated, with so much memory and programing going into each character, that they utterly believe they are real people? And I ask you, if you are indistinguishable from a real human, and truly believe you are a real human? **What is the difference?** They believe they feel emotion, so what's the difference between that and actually feeling it? Isn't the human brain just tricked by a series of impulses and substances much in the same manner? 

And then we get to more complicated characters, such as **The Doctor and Vic Fontaine.** THEY ARE SENTIENT! What the hell is the difference by that point? They are fully living organisms that feel emotions, have memories, and ponder their very existence. 

If Data can be regarded as an individual, than so should they. If anything, a sentient character of a Holosuite is far more of an individual than Data, as they are capable of experiencing things Data cannot, such as emotion.

0,"One of the things in star trek that annoys me is that starfleet has way too many rigid and ridiculous rules.  It's become and ineffectual bureaucracy.  It makes it difficult for the crew of a starship to actually make a difference.  The prime directive is one rule that annoys me.  There should be exceptions to the prime directive to be able to interfere to prevent planetary disasters, etc.  Interfering for personal gain or for the benifit of the federation should be prohibited.  Then you have the temporal accord.  The rules against time travel.  Usually not using time travel is a good idea.  But there are exceptions to every rule.  The temporal accord didn't exist in star trek four but if it had and kirk had followed it earth would have been wiped out.  

So interference should be judged on a case by case basis as to whether or not it's justified.  Having rules that say you can't do something no matter the situation is just not practical.  That is one thing I like about the original series.  And I don't like the original series.  But they weren't bogged down in rules and regulations as much.  So they were able to get more done.  Eventually starfleet is going to have so many rules that it will become a totally ineffective organization.

0,"As a pretty big fan of both franchises, the Trek fan in me gets a teeny bit jealous when I watch The Mandalorian. A lot of it comes down to the reverence the people behind the scenes seem to have for the source material and the greater franchise. Probably the biggest thing from Mandalorian that I'd want to carry over onto Star Trek is the careful attention to the visual canon. I know it's a rather nitpicky thing but sometimes it really does bug me when I notice the small changes they make in the newer shows with things that don't really need them. The extra vertical ridge that now sits on the Talosians' heads. The new makeup they use for the Orions. Phasers shooting out bolts instead of beams. Pike's wheelchair being pretty much completely different. Even stuff like the interfaces they use. In Mandalorian, everything just looks right. The locations and sets look authentic to the established canon. The visual design for every single alien species is consistent with how they looked, or if they're new, how they would have looked. Even the various interfaces on consoles and ships didn't get an update to make them more ""appropriate"" for the quality of television today. They deliberately chose to stay consistent to what's been established. Those crappy vector graphics do way more for me than all the hologram stuff on Discovery. I know it's not exactly a 1:1 situation. Obviously the 1966 standards for a TV show were very different than for a 1977 motion picture. I just wish they'd use a little more care, perhaps even restraint. Star Trek: Enterprise walked that line pretty gracefully, mostly (the CGI Gorn was pretty awful).

Since we know what effects Trellium D had on T’Pol, couldn’t we infer that this could have had something to do with her initial attraction to Trip? This would have been her first exposure to the compound, and would have had no idea how it would affect her. Perhaps there was a very slight degradation of her neural pathways just being in its presence, and then began to associate that sensation with being near Trip.

0,"This plotline of Stamets finding himself an unwitting father figure to Adira is actually my favorite thing happening in Disco season 3. I think it's very cool how they can simultaneously not show any discrimination towards Stamets and Culber ( or Reno) for being gay or Adira for being nonbinary, but also depict a queer found family among the four or them that feels familiar and real (at least to me as someone who has been peripheral to a lot of those families). 

It's also just really great for Stamet's growth as a character. Tilly was looking up to him as a mentor in the first two seasons and while they had their moments she ended up finding better mentors in Michael and Saru. Paul was just too cold and wasn't able to really warm to her when she needed him to. But Adira is an actual teenager and that's clearly got Stamets way outside his comfort zone, which is when Anthony Rapp really shines as an actor. I don't know if the Instagram posts are canon, but the idea in this one [https://www.instagram.com/p/CIgXz1TonO1/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIgXz1TonO1/) that Stamets is trying to be a better ""dad"" to Adira than his dad was to him just really hits home with me.

I hope they do more with this relationship, and with Adira dealing with all the memories of the Tal symbiont and especially Grey's memories, before the season is over.

0,"I know there have been threads like this in the past and it's pretty low-effort but whatever.

I'm interested for ideas and differing opinions.

TOS:

Overrated: The Carbomite maneuver.

I don't get the appeal. It was much too slow and boring.

Underrated: The Squire of Gothos

(It's so great; a predecessor of Q and I like the twist at the end. Maybe this ep is well liked, but I didn't find it in any best-of lists)

(I've only seen the first 20 episodes and the pilot of TOS)

&amp;#x200B;

TNG

Overrated: 

Data's Day: (it doesn't bring anything new to Data's character and I don't like how it portrays Keiko)

Who watches the watchers: I really don't think Picard arguments why it's wrong to interfere hold up AT ALL. There are people (Troi and Riker) at risk and he already has (even involuntaryly) greatly influenced these people; they're thinking of him as a god. 

Picard clinging to a Dogma instead of thinking something through case for case is the reason why he's rated so low on my best captain list 

Any Q episode (this includes Tapestry): Q is maybe my least favourite character in the whole Trek verse

Underrated: 

The High Ground

Premptive Strike

In both episodes the conflicts aren't portrayed as black and white, something that is unfortunately often the case with TNG

Rightful heir: This episode is really neat

&amp;#x200B;

DS9:

Overrated: this is hard, because all episodes that are generally hold in greatest esteem are all really that good, so I'll nominate all mirror universe episodes, because I just really hate the mirror universe concept

Underrated: ..Nor the Battle to the strong

I don't think it isn't well-liked, but I think it deserves to be under the top 10 ds9 episodes. Dealing with similiar themes, it left a bigger impact on me than ""The siege of AR-588""

&amp;#x200B;

VOY:

Overrated: Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy

I'm baffled that this epsiode is on so many TOP episodes list. I think it isn't really fun and it isn't endearing. The doctor dreaming that every female main cast member is into him gets old veeery fast. Don't get me wrong, you can make this joke once, maybe twice, but there are multiple scenes with it, so it feels excessive. It's an episode that I feel like skipping. I just can't stand it. I prefer Fair haven and maybe even Spirit Folk to it and I loooathe these episodes.

&amp;#x200B;

Underrated: 

\-Prototype, I don't know if my nostalgia is blinding me, (Prototype was one of the first episodes of Star Trek that I watched) but this episode holds up every time I watch it. It is one of the best engineer-centric episodes in the whole of Star Trek.

But I generally loove B'elanna-centric episodes, she's my favourite character and she isn't well liked in the fandom

But seriously guys; Prototype, Dreadnought, Revulsion and Juggernaut are just great episodes.

I also really like The thaw(the one with fear personified as a clown played by MIchael McKean. But I don't think The thaw is a underrated episode, it's a polarizing episodes, people hate it or love it.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't watched enogh Enterprise to comment.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't watched TAS and Lower Decks (I live in Europe and I don't pirate....yet) and I didn't finish Picard because I didn't like it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I can't rate singular Disco episodes, because all of them build more or less one season arc. This gets better in Season 3 though, I feel there the episodes stand more on each own, even if only weakly.

i also don't know which episodes of Discovery are liked by the fanbase.

People seem to like Magic to make the sanest man go mad, I like it too but I prefer Lethe over it.

I think season 3 of Discovery is overrated. It is the best season, but it is only slightly better than the others.

Despite my problem with their logic, I love the Vulcan species, and I wanted to make some changes on their design, like making their ears bigger and able to move to convey 'emotions' once they are typically stoic (like minimoys ears). Another problem I have with Star Trek's alien culture, is how 'unified' it is, I haven't watched everything Star Trek has to offer yet, but as for this moment, I think that the aliens lack the diversity we have on Earth, for example, in Vulcan, you have the Surak's followers and the folks who are against Surak's teachings.... is there any Vulcan nation that has nothing to do with Surak at all? I miss the 'nations' element from the aliens.

0,"Ok, so this is not the typical anti-sjw stuff we have all heard that a million times, and I will say there is a relationship to this. But it's kind of the opposite. I feel like they are crapping all over LBGTQ+ rights with them, especially Adira. 

First why do they have to put the two LBGTQ+ people together? This doesn't bother me a lot, but it does feel very contrived and silly. Stamet's experience as a gay man in the 23rd century has nothing to do with a non-binary character in the 32nd century. Ok in universe it's kind of because of Adira's fascination with the spore drive, but then why do they never seem to do anything except talk about their emotions and confusion. Goodness me, get some freaking Star Trek in there with the Melo-drama please. 

Secondly Why did he volunteer her as able to write the algorithm. If he KNOWs she can and is trying to get her to step up why doesn't he tell her to say this? It felt like that whole scene was just a set up for the later They/Them pronouns discussion. On that not why was Adira scared to tell anyone about it before Stamets? Do you mean to tell me that in 1,200 years we haven't made enough progress on the trans acceptance movement on Earth that it's even more taboo than now? What ever happened to the argument they have made in the past about doing this. In the future people don't care that Picard is bald or about interracial kisses. This is doing the EXACT opposite of that. I get that it's supposed to kind of be a dystopian future rather than the Utopia of the 23rd and 24th centuries, but if this is the case you need to at least hint at some reason why we might have slid backwards, maybe some new religious movement or an under-population crisis after the burn. But this is a dying society, not a reborn society. Also she ALWAYS felt this way but didn't feel OK telling ANYONE? Really? Not even their Trans Boyfriend?

Then to get away from the woke aspect of it entirely, right after this conversation they are suddenly in a music room together. Stamet's is on the Piano Adira on Cello, then after she plays he says ""I didn't know you played Cello"". Then WHY DID YOU GUYS GO TO THE MUSIC ROOM TOGETHER? You didn't question this when she got up and walked to the music room and you sat on the piano to accompany her? Really? Not when she picked up the Cello, rosined up her bow and got ready to play?

Look Star Trek has and hopefully always will be a perfect medium to push progressive ideas. It's the future where our petty issues of today are presumably resolved.

0,"Hi!

I have never seen a single episode of Star Trek in my life (not even any of the films) and have been thinking that it might be fun to start watching the show. However I'm finding where to start with the show pretty intimidating. I don't want to watch hundreds of episodes (I don't have all the time in the world), so am just looking for the best point to jump onto the show.

I think I want to start with Star Trek: The Next Generation, as I like Patrick Stewart and am concerned that the original series might just be a bit too dated for me. But should I just start with Series 1 episode 1 of TNG? Or is it one of those shows which only really goods good after a couple of seasons? Do I need to watch all the episodes in order, or could I just google ""Best Star Trek TNG episodes"" and watch those?

Thank you in advance.",Where to start with Star Trek,hi i have never seen a single episode of star trek in my life  not even any of the films  and have been thinking that it might be fun to start watching the show  however i m finding where to start with the show pretty intimidating  i don t want to watch hundreds of episodes  i don t have all the time in the world   so am just looking for the best point to jump onto the show i think i want to start with star trek  the next generation  as i like patrick stewart and am concerned that the original series might just be a bit too dated for me  but should i just start with series 1 episode 1 of tng  or is it one of those shows which only really goods good after a couple of seasons  do i need to watch all the episodes in order  or could i just google  best star trek tng episodes  and watch those thank you in advance where to start with star trek

0,"This is basically just gonna be a place for me to dump random stuff about the series that's on my mind atm.

Seeing the somewhat polarized reaction to Discovery has been a strange experience. I've come out of every season of the show impressed. And I think there are a few Discovery episodes that rival even the best episodes of TNG. That being The Sound of Thunder and Unification III.

Is it as good as TNG? Absolutely not. It was never going to be. As unfortunate as it might be for us. I don't believe that a 90s era style of Trek show could ever work in the modern entertainment climate. I've always seen Discovery as an attempt to create a show which was capable of becoming popular today while also being true to the series' origins. I can only imagine how difficult this must be to do. When you do something like that, you're always going to piss people off. Everyone has their own version of what Star Trek is ""about"" or what it means, so its kind of impossible to please even the majority of the community. And even on a more objective level, this kind of transition will always leave some unfortunate artifacts in the show; I see the admittedly very messy tangle of plot lines that plague the first two seasons of evidence of that.

I also find the reaction to several of the series' more political choices to be somewhat... perplexing. I know its been said before, but Star Trek is and always has been a progressive franchise. First interracial kiss, first same-sex kiss. Why anyone was upset about Star Trek continuing to be that way with the gay couple and now the non-binary character is beyond me, and makes me question why they're watching the series in the first place. The stock response I hear to that is ""oh well they didn't push it in our faces back then."" Honestly, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't really see much of a difference between the way that previous series handled their more progressive areas. 

They barely even acknowledge that there's a same sex couple in the show. There wasn't some big reveal there, there just was a gay couple and that was that. The non-binary scene was literally: ""I feel like more of a they then a she"" ""oh okay I'll call you they then"". Contrast that to the anti-capitalist speech that Picard goes on during First Contact. If a single scene of someone asking for their pronouns to be respected is pushing it in our faces, but Picard literally going on a speech about how much better the future is because we got rid of capitalism is not. Then I just don't understand what the problem is. 

In conclusion... fandoms confuse me. I often find the very critical and emotional nature of reactions to recent entries in many franchises to be annoying, and pretty unwarranted. It really just seems like certain people are trying to find things to be angry about. That doesn't mean there isn't room for constructive criticism, but this kind of criticism seems pretty emotional and baseless. Although I do have a tendency to find things to enjoy in most of the entertainment I consume, so maybe I'm just particularly optimistic and minimizing flaws in my head.",Some thoughts on modern Trek.,this is basically just gonna be a place for me to dump random stuff about the series that s on my mind atm seeing the somewhat polarized reaction to discovery has been a strange experience  i ve come out of every season of the show impressed  and i think there are a few discovery episodes that rival even the best episodes of tng  that being the sound of thunder and unification iii is it as good as tng  absolutely not  it was never going to be  as unfortunate as it might be for us  i don t believe that a 90s era style of trek show could ever work in the modern entertainment climate  i ve always seen discovery as an attempt to create a show which was capable of becoming popular today while also being true to the series  origins  i can only imagine how difficult this must be to do  when you do something like that  you re always going to piss people off  everyone has their own version of what star trek is  about  or what it means  so its kind of impossible to please even the majority of the community  and even on a more objective level  this kind of transition will always leave some unfortunate artifacts in the show  i see the admittedly very messy tangle of plot lines that plague the first two seasons of evidence of that i also find the reaction to several of the series  more political choices to be somewhat    perplexing  i know its been said before  but star trek is and always has been a progressive franchise  first interracial kiss  first same sex kiss  why anyone was upset about star trek continuing to be that way with the gay couple and now the non binary character is beyond me  and makes me question why they re watching the series in the first place  the stock response i hear to that is  oh well they didn t push it in our faces back then   honestly  i don t know what you re talking about  i don t really see much of a difference between the way that previous series handled their more progressive areas  they barely even acknowledge that there s a same sex couple in the show  there wasn t some big reveal there  there just was a gay couple and that was that  the non binary scene was literally   i feel like more of a they then a she   oh okay i ll call you they then   contrast that to the anti capitalist speech that picard goes on during first contact  if a single scene of someone asking for their pronouns to be respected is pushing it in our faces  but picard literally going on a speech about how much better the future is because we got rid of capitalism is not  then i just don t understand what the problem is  in conclusion    fandoms confuse me  i often find the very critical and emotional nature of reactions to recent entries in many franchises to be annoying  and pretty unwarranted  it really just seems like certain people are trying to find things to be angry about  that doesn t mean there isn t room for constructive criticism  but this kind of criticism seems pretty emotional and baseless  although i do have a tendency to find things to enjoy in most of the entertainment i consume  so maybe i m just particularly optimistic and minimizing flaws in my head some thoughts on modern trek

0,"So I'm a massive TNG fan and I have enjoyed Disco by and large until 2 things dawned on me as to why my interest is waning this season. 

1: They are not fleshing out the bridge crew at all. I don't really know any names or arcs with the exception of Detmer and frankly not enough of her. I would prefer some episodes based around these characters to open up the show and kinda drop the Michael/Burn centred story for a bit so I can get to know the rest of the crew.

2: Where are all the lead men? I support inclusion and representation of strong women, different races and species, LGTB and gender fluidity but season 3 seems lob sided and I personally don't feel drawn to any male member and I miss that. Book seems jammed in only for Michael's sake, Saru is still very soft for a captain (and not human), the Admiral is just a dick so the only 2 left are Colber and Stamets but they don't get enough screen time either.

I wonder if I'm being a snowflake here but I would like to see a more balanced show and have another Pike or Lorca type emerge as I think they are really being missed this season.

0,"So I knew some of the plot points coming in because of following this sub, namely that there was a Klingon spy who had infiltrated discovery and that the captain was secretly from the mirror universe.  I also knew a lot of people had negative opinions of the show early on so I was wary.

In the first few episodes I was intrigued but I didn’t really like any of the characters save for maybe Captain Georgiou (note I’m gonna refer to prime Georgiou as captain Georgiou and mirror as emperor Georgiou).  I think the emperor did give a good critique of Burnham in one of the later episodes “you don’t follow through”.  I found Michael unbearable in the first few episodes.  They were headstrong, know-it-all, but then mopey and hateful.  They were almost the worst combination of human and Vulcan you could think of.  Intelligent and logical but their emotions took over enough to SHOOT THEIR FUCKING CAPTAIN?!  And then their emotions took over enough to be depressed about and push everyone around them away.  Seemingly it was intended from the beginning that Michael would open up more to their crew mates, and their own humanity and learn what it means to be human.  So over time I grew to like Michael.

A writing problem I had with some of the characters was that they pivoted too quickly.  Besides the security officer that they offer early on.  Like Lorca was every bit a Terran Imperial officer at first but he softens rather quickly and seemingly with no real rhyme or reason, then once in the mirror universe he immediately pivots back to mustache twirlingly evil.  This frustrates me bacause I had started to like Lorca.  I thought when he mentioned that he had attempted a coup against the emperor that he meant like he was trying to make positive changes in the empire.  NOPE!  He’s even more of a xenophobe than the emperor who genocided the Klingons and ate Kelpian for dinner?!  He was a misogynist and groomed mirror Burnham into a sexual relationship to get to the emperor?!  Dude’s just a creep.  There is a small part of me that hopes to see prime Lorca at some point and that the admiral is wrong about his inability to survive the mirror universe.

  Saru is seems to have gone from a minor role to a much more pivotal one fairly quickly.  His initial mistrust of burnham seems to be only partially founded, then it’s like he suddenly is cool with her again like a light switch.  As the season progresses I grow to really like Saru though, to the point that he’s probably my favorite character.

I’m not going to say too much else but I liked Ash Tyler’s and Michael Burnham’s relationship.  I thought they wrapped it up pretty well with their last scene together before landing on the Klingon home world.  Though I feel like it must have been devistating to Michael for Tyler to go with L’rell.

0,"So, as I have posted before, I am watching Voyager for the first time from start to finish. In Season 7, Episode 7 ""Body and Soul"" Captain Janeway stated that they completed their maintenance layover at a Maldorian Station. At the beginning of Season 7, Episode 8 ""Nightingale"" Captain Janeway stated that Lieutenant Torres has finally convinced her that they can't put off a major maintenance overhaul. What were you doing during the Maintenance layover at a Station!!!

I know what it is like to have a vehicle and a crew. I know that there are some things that the crew can do in terms of maintenance, by themselves in the middle of nowhere. But, what my crew could do to my vehicle at a maintenance bay far surpased what they could do by themselves. So what the hell are you doing Janeway? If it was in reverse order, and she touched down on a planet and performed some maintenance, then the next episode, they were passing by this station and couldn't pass up the opportunity to perform an overhaul. But, it wasn't reverse, and just goes to show another example of subpar direction.

I mean, I don't have anything against white people, but as a franchise that prides itself on moving the needle on progressive issues, I feel like having a show lead be yet again another Male amerivan was just a choice by committee. They were trying to hit the demographic button , whereas shows like ds9 and Voyager did something different. Star trek should want to be more representative, there are millions of fans who are not of the American Male persuasion, and honestly it just felt forced that here we had another white Male American saving the galaxy.

0,"Now I recognize Original Tabasco.  It's always unique given its bottle.  The orange sauce next to it makes it almost seem like Cholula Hot Sauce except that the traditional wooden knob top is missing (it seems to have the same hearty thickness as Cholula at any rate, but it could also be a hot butter-based wing sauce).


.


There is a taller third bottle though with a green top on one of the bottles.  Now it could be Tabasco Green, but I think that's a wrong guess.  The bottles are standardized on all of the tables, so why would anyone always buy the original size of one Tabasco but the larger size of the other?  If we factor out Tabasco green, then what hot sauce could it be?    


Please keep in mind that a restaurant would probably buy hot sauces by the case, so a boutique (rare) hot sauce that you might find in a hot sauce store just isn't likely.  In terms of balance given the other two heats /flavors /consistencies, it could be a sriracha sauce... but I just don't recognize the brand.

0,"So I've started trying to watch TNG as my first Trek beyond the new movies, and I know you're not supposed to watch every episode in order but I have (don't really believe in cherry picking shows. either the whole thing's largely good or it's largely bad. you can point to episodes you're not a fan of or skip stuff on rewatches but for my first run I like to get the whole thing) and I've encountered an almost uncanny valley effect with the show.  


I don't want to call the actors wooden, but they're definitely very proper. They speak very clearly, their accents impeccable and there's pretty much no slang as far as I've gotten. And the ship is just incredibly clean, the sets are very well put together but they don't really feel lived in. There's no wear and tear anywhere. And I get that the whole aesthetic of the franchise is supposed to be very pristine, but it just ends up feeling off to me. Like the world isn't lived in, and really it's just a theme park populated by puppets being paraded around before me under the pretence of humanity (or whatever race they may be). Hell, if anything Data feels like the most realistic character to me because he doesn't try and be human in the slightest, he's just very clearly robotic and there's no expectation of humanity.  


I'm really sorry if this is coming off as harsh or anything, I'm finding it hard to describe this odd feeling to others. Is this something anyone else has experienced, and does it get better as it goes or should I just watch DS9 instead as that seems to be more recommended (at least by the people I know)",TNG uncanny valley?,so i ve started trying to watch tng as my first trek beyond the new movies  and i know you re not supposed to watch every episode in order but i have  don t really believe in cherry picking shows  either the whole thing s largely good or it s largely bad  you can point to episodes you re not a fan of or skip stuff on rewatches but for my first run i like to get the whole thing  and i ve encountered an almost uncanny valley effect with the show   i don t want to call the actors wooden  but they re definitely very proper  they speak very clearly  their accents impeccable and there s pretty much no slang as far as i ve gotten  and the ship is just incredibly clean  the sets are very well put together but they don t really feel lived in  there s no wear and tear anywhere  and i get that the whole aesthetic of the franchise is supposed to be very pristine  but it just ends up feeling off to me  like the world isn t lived in  and really it s just a theme park populated by puppets being paraded around before me under the pretence of humanity  or whatever race they may be   hell  if anything data feels like the most realistic character to me because he doesn t try and be human in the slightest  he s just very clearly robotic and there s no expectation of humanity   i m really sorry if this is coming off as harsh or anything  i m finding it hard to describe this odd feeling to others  is this something anyone else has experienced  and does it get better as it goes or should i just watch ds9 instead as that seems to be more recommended  at least by the people i know tng uncanny valley

0,"So if you watched the second Star Trek film with Chris Pine in it, Kelvin timeline, ""Into Darkness"" I believe, they begin on a mission to stop a volcano from wiping out a primitive alien race that has ""Barely invented the wheel"". The easter egg here is that the planet was ""Nibiru"". On the Kelvin timeline things seem to be similar but alternate, in this Khan battle, Kirk goes into the warp core and gets irradiated instead of Spock. So perhaps this is a hidden jab at the theory that our history was altered by the aliens from Nibiru, and they were seen, possibly even influencing our religions, which is why so many cave paintings depict space craft or even an additional planet in our solar system. In ""Voyager"" season 3, a late episode in the season has the ""Voth"" which are reptilian, more evolved than us, but they left earth and lost that history.

0,"TOS - An aspirational look at a better, more enlightened future for humanity. It was about exploration and the most noble human drives. 

TNG - An updated look at a more enlightened future and an exploration of utopia. It was also about space exploration and the scientific worldview. 

DS9 - Asks the question, how do you preserve a utopia in the face of those with totally different values, and is it even worth preserving? Is it even really a utopia to begin with? The show is not about the exploration of space but about the exploration of consequences. 

Voyager - Asks, how do you maintain your values when you’re all alone and survival is paramount? Again a focus on the utopia. How enlightened are you when you’re running out of supplies and no one has your back? What are you willing to sacrifice?

Enterprise - How do you build a better future from the world we have? It showed us the early days of the utopia so that we could better relate to it. 

Discovery - Is it about a better future? Not really, especially in season 3. A sort of better future is just a backdrop, not a focus. 
Is it about exploration? Nope. That’s not really a focus either. 
Is it about us? A mirror to our social issues like so much good sci fi is? Nope, it doesn’t seem interested in commenting much beyond representation in its casting.

Live long and watch a lot of Star Trek! I have just spent the last 2 years developing the ultimate spreadsheet for Trekkies. I built it out of love for everything Star Trek and can't live without it. Basically it is an Excel Spreadsheet that tracks everything Star Trek.

**The Website Link attached is to my spreadsheet compiled in XLSPadlock, that I have been building for the last few years that acts as a detailed personal database of everything we have ever watched in the entire Star Trek Franchise.** 

The database is currently up to date and includes Lower Decks, Picard Series 1 and provision for Series 2 and Discovery 1-3 with already provision for season 4 because it has been announced. And ALL the short treks are included as well as all the episodes of After Trek for Discovery Series 1 and The Ready Room with Will Wheaton for Picard, Discovery Series 3 and the beginning, middle and end of the first series of Lower Decks.

All of the titles in the database are all hyper linked to memory alpha as well so you can check up on the details before or after you record the details about the show you just watched. Including if it is a favourite, how many times you watched it and any notes or comments you want to make.

And I have created something called MY TREKS. This is a shareable database built into the application. So as a fan finds something new and interesting for Star Trek they just add it to the database and on a monthly basis I intend to push out an update with everyone's contributions. The beauty of this spreadsheet is that updated compiles easily restore your existing personal database which is automatically saved and stored separately every time you close the application.

0,"I haven't watched a lot of TOS before this, but after the latest Discovery episode I went out of my way to watch City on the Edge of Forever.  After I finished watching it, it just struck me that it's great that new Trek content is making me go back and watch older Trek that I haven't seen before.  I'm sort of more tempted to watch the whole series now too.

I quite liked the episode and given how long these episodes are.. and the setting, it felt more like an old movie.  For a fully honest review, I'd have to say that the setup in the first 5 or so minutes of the episode felt a bit clunky..  but a mad Mccoy running around terrorizing the locals made up for it.

Kirk's dilemma was fun to watch unfold, Spock had a lot of great lines, and the whole plot of the episode was well put together, but I found the machine Spock built just showing them exactly what they needed to see a bit convenient..  although I admit I might have missed something in the dialogue.

The ending was great, with Kirk not even responding to the Guardian and after a brief pause just saying: ""Let's get the hell out of here"", and then they just leave.   Oh yeah, and Edith Keeler was a hottie, I would have had a big dilemma on my hands in Kirk's situation too

0,"Disclaimer: if you like this episode great! I respect that completely. I didn’t and want to vent. 

I just finished it and I don’t think an episode has irritated me this much in a while. This has to be one of the stupidest Trek episodes ever- everyone just has the idiot ball throughout (except Seven, Tuvok, and Torres). Janeway really put the life of her digital boyfriend over the lives of the Doctor, Kim, and Paris instead of shutting down the damn program! And then the episode has the audacity to make that BS sympathetic? 

Can we talk about the unfortunate implications in this and the first Fair Haven ep? Janeway got rid of Micheal’s digital wife, destroyed all memory of her, AND fully reprogrammed him because she viewed him as fictional and not real (like most holodeck characters). Then in this ep she’s treating him and the other FH characters as more important than her crew despite them being able to be fixed (like Paris did between episodes). Also the fact any holodeck character can be taken out of the program via the holo emitter (which really should only work for the Doctor) and given sentience through a malfunction (at least in TNG when Moriarity became sentient there was a better described reason). 

The entire thing not only seems stupid, but is really uncomfortable the more you think about it (especially in the light of what other flesh characters have done to holodeck characters in this franchise- you’re telling me they were ALL capable of sentience with the right computer problems?). I mean even just between these two VOY eps it’s frightening because Janeway killed the dude’s wife and wiped everyone’s memories- wasn’t she sentient too then? 

The Doctor is supposed to be a special case and I love that, but these episodes cheapen the concept and don’t even do it right due to contradictions.

0,"When I learned that the Romulan ""prophecy"" in PIC was that there were sentient machines bent on removing biological life, I assumed that there was a twist incoming, where they could reason with the machines or otherwise negotiate with them. It would be a nice Trek-y story to find some way of working to communicate with and understand these mechanical life forms so far removed from ourselves.

Instead, the Romulan xenophobia was essentially justified, because there were evil robots willing to exterminate biological life. What's the point of having a story where the moral is ""yes the bad guys were justified in their crusade against artificial life, but it doesn't matter because we stopped the apocalypse in the nick of time""? Why not have a story where the Romulans jumped to conclusions and unnecessarily deployed violence against innocents, when instead a good-faith attempt at communication would have worked?

I think the reason this especially annoyed me was that following DIS season 2, which gave us two seasons in a row with a senient AI enemy, both of which were both pretty cliche, and Star Trek had already perfected with its Borg stories.",The weirdest choice Star Trek: Picard made was having the evil Romulan cult be essentially correct about everything.,when i learned that the romulan  prophecy  in pic was that there were sentient machines bent on removing biological life  i assumed that there was a twist incoming  where they could reason with the machines or otherwise negotiate with them  it would be a nice trek y story to find some way of working to communicate with and understand these mechanical life forms so far  from ourselves instead  the romulan xenophobia was essentially justified  because there were evil robots willing to exterminate biological life  what s the point of having a story where the moral is  yes the bad guys were justified in their crusade against artificial life  but it doesn t matter because we stopped the apocalypse in the nick of time   why not have a story where the romulans jumped to conclusions and unnecessarily deployed violence against innocents  when instead a good faith attempt at communication would have worked i think the reason this especially annoyed me was that following dis season 2  which gave us two seasons in a row with a senient ai enemy  both of which were both pretty cliche  and star trek had already perfected with its borg stories the weirdest choice star trek  picard made was having the evil romulan cult be essentially correct about everything

All that aside, how do you think they could pull it off storywise?

My approach would be to essentially make the Tkon Empire = the Galactic Empire. 

Because they are both 'the Empire,' and they both existed a 'long time ago.' Also, Trek canon states the Tkon used planets as outposts and could move them through space — sounds like a Death Star / Starkiller Base to me.

Like Star Trek IV for example.  After they time travel back from earth with humpback whales, they created a new timeline where earth survives the probe and humpback whales are no longer extinct.

Star Trek First Contact creates a universe where the Borg took the place of Vulcans at First Contact and had assimilated Earth.

TBH TNG was probably the weakest (strongest characters though) but I am not writing this to list my preferences. My biggest problems with each series though are:

TNG: Lack of over arching story arch

DS9: The religious subplot didn't interest me

Voyager: The first season or two should have definitely dealt with the conflict between the two crews.

One thing i have noticed since watching Discovery is the difference in pace and loudness. The starships/stations of TNG, DS9 and Voyager are so quiet and peaceful. The glimpses of space out the window were, at first, quite claustrophobic but the darkness and the humming of the spaceship fills me with such a sense of tranquility.

0,"I grew up on TNG (and the rest of star trek too) and I love Patrick Stewart and I cannot for the life of me enjoy this show. It's mediocre television at best and absolutely terrible as Star Trek.

For example there was a scene where Picard was repulsed by the former borg on the artifact because of his assimilation PTSD. But after seeing how Hugh was helping them reclaim their lives it helped him work through some things and see the former borg as victims like him instead of monsters. Overcoming prejudice in space is a classic pillar of Star Trek and I was glad to see this in here. Unfortunately, it was a 20 second throwaway scene and the former borg are never shows as anything but mindless zombies for the rest of the season. That scene could have been expanded to an entire episode of TNG and it probably would have been one of the best if it were.

Then we have 7 of 9 grappling with the idea of taking over all the drones on the artifact to fight the Romulans and ultimately save all their lives. Ends vs. means in space, another pillar of good star trek. But again this idea is explored for about 10 seconds and then discarded and never really returned to. It's a convenient bit of deus ex machina disguised as a theme.

There were a lot of little scenes too which bothered me in a Star Trek context. It just did not depict a future I could be hopeful for and that's probably the most important characteristic of Star Trek

And for my last example of why it's bad star trek, there is the part where one of the androids does a mind meld with Agnes to try and clarify what her vision meant. Maybe they were wrong about the message? Maybe the advanced synthetics are peaceful and it was the fear of the unknown that caused the Romulans to think they are destroyers. Nope. Same message, just stated more clearly this time. This could have been the most star trek part of the series if it was done differently.

And even if it was the same story in a different, not star trek, show it still wasn't great. The main plot was a bad Mass Effect rip off and the ship was extremely boring (I don't even remember its name and I finished the show last night!). I liked some of the characters (Rios and his holograms for example)  but others were pretty bad. The guy with the sword for example. You could remove all his lines and replace him with a dog and it would not change a thing about the rest of the show. Another bit of deus ex machina disguised as a character this time. Hugh was well done but under used. There could have been some really interesting plotlines about him exploring what it means to survive being assimilated.

There was so little to like about this show and it has Patrick fucking Stewart in it. I don't understand it.",[MASSIVE SPOILERS] I don't understand how Star Trek Picard was this bad,i grew up on tng  and the rest of star trek too  and i love patrick stewart and i cannot for the life of me enjoy this show  it s mediocre television at best and absolutely terrible as star trek for example there was a scene where picard was repulsed by the former borg on the artifact because of his assimilation ptsd  but after seeing how hugh was helping them reclaim their lives it helped him work through some things and see the former borg as victims like him instead of monsters  overcoming prejudice in space is a classic pillar of star trek and i was glad to see this in here  unfortunately  it was a 20 second throwaway scene and the former borg are never shows as anything but mindless zombies for the rest of the season  that scene could have been expanded to an entire episode of tng and it probably would have been one of the best if it were then we have 7 of 9 grappling with the idea of taking over all the drones on the artifact to fight the romulans and ultimately save all their lives  ends vs  means in space  another pillar of good star trek  but again this idea is explored for about 10 seconds and then discarded and never really returned to  it s a convenient bit of deus ex machina disguised as a theme there were a lot of little scenes too which bothered me in a star trek context  it just did not depict a future i could be hopeful for and that s probably the most important characteristic of star trekand for my last example of why it s bad star trek  there is the part where one of the androids does a mind meld with agnes to try and clarify what her vision meant  maybe they were wrong about the message  maybe the advanced synthetics are peaceful and it was the fear of the unknown that caused the romulans to think they are destroyers  nope  same message  just stated more clearly this time  this could have been the most star trek part of the series if it was done differently and even if it was the same story in a different  not star trek  show it still wasn t great  the main plot was a bad mass effect rip off and the ship was extremely boring  i don t even remember its name and i finished the show last night    i liked some of the characters  rios and his holograms for example   but others were pretty bad  the guy with the sword for example  you could remove all his lines and replace him with a dog and it would not change a thing about the rest of the show  another bit of deus ex machina disguised as a character this time  hugh was well done but under used  there could have been some really interesting plotlines about him exploring what it means to survive being assimilated there was so little to like about this show and it has patrick fucking stewart in it  i don t understand it  massive spoilers  i don t understand how star trek picard was this bad

0,"Hi all....

First up and out the gate I'm a TNG guy. The pilot episode of TNG is the first memory I have of watching TV with my Dad. I was hooked. Movies, TOS, DS9, VOY and ENT. I've watched em all time and again. I've bought models. Learned some Klingon. I'm a Trekkie

The Kelvin movies for me are like some kinda grotesque sideshow. It's almost as if the events depicted are being remade as a holonovel and we're watching the result. Too flashy, too gaudy, and none of it makes sense. It exists and it's a giant cartoon but it's not for me.

Imagine my excitement at learning a contemporary big budget Star Trek series was in the works. Man I couldn't wait. I had this feeling that Trek could rival the MCU or Game of Thrones in terms of marketability and outright mania. The diversity of stories and adventures available within the Trek universe is STAGGERING. Then I heard Bryan Fuller was on board. Wow. An actual genuine TV talent. Someone who understands budget, visual and story telling appeal.... Nicolas Myer?! Holy shit. Then word of an anthology series.... Different crew, different setting each season! Yeeesssssss! Hook it to my veins!


Then Fuller left. Then Alex Kurtzman came aboard.... Ok ok.... It could still be good, right? Then, news that the anthology idea had been jettisoned, this would be a prequel. Oh no. Oh lord no. I had zero faith in Kurtzman respecting canon. I was right. 

I watch Discovery. I will continue to watch Discovery. But I'm not a fan. I watch because it's Trek. But in so many ways it let's itself down. And I'm getting tired of coming onto Trek forums and looking to engage in a reasonable discussion about Discovery without it's defenders acting like spoiled children or explaining plot holes using their own head canon. 

We're fans. We've invested hundreds of hours in this franchise, it's universe and it's characters. We're allowed be miffed when somone produces a serious that is totally disrespectful of that franchise. 

I know people harp on about this - but yes, Michael's crying. It's absolutely ridiculous. For comparison; imagine LaForge shedding a tear when dressed down by Picard. Or Bones. Or Odo weeping because Sisko said he didn't trust him. Remember DS9? Remember how all the characters felt like they cared and loved one another without saying it in every episode? Or hugging? Starfleet is a para-military organisation. These people are soldiers and explorers. They know how to comport themselves in front of their superiors. 

Her continued insubordination and her crew's tolerance of same is ludicrous. 
The mycilical network is farcical. Roller-coaster turbo lifts. The set design of Discovery is lazy as fuck man. Glowing corridors. Awesome. The Mirror Universe is a cheap, played out concept. Enough. Give us something new man!!! We're in the 31st century now man!!! New races... New empires... New Tech.... Give me new ideas, new worlds, new species, new sci-fiction spins, show me a Q joining Star Fleet, let's see what lies outside the Milky Way... Let's deal with Black Holes... Strange new phenomena.... I don't wanna see fucking Tilly with a new hair do acting evulz. 

I could go on and on ranting about my feelings on Discovery. But largely I feel disappointed. Let down.... They had a PERFECT opportunity here to move forward, a post Nemisis and post Kelvin incursion timeline. 25th century. New ship. New crew. And they wasted it. So now we have Picard instead.... 
Best not get me started there! 

Look - in short; I love Trek. Even when I hate it. I'm glad there's Trek on TV. But Discovery is SUCH a wasted opportunity..... It could have been so amazing. But instead I guess I'll tune it to hear about how Micheal Burnham is the only person capable of saving the Universe for the 33rd time in a row, then watch her cry for a bit.

So they should have gone back in time and stopped the burn.  To not do so when they can is a crime.  Even if doing so breaks some ridiculous rules.

Amazon also has the EU region free box - it was $146 for a hot minute but then $196, probably a cheap copy sold. Joy.

Ebay's cheapest is $160, so okay, time to look at imports. Ebay US doesn't have anything much cheaper, nor does Amazon US, but wow Amazon UK has it new for £57 and used for £44?? That comes out to like $105 and $90-- oh, can't ship to Canada, and it only told me when I tried to check out. Again sad...

0,"I always enjoyed Star Trek series' since I was a kid continuing through today.  Some years ago, I realized that Star Trek is sci-fi as a convenient fall-back idea for a series, but it was really a show about a group of people who are faced with unusually difficult, never-before-seen ethical dilemmas, and how  the group and each individual is able to go against their animalistic instincts and choose a better course of action with individual moral restraint.  I like this a lot about Star Trek.  


A person or society as a whole can stereotype a lot of things about Trekkies...but, on the whole, I don't think ""bad"", ""dangerous"", or ""evil"", nor any similar such negative adjective, could ever really be believed by anyone.  Nobody is scared of Star Trek fans.  They're usually pretty ok or even really good people - even if they aren't rich or powerful enough to actually be considered ""eccentric"" and are just considered ""weird"".  I like that about Star Trek a lot again.  


Enterprise never held my attention, though I honestly haven't ever tried hard yet.  Discovery, Idk... I heard it basically ruins canon and has some issues and has this alternate timeline thing...I'm not sure the details, but it ""breaks the rules"", I hear....  And I *did* see the JJ Abrams movie - the first of the three.  It wasn't a bad movie... I liked it like I liked the Star Wars one.... it was indeed in a ""Star Trek""-ish-in-appearance setting, but I didn't like it because it didn't feel like Star Trek and seemed more concerned with dramatic action and adventure than holding the crew and captain to high moral standards through extremely challenging trials and ethical decisions and dilemmas....   


And then I just started Picard.  I like Picard. I didn't realize it was a real Star Trek, as someone else described it to me as more of a sitcom in the Star Trek universe.  In my opinion, though, it's the first legitimate SEQUEL series to the TNG, DS9, VOY era series... and is official.. and very good.  **I thought it was ironic that the first episode was about Picard getting questioned why he left Starfleet, and he discusses later the moral issue of the Federation/Starfleet turning on their promises to protect Romulans - which leads to a massacre of Romulans - which leads him to reply, ""I left because IT WAS NO LONGER STARFLEET!""**  


I feel like he is, at this point in space-time, making a cool one-off series that fades away, **OR**, he is the beginning of the community of Trekkies and Star Trek people as a whole who decide to forbid this new Hollywood-esque, hollow Star Trek stuff, and bring Star Trek series' and films back to what they do best and the way they are naturally supposed to be.....   


Should the DS9 guys do a Star Trek: Sisko to complement, along side?  They could even make both of them interact, but specifically exclude the new amoral actiony Star Trek malignant ideas, which we really ought to reclassify as ""fan fiction"" someday, but I degress.

0,"I was just booted from a Facebook group for reporting a post that calls for Autistic fans to form a mob and take off Shatner's head.   


From what I have gathered, Shatner's sin is supporting the wrong Austism charity, because they want to cure a condition that most Level 1 Autistics do not see as a disease. I get that. I support neurodiversity in every form. But why do we condescend to that selfish attitude? There are two other levels of Autism, and those tend to be the marriage-wreckers, the bankruptcies, and the lifetime of suffering.   


I have two mothers in my family/professional life with Level 3 Autistic sons. If you have never lived with a person in this condition, it's a lifetime of diapers, home supervision, and often outbursts of madness and violence. My client came to a meeting with stitches on her face from her L3A adult son throwing furniture when he couldn't find his blanket. There are many people living with Autism and people in the Autism community who do not have the freedom of a Level 1 patient--the kind of a person with a job and plenty fo time to talk about Star Trek. Shatner's cardinal sin seems to be that, even as a 90ish year old man, he still works to raise money for families like these.  


Moreover, Shatner is not a Nazi, a fascist, a racist, or even a Republican. He's a liberal Canadian Jew and an old man who doesn't want to be bullied with the latest fashion progressive language. If you ask Mark A. Altman, author of THE FIFTY YEAR MISSION, he'll share with you detailed stories of his generosity, charity, and 100% non-bigoted non-Nazi political skepticism. In short, WS is a skeptical old man - not an activist.  


Can someone further unpack the Autism angle? Are there missing facts? The call for mob violence this morning was my breaking point. I could care less about being booted from a group with 40 comments calling Shatner a Nazi, but it's reached the point where Star Trek fans need to stop condescending to the large community of L31s in Trek.

___

**Episode 38 - ""Terra Firma, Part 1""**

* Kovich's inside-out holographic reconstruction of Georgiou may be the same technology developed by the EMH in ""Latent Image.""
* The hologram of Yor is wearing a Starfleet uniform most closely associated with TNG's first two seasons, placing it between the 2350s and mid 2360s. Yor is described as a lieutenant commander but his uniform collar is missing a rank.
* Yor is of the same species as Traitt in ""That Hope is You."" Initially identified as a Yridian, it was noted in The Ready Room that the species is intended to be Betelgeusian, though this has not been established in canon.
* Kovich explains that temporal travel can ""make you pretty sick."" In ""Relativity"" it was established that repeated time jumps could result in temporal psychosis.
* It is also explained that ""molecules"" don't like jumping around between time or dimension. In ""Parallels"" Worf's timeline-jumping was confirmed by examining his quantum signature.
* Yor's origins are described as an alternate universe created by ""the temporal incursion of a Romulan mining ship."" This is a reference to the establishment of what we refer to as the Kelvin Timeline, the setting of the most recent ""Abrams trilogy"" beginning with *Star Trek 2009.* The mining ship belonged to Nero, who went back in time after seeing the destruction of Romulus in 2379. This is the first on-screen acknowledgement of the Kelvin Timeline within the Prime Timeline, and its description as an ""alternate universe"" perhaps establishes it is somewhat different than a typical alternate *timeline* created by normal time-travel shenanigans.
* Kovich claims Yor was heretofore the only person known to have jumped across both time and dimension; this also describes Nero, his crew, and Spock, as they jumped from PT 2379 to KT 2233/2258. It seems Kovich knows the Kelvin Timeline exists but nothing more than that.
* Yor died because the Temporal Accords prevented the Federation from sending him home. This rigidity to rules and regulations at the cost of an individual's life doesn't sound anything at all like the Federation we know and love, but does sound exactly like the Federation that allowed Thad Riker to needlessly die, as related in ""Nepenthe.""
* Culber calls up a medical analysis which displays in front of him. The text is otherwise unremarkable, but refers to Georgiou's condition using the phrase ""universal constant,"" which evokes the time travel rules not of Star Trek but of Lost.
* Dannus V is a new location, but it is close to the Gamma Quadrant; I believe this is the first mention of that region in the series.
* Worf's calisthenics program may be a descendant of the *Discovery's* gymnasium, which appears to include, um, bladed weapons.
* Burnham gives Georgiou a Fitbit, a technology introduced in ""Consumer Electronics Expo 2013.""
* Hiraga Gennai was an Edo-era scientist known for...*looks him up*...the essay ""On Farting.""
* Carl reads the latest edition of *The Star Dispatch.* The newspaper (which used to be a common fictional paper throughout Hollywood) was previously seen in the projected alternate timeline where Edith Keeler survived in ""The City on the Edge of Forever.""
* On the back of the paper is a review of the soup at the Twenty-First Street Mission, which was the kitchen run by Edith Keeler. The accompanying picture is a stock photo of a real-life Depression bread line and I don't think it maps to Trek.
* Below the review is a stylized quote: ""Let Me Help!"" Keeler offered this sentiment to James Kirk, who countered that in the future those words would be cherished even above ""I love you.""
* Given all these extremely subtle freeze-frame references, it is worth observing that ""Edge of Forever"" involved the crew finding a deserted planet hosting a portal, with a Guardian, that allowed you to step back in time.
* A smaller headline on the front page of the paper reads ""Supernova Threatens Tkon Empire."" The Tkon Empire was featured in ""The Last Outpost"" and were an advanced society living 600,000 years ago until a supernova destroyed their homeworld. The only identified remnant of the Tkon was in the form of an outpost guardian called The Portal, asleep on a deserted planet. On a completely unrelated note, Spock estimated the Guardian of Forever to be approximately one million years old.
* Another reads ""Starship USS Jenolan Reported to Be Missing."" The *Jenolan* was en route to Norpin Colony in 2294 when it crashed into a Dyson sphere. There were 1.467 survivors.
* The back page of the paper also features some ancient Vulcan script, accompanied by a simplified IDIC symbol, crudely-drawn as though it were a rune.
* There is a crossword puzzle on the back page, but it is composed of hexagons, not squares. I don't know what this could indicate, and the pattern of the grid isn't familiar.
* The price of the paper is 15 quatloos, the initial wager that Kirk was untrainable in ""The Gamesters of Triskelion.""
* Besides all that, Georgiou's apparent time-travel journey is also reminiscent of the Orb of Time in ""Wrongs Darker than Death or Night.""
* Epsilon Indi, in the Prime universe, was an area of dispute for the Triacus Marauders in ""And the Children Shall Lead.""
* Kepler-174d is the name of a potentially habitable exoplanet discovered in 2014. I believe this may be the first mention of a real-life exoplanet, although there are several stars featured in Trek that have been found to host exoplanets after the fact.
* Mirror Stamets refers to Georgiou as ""Daughter of Rome,"" explicit evidence that the Terran Empire may be a direct successor to what we think of as long-dead power.","Canon References - ""Terra

The location of that Nebula came out of the Discovery computer after using all the input. 

The computer sends them to this specific far-away planet to cure Georgiou, where they can't easily communicate with Starfleet. The info about the distress signal is only revealed when they are away from Starfleet.

The computer creates a Kelpian starfleet captain to impress Saru.

The Kelpian woman is dressed in white, just like the Zora hologram in Calypso.

All in all, the Sphere data AI has unfinished business in that nebula which has nothing to do with the Burn.

Any thoughts?

0,"So, as I have posted before, I am watching a straight run-through of Voyager for the first time. I made it into Season 7 yesterday and am watching the episode Imperfections. So, Seven asked B'Elanna if she believes in an after life and B'Elanna responds, ""I hope so""!?!?!? Wasn't there a waste of time episode where you experienced a near death event and went aboard the Klingon Death Ship of Dishonor to save your mother? And you say you hope so! Out of everyone on Voyager you should know best B'Elanna Torres! Good thing Seven didn't ask Neelix, with the whole Big Tree in the afterlife episode. We weren't given a clear explanation to that. Does he believe in an afterlife or is he all smiles on the outside, but a cold lifeless hulk on the inside?

Also, I have noticed this previously, but haven't mentioned this on Reddit yet. Who is keeping the pacing for the show? They go from time critical to we need 5 minutes of dialog, when they should've been blown away by then. Captain the shields are at 52%, Bam, 26%, Bam, Captain shields are down, Bam, all of crewman Schlekis belongings are lost in space again Captain and we can't take another hit. Beam me over Captain, it's the only way you will make it through. Are you sure xxxxxxx, we were just getting to know you and what will we do without your cooking? I am sure Captain and as far as the cooking goes, you have Neelix and the Replicators (Rim Shot). Okay, we will beam you over. Captain should I notify such-and-such that xxxxxxx is going to beam over? No, that's okay, I'm wearing my plot armor. See you in a bit, I will walk xxxxxxx to the transporters and were taking the long way. xxxxxxx do you need to pack before going over to the ship?

I enjoy the show, but some easy corrections should have been put into a lot of these episodes. That's why the Mandalorian and the Orville are so good.

0,"Is there a trend here?  

First we have Captain Cristobal Rios and the La Sirena, quickly followed by Seven and her ship, and now we Brooke and his ship.  Small, fast freighters with some defensive capabilities, with a flat asymmetrical design, that were meant to be multipurpose and all set for some adventure.

There is a fictional appeal of Han Soloists, the maverick captain with his small ship daring all the odds thrown against it.  I am not sure how it fits or still fits into Trek lore.  I don't know if there is some corporate pressure from the top to make shows more Star Warsy, or that more and more writers are internalizing Star Wars concepts and this is showing out unconsciously in their writing.   The maverick and his ship certainly goes beyond Star Wars, as we have seen from Whedon's Firefly, and the upcoming live action Cowboy Bebop.   Its almost a universal thing in space opera and a foundational trope.    With the Han Soloist you will see the accompaniment of a Wild West, like this region of space we see in Picard with the destitute Romulan colonists, with law and order held by Rangers.  In Discovery the Wild West has expanded virtually to everything else, except for well defended pockets of civilization.  

Does it contradict the internal realism of the lore?   In almost every space lore we should expect to see small craft piloted by a captain and a small crew.   Within the realistic confines of the Star Trek universe, we can expect such things to happen.  However, when relying on such devices, we take a risk with the show's special identity to avoid turning it to yet another space western.

0,In most star trek shows when the bridge crew beams down to some backwater planet accompanied by low ranking officers the low ranking officers usually end up getting killed.  Tos was famous for this.  With red shirts dropping like flies.  Lower decks is different in that when low ranking officers beam down they don't get killed as much.  Probably because they are main characters.  If they weren't they would likely be dead already.  Hell one of the senor officers has already been killed.  He was a jerk but at least he died a hero.  So I guess we won't be seeing the usual low ranking nameless officer get killed on away missions as much.  But is it really star trek if the red shirts or gold shirts for the tng era aren't dropping like flies.

0,"Until two years ago, I didn't know much about Star Trek. I had seen some of the Plinkett movie reviews and watched a portion of Star Trek IV around 2009 when I was 14. I was more of a Star Wars guy, albeit not a big fan.

But two years ago I started watching The Next Generation simply because I always found the show fascinating from the hilarious Plinkett reviews. And oh boy, was it easy to get into. I fell in love from episode one. Binged it through watching several episodes a day. Next I watched all the films. Then TOS. Then DS9. Then Voyager. Then Enterprise. Then the Kelvin movies. I even watched all the fan made episodes (New Voyages &amp; ST Continues)!

After all that, I can safely say that Star Trek has become my favorite franchise ever. Even though I'm only 25 and I just watched everything during the past 2 years, watching those old shows gives me a weird sense of nostalgia, it feels like I was there when the shows aired even though I wasn't. The stories of the shows and movies that spans several centuries is simply epic. The stories often give me a warm feeling since the vision of the future seems to positive, and most episodes end with a happy ending.

TOS is certainly my favorite show, and era. Many say it feels campy after over 50 years, but to me the series feels timeless, and still relevant today. I just love the 60's retro-futuristic atmosphere and the talents of Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley, Doohan, Takei, Koenig and Nichols are simply fantastic. I never grow tired watching them on screen. My favorite movies are Wrath of Khan and Voyage Home.

0,"I'm going to be controversial on this sub and say that TNG was good. Why then were the TNG movies so bad? They had more money, more time in between movies, the same writers, and the same cast, at least the first three do. Not only that but they had examples of what good Star Trek movies looked like with the TOS movies. 

So why then do they suck so bad? Even if you like one or two of them (I like First Contact) you probably agree that even the best one doesn't live up to the standard the same cast and crew set with the show. 

I think the problem is precisely that it's the same crew and writers behind the show. A big problem the TNG movies share is that they feel like expensive TV Movies, and it's because they were done by TV people. 

Maybe if Rick Berman had given it to someone new while he focused on his TV Shows, we would've gotten what we did when Harve Bennett took over after Rodenberry. Then again that would've given him more time to interfere in DS9 so maybe it was for the best...

That doesn't excuse everything, like having an awful attempted rape scene on Troi's wedding night followed by this exchange

0,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start by saying that I'm not a huge Trekkie. I've watched most of TOS, TNG and Voyager, some ENT and 1st season of Discovery.

So if this is a stupid question, it's due to me not being too deep in the lore in general.

OK, with that out of the way, I'll elaborate on my question a bit.

Many races get design changes over the different series.

Consider for instance the Tribbles episode from TOS. The crew only realizes that one character is a Klingon after Bones took his temperature. Yet in later series, Klingons look very different and it's hard to believe that anyone would mistake a Klingon for a human.

A similar point can be made about Romulans. In the Neutral Zone, some of the crew project their hatred onto Spock, because Romulans and Vulcans look more or less the same. In later Series however, the two species look very much distinct.

Thank you very much in advance!",How does canon cope with design changes of alien races?,hey guys  amp  x200b i ll start by saying that i m not a huge trekkie  i ve watched most of tos  tng and voyager  some ent and 1st season of discovery so if this is a stupid question  it s due to me not being too deep in the lore in general ok  with that out of the way  i ll elaborate on my question a bit many races get design changes over the different series consider for instance the tribbles episode from tos  the crew only realizes that one character is a klingon after bones took his temperature  yet in later series  klingons look very different and it s hard to believe that anyone would mistake a klingon for a human a similar point can be made about romulans  in the neutral zone  some of the crew project their hatred onto spock  because romulans and vulcans look more or less the same  in later series however  the two species look very much distinct i totally  get how much of this is due to budget and tos being a little trashy in general  but how does canon cope with it  are these things explained at all  and if yes  how so  amp  x200b thank you very much in advance how does canon cope with design changes of alien races

0,"I am a big proponent of watching the original series in production order as I feel it is the best way.  This means I always start with The Cage.  However if someone who had never seen the series before were to watch it like this wouldn't the pilot act as a spoiler for the only two-parter.  I am not just talking about the Vina reveal in the flashbacks I am talking about Pike's fate as well.  It seems to me that if you go in knowing the outcome of The Cage then what Mr. Spock is doing is clearly obvious.  There is no mystery to why Spock is kidnaping his old Captain and stealing the ship.  I am glad that CBS all access is now including The Cage amongst their steaming service, despite that it never aired (I just wish they would have a production order option for ToS), I just think that it might make this episode a little redundant.

The first part of The Menagerie has a lot of original material but the second is mostly just a clip show like we often saw in the 1980s and 90s.  It is almost like watching a commentary addition to the The Cage with Captain Kirk providing the voice over.

0,"After the Romulan shuttle carrying the senator was blown up (thanks to Garak), the Romulans investigated the explosion and concluded that the Dominion was responsible.  Given the evidence, as presented in the episode, this makes sense.

However, they really glossed over the fact that it should have been easy for the Romulans to figure out that the shuttle made a stop @ DS9.   This visit wasn't covered up from what I saw, so it should have been at least a part of the investigation.  But no Romulans ever even tried to contact DS9 to try to see what might have happened on the station.  They just declared the war and the rest is history.

The RecDec scene had alien crewmembers scattered all the way through the room, but that was pretty much the only time.

TOS had Spock, and only Spock, as the only non-human crew member (except for another Vulcan in the mirror universe.)  TMP had a forehead guy on the bridge, who didn't have much to do besides stand at his station.

TWOK brought in Saavik as a featured character.

TSFS moved Saavik over to the Grissom -- and Enterprise had a tall bald guy in the background of the Admiral Morrow scene (that guy could have been an import from Reliant).

TVH was a special case (no Enterprise for most of the movie), but there was the alien helmsman on Saratoga, and the alien comm officer at San Francisco HQ.

TFF had... nothing.  Except Spock.

TUC had that reptile guy on the Excelsior bridge, and the comic relief scene with Crewman Dax.

0,"I was not sure after first watching it if this would hold as my favourite episode of anything, but it did. However, I was not sure why, and over time after first watching it in 2013 (and a couple of rewatches since) and trying to work out why the result is so effective, and have come to the conclusion that, for me, there are just many different emotions and reactions involved.

I have thought about this episode for way too long and can find many different interpretations that are compatible with each other. The more I think about it the more I am amazed, as each of the points below are also extremely powerful on their own. It's as if intended to merge multiple themes into one (whereas usually the episodic format limits them to 1).

Here they are for those interested:

* contentness with the knowledge that Kamin eventually found peace in his relationships and managed to carry on with his memories of Enterprise in the back of his mind, and that he led a calm and enjoyable life as Kamin

This also relates to Picard's backstory (never had children etc.), which people like to highlight, but I personally take a more abstract interpretation from this as it is quite a nice concept that things will eventually resolve themselves. However, his lack of prior family probably helped enable this.

* overwhelm at the point where he woke from the state

He finally discovers that all of the panic he felt at the start was genuine and he isn't mad, that his memories of the Enterprise are real etc. and that he had to spend years fighting against people telling him otherwise: he was right all along.

Throughout the episode you are left waiting for some kind of explanation to what is happening, and the reveal is beautiful imo.

* realisation that he was the sole person to be chosen to carry forward their memory.

There was uncertainty and suspicion at the beginning as to whether the probe is dangerous (brain rapes Picard; he feels kidnapped at first; also, the government guy is suspect). But as it turns out, the beam, nor his forced experience, was never malicious in the first place, and further to this, it self-destructed after its mission was complete. Their memory does not live on anywhere else.

So, there was only one probe, with a one-time use. There is surely something special about being selected to experience these memories with Picard.

* despair at the loss of their civilization due to the nova; all the characters you met over the last 40 minutes/years are suddenly long gone, it exploded more than 1000 years ago.

You experience all of Kamin's happy memories and are provided with a gist of the overall joy of Kamin's life, but his family is gone in an instant (and the whole planet). Their deaths are also greatly exacerbated by the fact it would have occurred far back into the past.

So any hope the viewer might have had of Picard somehow touching-base with them (virtually or otherwise) is hopeless, and you realize that very rapidly, which is pretty damn heartbreaking.

* even more despair at the fact they weren't able to do anything about the nova, but in particular that they didn't even attempt it because they knew it was so hopeless

The government supposedly lied about the rocket's purpose, to keep people's hopes up. It was a white lie to keep people's happy. This would have been an immensely heavy decision in itself and you feel for the leaders (regardless of whether it was correct).

The self-reveal of his family saying 'remember us' towards the end makes this even more damming. There was nothing they could do.

* peace in the knowledge that they must have all died together, painlessly, and instantly, and they collectively knew it was coming.

In the self-reveal they were smiling and had accepted their fate. They could be seen to be making the most of their situation even with death in sight (which we recognise as an incredible achievement, so it follows that we are extremely impressed, but they just in an incredibly weak position, so this is also heartbreaking.

* realisation that the same thing might happen to our Solar System some day (or human extinction through some other means) so therefore we should be making the most of everything, and Kamin's main quote (to his daughter) is this exactly, For me, this whole theme (or the effect if unintentional) is so immensely powerful that it forces me reflect on my life, intense periods of good and bad events, etc!

And then the flute at the end! He is feeling sad knowing the civilization is in the past... but also happy to have experienced it as Kamin.... but also likely desperately missing Kamin's family - moreover, though, he is generally respecting their (and our?) civilization at the same time!

The above is all stating the obvious but it's just stunning! If the multi-layering was intentional, then it is also genius.

Because Georgiou simply becomes someone who say nasty things to other characters, instead to have an actual development.

0,"As anyone who's been watching the new season knows, the Discovery's redheaded, cyborg-implant wearing helmsman has been getting some more attention lately. I think that's a very good thing for a few reasons:

1. *Her personality is realistic.* I know people like her - confident, witty, good at what they do, but they don't want to admit when they need help...until they crack under pressure. 
2. *She has flaws, and learns from them*. I think the way she snapped at Stamets in the dinner party scene was well written and was like a lot of arguments in the real world, and by including a character who struggles with stress and what appears to be some PTSD, Star Trek is shining a light on issues that don't get talked about but affect a lot of people. Also, showing her recognize that she wasn't okay and going to talk to Culber about it really encourages people watching who may be struggling with their own mental health issues to get help if they need it.
3. Finally, on the flip side of that, *she's a really good pilot*. Her ""full manual control"" flying scene in ""The Sanctuary"" was pretty darn cool. I got big Star Wars vibes from that whole part of the episode (in the best way possible), as well as her cocky attitude afterwards - which was a fun contrast to the other characters we've seen on the show so far. The conversation between her and Ryn was nice, too - how she used her own experience with stress to relate to him and get him to help her (and having Grudge along for the ride made the scene even better).

Overall, Discovery NEEDS its side characters, and at least in my opinion, they're the best part of the season right now - I much prefer hearing about what the bridge crew are up to than another Burnham and Book episode. For this reason, underdeveloped characters like Detmer getting attention in episodes are really helping make this series more well-rounded. Nice job to Emily Coutts for bringing this character to life during the new season - here's hoping this pattern continues and the rest of Disco's bridge crew get their moment in the spotlight!

I'm a hardcore Star Trek fan and a huge A/V aficionado. Somehow I missed the news a few years ago that a 4K UltraHD HDR10 remaster was made. A disc version was never released, but at least the digital streaming version is currently available for purchase. It's GLORIOUS! Me and my OLED are very happy right now.

**Notable Thoughts**

* Early scene where Kirk emerges after Saavik fails the Kobayashi Maru test; the light behind Kirk is incredibly bright and wonderful.
* Early scene where Kirk and Spock are standing in the hallway after the Kobayashi Training; there's a giant glass globe-thing that has etchings on it -- a level of detail I've never seen before.
* Enterprise in space dock and leaving space dock: 'nuff said.
* Regula One exterior shots are really, really crisp.
* Mutara Nebula exterior scenes: there's extra brilliance in the color, and bright bursts of light (nebula lightning, both the Enterprise and Reliant's ship lights) all really pop.
* Spock messing around with the warp core reactor tore into my retina.
* Little details like computer terminal commands and wall inscriptions are now legible.
* Not A/V related but this is the Director's Cut which I hadn't seen since the old DVD days.

**Some Bummers**

* There are a few scenes where the camera misfocused and the 4k footage exposes the errors. For example, Kirk's facial reaction after drinking Romulan Ale with McCoy.
* Some of the computer graphics at the time, like the 3 Klingon Ships as well as the Genesis Project video, all look incredibly dated. Unlike the TOS Remastered project, the TWOK remaster didn't ""re-create"" computer graphics.
* Paramount hasn't remastered any of the other TOS movies. :(
* The movie is nearly 40 years old and about half the movie's cast has passed away. :(
* RIP Scotty's movie nephew. :(",PSA to AV enthusiasts: The Wrath of Khan Director's Cut is available in 4K UHD with HDR10 on iTunes and VUDU.

I think it works well in this episode because in general the episode is frantic and there are a lot of bodies in and out of scenes and because although the stakes are high its a fairly light-hearted episode. Which is why I think DS9 would be the perfect setting for something like this. With so many beings in and out of the rickety space dock all the time a crew from the future my might not be noticed at all (except of course by Quark.) And with so many filler episodes that have no *major* consequences I feel like there's room for a crew to pop in without being saviors of the Dominion War and changing the timeline too much.

I've been walking through my partner through Star Trek for the first time (I've seen a lot of it before, but my partner is very new to it). We've been seeing the good TOS episodes, which we like, and I imagine we'll watch the TOS movies soon.

However, once we finish Star Trek IV, I don't know if we should jump into TNG and watch Star VI when we watch Unification, or if we should see VI before we watch TNG.

VI before TNG obviously makes some sense because it's a direct sequel to the TOS movies and you won't know how it would end with the Klingons (seeing Worf spoils that). But then again, that's how everyone in the 1990s saw it.

0,"So we all know in the TNG episode Hide and Q (S01E10) Q gives Riker the power of the Q and by the end of the episode we are led to believe Riker renounces his powers and Q takes them away... But I submit it is possible Riker always kept the power and just hid it from that point on.

This explains many of the implausible rescues and missions the Enterprise will go on to have over the rest of their years as well as Riker's success with the ladies. 

Further near the end of Star Trek: Generations Riker flat out tells Picard that he (Riker) plans to live forever. A very unusual statement from a mortal Starfleet officer. Even Kirk knew he'd die one day.

Now I believe it is possible Riker is responsible for ""The Burn"" in Discovery. A jaded. angry Riker taking revenge on the Federation he feels caused the death of this son (from the events of the Nepenthe episode of Picard.) 

End of season bad guy will be Michael Burnham vs. Will Riker for the fate of the galaxy.

0,In the wild west they only had shootouts every now and then.  In star trek they have shootouts almost every episode.  Not to mention dangerous space anomalies that can rip a ship to shreds.  The only remotely safe areas are planets that either have ships guarding them or a planetary defense grid.  And even most of those places are really dangerous.  So space is a near constant war between many different hostile aliens.  It's total chaos.  If someone made a video showing all of the combat situations in star trek it would be a long video.  And if someone made a list of all the ways to die in space it would be a very long list.  So space is so dangerous that I'm surprised most people aren't like no I'm not going out there it's insane.  The people who do travel through space are either really stupid or really brave or both.  So space makes the wild west look peaceful.  Because it's so dangerous.

If Section 31 need to infiltrate some Planet that have some Teleport Protection like Discovery Episode 08. I have an Solution

- Sure the easiest way out would be to Land an cloaked Shuttle or Ship. Easy

- But if they would detect this?

- Well this kind of Teleport Protection was similar to an WLan or Radio Signal Scrambler, right? 

- What would ""PC Nerds"" do, if there are to many WLan interferences? Right. They switch back to LAN Cable. 

- So they shoot an Teleport capsule from the Ship or Capsule to the surface linked with an thick protected ""Teleportation LAN"" cable. Of course the Cable must resist or block these interferences. 

In sort: They got ""Teleport Lift"" with Cable solution. 

This can be used if there is no place to land the Shuttle or Ship, of course if they can penetrate the force fields

- This is some sort of Airborne Rangers in Star Trek OPS way. No need to look if there are atmosphere for Parachutes use. Also this goes way faster (No need to Sky Jump like in Kelvin Timeline)

- Send an independent Capsule down that ""create"" Tools for the mission from its Database, like Weapons (Inspiration took out from Games ""Where do the unwieldy Weapons go?"" solution) and stuff. They can Fail safe protect the access if it falls into enemy hands

0,"I mean this post as a rhetorical question concerning how the show continues to structure its season arcs- in season 2 there was a whole lot of postulation about who/what the red angel was, and ultimately it was Burnham. Plenty of people speculated it could have been Iconians, or some extra-dimensional beings, but given how closed the bubble of the plot is, of course it was going to be Burnham. 

Ultimately, the burn will either be caused by Discovery travelling through time or Burnham sending the time suit back into the wormhole to self-destruct. It's far too easy. All the theories concerning the Omega particle, Q, a super weapon, etc., they venture too far outside the bubble of of the plot and how the show rotates its narrative. Burnham is the centre of that narrative- if she isn't the cause of a problem, then she is the ultimate solution.

It ends up being both predictable and boring, and it's one of the inherent issues of presenting these large-scale mysteries in a show that largely revolves around one person. If the mystery of the plot doesn't personally concern the main character, it's easy for the audience to get disconnected from the plot or ask the question 'why should the main character get involved'? 

One show that did this well was Mr Robot, but for an entirely different reason and one that I won't discuss at length because I wouldn't want to spoil the show for those who hadn't seen it. Long story short, the main character, Elliot, does something that he believes is right after a lot of internal fighting about whether or not it was right to do (and that many people would initially believe is right), and after the thing happens he realises that there were many repercussions that were outside his control and that there were powers at play banking on his success. In Mr Robot, the plot is solely Elliot's story, how he affects his friends and family, and how he finds justice for the wrongs in his life. He's always playing catch-up and attempting to out-maneouvre those who would use his actions for their own gain.

Fortunately for Mr Robot, it never had a big mystery to solve, but rather a continuous slow burn (no pun intended) of Elliot fighting the interests of the other players. Unfortunately for Discovery, there doesn't seem to be much of a parallel in terms of drawn out plot or story outside of Burnham's centrality to the story. 

And I get that people will be mad at this post and react strongly. That's fine, there's a very wild and disturbing insanity on either side of the debate as to whether or not a person likes Discovery or if it's a 'good' show, but I encourage everyone to think of how disconnected the episodes have generally been outside of Burnham's screen time. For instance, what happened to the guy who sat at the same desk for 40 years? Why doesn't Admiral Vance retrofit all the other Starfleet ships with the spore drive (besides removing Discovery's pivotal nature to the plot)? Communication consistency within the show has made no sense, with ships/worlds either able to communicate through subspace or not. Why would a ship from the 23rd century have plant seeds from 'the whole galaxy' if the whole galaxy hadn't been explored then, and why would it be placed near a star? Why didn't Earth know about anything happening within their own solar system?

The reality of all these questions is that each story is just a way by which Discovery fixes things. After all, what better way to end the season after building up so much goodwill than to have everyone discover it was the time suit that caused the burn in the first place?

The producers and writers visit this sub. It's why they've dived into making SNW, because they think it'll satisfy some nostalgic craving for the 'good old days' of episodic stories. We don't want nostalgia; we want coherent, intelligent stories that don't continually hinge on the same person solving the problem. No more, no less.

TL;DR: Burnham caused the burn.",Is anyone going to be surprised by the cause of the burn?,i mean this post as a rhetorical question concerning how the show continues to structure its season arcs  in season 2 there was a whole lot of postulation about who what the red angel was  and ultimately it was burnham  plenty of people speculated it could have been iconians  or some extra dimensional beings  but given how closed the bubble of the plot is  of course it was going to be burnham  ultimately  the burn will either be caused by discovery travelling through time or burnham sending the time suit back into the wormhole to self destruct  it s far too easy  all the theories concerning the omega particle  q  a super weapon  etc   they venture too far outside the bubble of of the plot and how the show rotates its narrative  burnham is the centre of that narrative  if she isn t the cause of a problem  then she is the ultimate solution it ends up being both predictable and boring  and it s one of the inherent issues of presenting these large scale mysteries in a show that largely revolves around one person  if the mystery of the plot doesn t personally concern the main character  it s easy for the audience to get disconnected from the plot or ask the question  why should the main character get involved   one show that did this well was mr robot  but for an entirely different reason and one that i won t discuss at length because i wouldn t want to spoil the show for those who hadn t seen it  long story short  the main character  elliot  does something that he believes is right after a lot of internal fighting about whether or not it was right to do  and that many people would initially believe is right   and after the thing happens he realises that there were many repercussions that were outside his control and that there were powers at play banking on his success  in mr robot  the plot is solely elliot s story  how he affects his friends and family  and how he finds justice for the wrongs in his life  he s always playing catch up and attempting to out maneouvre those who would use his actions for their own gain fortunately for mr robot  it never had a big mystery to solve  but rather a continuous slow burn  no pun intended  of elliot fighting the interests of the other players  unfortunately for discovery  there doesn t seem to be much of a parallel in terms of drawn out plot or story outside of burnham s centrality to the story  and i get that people will be mad at this post and react strongly  that s fine  there s a very wild and disturbing insanity on either side of the debate as to whether or not a person likes discovery or if it s a  good  show  but i encourage everyone to think of how disconnected the episodes have generally been outside of burnham s screen time  for instance  what happened to the guy who sat at the same desk for 40 years  why doesn t admiral vance retrofit all the other starfleet ships with the spore drive  besides removing discovery s pivotal nature to the plot   communication consistency within the show has made no sense  with ships worlds either able to communicate through subspace or not  why would a ship from the 23rd century have plant seeds from  the whole galaxy  if the whole galaxy hadn t been explored then  and why would it be placed near a star  why didn t earth know about anything happening within their own solar system the reality of all these questions is that each story is just a way by which discovery fixes things  after all  what better way to end the season after building up so much goodwill than to have everyone discover it was the time suit that caused the burn in the first place the producers and writers visit this sub  it s why they ve dived into making snw  because they think it ll satisfy some nostalgic craving for the  good old days  of episodic stories  we don t want nostalgia  we want coherent  intelligent stories that don t continually hinge on the same person solving the problem  no more  no less tl dr  burnham caused the burn is anyone going to be surprised by the cause of the burn

0,"For me, the most exciting thing about Discovery Season 3 has been that we basically have a whole new universe to play with, one that could never be fully explored in just one show, so I thought I’d throw a couple ideas for spin-offs out there to see what you all think.

1. United Earth Defense Force - with Earth having become a somewhat isolationist entity post-burn, I’d love to see some of the conflicts they’ve been involved in, either before or after Discovery’s visit. Obviously a bit harder to do proper exploration, but the Sol System is a big place without warp drive.

2. Generation Ship - In episode 3.4, we learn that Adira reached Earth on a generation ship, and I think it would be cool to see some of that journey. Of course, seeing as Adira is being pretty well fleshed out on DSC proper, it might make sense to focus on the ship at a different time, or a different ship altogether. Either way, sub-light interstellar travel opens up a ton of opportunities, and I can imagine the series working kinda like BSG, where there’s an overall story and premise, but most episodes focus on various logistical issues that pop up on a centuries long journey.

3. The life of a Courier - This would definitely risk treading into the same territory as The Mandalorian, but it feels like the best way to really explore the post-burn galaxy - a lone mercenary or small crew looking for dilithium and checking out all kinds of planets and civilizations.

What are your thoughts? Do you like any of these ideas?

Mauk-to'Vor seems to be similiar to Seppuku, which was a form of sucide that would restore honor to their clan. 

Bajorn Religon = Christianity

Now this is my opinion, I have no idea if I'm right or wrong but heres my reasoning.

The Bajorians have Religous Texts that are like the Verses in the Bible

The Emissary is like Jesus Christ. He sacrifice himself to save everyone else. 

I'm not sure about what the Orbs would be considered as.

The conclusion shows a very affecting interview of Shatner with Steven Hawking, where Shatner is clearly moved by Hawking and by the realization that his work had an influence on such a great scientist.
More indication of the affect and influence Star Trek had on people is the large number of fan made films that have been produced.

Perhaps you want to watch *Picard* or *Star Trek: Discovery*, but you ""probably should check out some of the older stuff first"". Maybe you've always been curious about *Star Trek: The Next Generation* but ""that's a lot of episodes to get through...who has the time?"". Or you watched the series when you were younger, and want to go back to it, but you're wary of *those* really bad episodes along the way.

In any case, I have a guide to help you. Other people have delivered their verdicts on whether each episode is worth your time. I have gone a little further. So much of the *Next Gen* is golden - or at least a well-crafted silver - but I have reduced the 7 seasons down to what I consider to be the very best episodes. 

This list includes only **30** of the 178 episodes in the series.  If each episode is 45 minutes long, that means that you have less than 23 hours of *Next Gen* remaining. Even then, I've suggested a few that you could skip (but would be mad to do so). I've also \*\*\*highlighted\*\*\* what I believe are five of the very best episodes. If you only want to take a quick dip in the *Star Trek* pool, you can be in and out in under 4 hours.

There may be some gaps in your understanding (Where did that character go? How did that character come back?) but recaps are built into the dialogue of every TV series. This list is about getting you the best, most important bits.

**Season 1** \- 4 Episodes  
**Episode 1 &amp; 2 - Encounter at Farpoint** \- It certainly makes sense to start at the beginning, and these two episodes set you up with what the crew (and the ship) are all about. You'll also see the show at the bizarre end of its sci-fi spectrum, with the all-powerful entity known as Q. He is the most antagonising of antagonists, and he just loves to play god with *The Enterprise.*  
**Episode 26 - The Neutral Zone** \- aaaand then skip right to the end of Season 1. No, really. You want the abridged version? Here it is. There are many great moments in the first season (and some horrendous ones...) but it hasn't really made it's mark yet. The final episode is a step up though. You get a look at the Romulans, a species with espionage practically built into their DNA. You'll also get to see everyone on the crew at their best, and get a real taste of how the two main officers on the crew make such a great partnership.

**Season 2** \- 4 Episodes  
**Episode 8 - A Matter of Honor** \- now that you've seen a little Romulan, have a whole heap of Klingon, the drunken-pub-fight empire. Riker, the ship's second-in-command, is temporarily assigned to a Klingon ship for reasons, and he must embrace their violent and cut-throat lifestyle to survive. He does, and it's *really* fun to watch.  
**\*\*\*****Episode 9 - The Measure of a Man\*\*\*** \- this is my first favourite on this list. Why? Well, nothing happens. No phasers and fired, no one throws a punch, there is zero peril. *It is, on the other hand*, entirely captivating. You also get to really see one key element of the show: really good acting that elevates the source material. This episode is 'only' concerned with the question of whether or not Data, the ship's android, is alive or not. The court case that ensues is a delight.  
**\*\*\*** **Episode 16 - Q Who \*\*\*** \- oh man, this is the other reason I love *Sta*r *Trek*. The episode starts with the return of the reality-bending Q, who amuses himself at the crew's expense... before drawing back the astral curtain to reveal one of the (in my opinion) best villains/monsters in all science-fiction. If you don't know The Borg, well I don't want to spoil too much. Visually they are somewhere between goofy and creepy (as only TV monsters can be) but in terms of villainy they tick a lot of boxes. It's the air of inevitable doom that does it for me.  
**Episode 20 - The Emissary** \- *Next Generation* likes to occasionally attempt a romantic story, and it usually falls flat. Either the affair is sickeningly sweet, or one or more of the people involved comes across like a sex-pest. In this case, the romance is fun to watch. On one side, a human-raised Klingon officer desperately clinging to tradition, and on the other is a half-human, half-Klingon with a firm belief in being true to yourself. It's an *angry*\-passion, and it's delicious. The rest of the episode is also great. 

**Season 3** \- 6 Episodes  
**\*\*\*** **Episode 10 - The Defector \*\*\*** \-  *Next Gen* hits a confident stride in season 3, almost every episode is wonderful. This one is an absolute gem. Intergalactic politics, Romulan shenanigans, twist and turns, high-grade acting. All tremendous.   
**Episode 13 - Déjà Q** \- if you're not a fan of Q by now, skip this one. If like me, you enjoy his brand of megalomania, this is a truly fun time. This isn't about him causing a problem though; this time it's all about Q. His arrogance, his vulnerabilities and his total lack of empathy.   
**Episode 15 - Yesterday's Enterprise** \- if you've followed this guide up until now, there's a bit of continuity missing for this episode. A main character made a surprising (and underwhelming) exit in an earlier season, and wibbly wobbly time allows for a reappearance. Nonetheless, this is a superb story about trying to reset a broken timeline, only to cause more cracks to appear.  
**Episode 17 - Sins of the Father** \- I swear I've not put every Worf episode on this list, but some of the best political wrangling and tensest character moments take place in the Klingon-centric episodes. This one tells you more about the angry, war-driven, assassin-filled society than any previous instalment.  
**Episode 23 - Sarek** \- there's a lot of emotions in this one. You... have to see the episode to know why that's actually a very clever line... um... so anyway, at its core this is an episode about a brilliant, intelligent, widely respected person who refuses to accept his senility. It hits a lot of emotional points, and hits them hard. The acting is sensational too. The scenery is comprehensibly chewed.  
**\*\*\*** **Episode 26 - The Best of Both Worlds, Part I \*\*\*** \- *this* is how you end a series. Again, you might just watch this and the next episode and get the best image of *Next Gen*. I will say no more about it, other than to say...

**Season 4** \- 4 Episodes  
**\*\*\*** **Episode 1 - The Best of Both Worlds, Part II \*\*\*** **-** ...both these episodes rule.  
**Episode 7 - Reunion** \- If you're not a Klingon fan like myself, or you weren't that into the romance story in '*The Emissary*', then you could step past this. If you enjoy the angry love and Klingon politics, you'll want this episode. It's another episode aiming for your emotions, so be warned.  
**Episode 24 - The Mind's Eye** \- It's the *Machurian Candidate* in space. Brainwashing and murder. Fun fun fun.  
**Episode 26 - Redemption, Part I** \- Even if you're only watching the episodes on this list, you will by now see all the elements that make *Star Trek* great. Political intrigue and back-stabbing, complex alien cultures, fun twists-and-turns, acting greater than a sci-fi TV series ever needs. This two-parter has all those elements, woven together with great skill. *Next Generation* certainly knows...

**Season 5** \- 5 Episodes  
**Episode 1 - Redemption, Part II** \- ...how to get you hooked for the next season.  
**Episode 3 - Ensign Ro** \- Ro is a character that should have gone somewhere, but the actor wanted to go somewhere else. Nevertheless, this is a intriguing episode that proves that not everyone in Starfleet is a goody-two-shoes, and tackles the topic of 'refugee crisis' in a fascinating way that stays clear of heavy handed messages.  
**Episode 18 - Cause and Effect** \- Every sci-fi worth its salt has a time loop episode. This take on the concept is one of the best, because there isn't one person reliving each day in detail. Instead the *whole crew* feels the creeping panic of the most intense deja vu, but never fully remembers what is happening when things reset. Luckily, this crew is super smart.  
**Episode 23 - I, Borg** \- A single Borg drone is disconnected from the collective and held on the *Enterprise*. Rather than punting the thing into space (which Picard would happily do right from the start), the crew decides to experiment. All good stuff.  
**Episode 25 - The Inner Light** \- you *could* skip this episode. The only aspect of the *Enterprise* involved in this story is Picard. It's a standalone story. You *should* absolutely watch this episode, however, because it is a wonderfully emotional and captivating story. If you're off to watch *Picard* after this, *The Inner Light* will make the captain's life story so much more compelling.

**Season 6** \- 4 Episodes  
**Episode 10 - Chain of Command, Part I** \- imagine watching a show for six seasons, and then they changed the main character mid season. You'd find it hard to watch. Well, that's actually a deliberate point of this episode. The *Enterprise* is needed for a special mission, and a militaristic, regimented officer temporarily takes over the ship. And Picard? He and his officers go special ops for a brief spell...  
**Episode 11 - Chain of Command, Part II** …which leads into an episode that I will say nothing about, except that this one is very hard to watch, but in a very good way.  
**Episode 14 - Face of the Enemy** \- Troi, the ship's counsellor, has to pretend to be a Romulan. I've skipped a lot of Troi-centred episodes (and some were *very* easy to skip) but this one deserves your attention, and has some of the best political chicanery so far.  
**Episode 21 - Frame of Mind** \- an episode where nothing is what it seems, everything is a lie, where even the plot twists may/may not be make-believe. Just wonderful. 

**Season 7**  4 Episodes  
**Episode 11 - Parallels** \- huh... if your following this list, then you're watching two reality-bending episodes in a row. They are widely different concepts, with a focus on different crew members. Honestly, this entire episode is worth it for a brief Riker vs Riker moment at the very end.  
**Episode 12 - The Pegasus** \- so much of season 7 is actually quite mediocre, without a lot to add to the legacy of the series. This episode is a big diamond in the rough. Oodles of slow-burning tension, officers questioning right and wrong, lies and mysteries between friends and one of the cutest moments between Picard and Riker you'll ever see.  
**Episode 25 &amp; 26 - All Good Things…** \- Having taken the shorter road to the end, these last two episodes may not feel as significant. They certainly aren't the best episodes on this list. It's some of the biggest and boldest sci-fi you'll see, but it might also leave you a bit winded. What is important, at least to me, is that these two episodes demonstrate one of the rare times that a science fiction TV show goes out with grace. Some try for one last season and fall flat, others are shut down before they can even say 'conclusion'.  *Star Trek: The Next Generation* brings in Q to bookend the series, raises the stakes to the highest degree, before delivering a beautifully tender final scene that is just right.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**  
I watched most of *Star Trek: The Next Generation* when I was younger, and recently revisited the whole series and the movies before taking a run at *Picard*. Reflecting on all the episodes this way really reinforces how much of this show is just so much fun. The majority of episodes are full of interesting moral dilemmas, political mysteries, inspired science fiction and wonderful acting.

I did feel a bit guilty about some of the episodes culled. There's a two-part story where Spock shows up, removing those made me feel cruel. If you disagree with my choices, and think that other episodes should be on this list, well... isn't that just further proof of how great this series is? Let us know!

I would, of course, recommend you watch the whole thing, if you have time. Or at least, *most* of it. Maybe I'll do another list of the absolutely skippable episodes. You know, like the one with implied ghost-human intercourse... or the one where the writer's tried to make a statement about apartheid and ended up being weirdly sexist... or when a virus makes the crew lose all their inhibitions...

is temporarily assigned to a klingon ship for reasons  and he must embrace their violent and cut throat lifestyle to survive  he does  and it s  really  fun to watch               episode 9   the measure of a man            this is my first favourite on this list  why  well  nothing happens  no phasers and fired  no one throws a punch  there is zero peril   it is  on the other hand   entirely captivating  you also get to really see one key element of the show  really good acting that elevates the source material  this episode is  only  concerned with the question of whether or not data  the ship s android  is alive or not  the court case that ensues is a delight                episode 16   q who             oh man  this is the other reason i love  sta r  trek   the episode starts with the return of the reality bending q  who amuses himself at the crew s expense    before drawing back the astral curtain to reveal one of the  in my opinion  best villains monsters in all science fiction  if you don t know the borg  well i don t want to spoil too much  visually they are somewhere between goofy and creepy  as only tv monsters can be  but in terms of villainy they tick a lot of boxes  it s the air of inevitable doom that does it for me     episode 20   the emissary       next generation  likes to occasionally attempt a romantic story  and it usually falls flat  either the affair is sickeningly sweet  or one or more of the people involved comes across like a sex pest  in this case  the romance is fun to watch  on one side  a human raised klingon officer desperately clinging to tradition  and on the other is a half human  half klingon with a firm belief in being true to yourself  it s an  angry   passion  and it s delicious  the rest of the episode is also great    season 3      6 episodes               episode 10   the defector               next gen  hits a confident stride in season 3  almost every episode is wonderful  this one is an absolute gem  intergalactic politics  romulan shenanigans  twist and turns  high grade acting  all tremendous      episode 13   déjà q      if you re not a fan of q by now  skip this one  if like me  you enjoy his brand of megalomania  this is a truly fun time  this isn t about him causing a problem though  this time it s all about q  his arrogance  his vulnerabilities and his total lack of empathy      episode 15   yesterday s enterprise      if you ve followed this guide up until now  there s a bit of continuity missing for this episode  a main character made a surprising  and underwhelming  exit in an earlier season  and wibbly wobbly time allows for a reappearance  nonetheless  this is a superb story about trying to reset a broken timeline  only to cause more cracks to appear     episode 17   sins of the father      i swear i ve not put every worf episode on this list  but some of the best political wrangling and tensest character moments take place in the klingon centric episodes  this one tells you more about the angry  war driven  assassin filled society than any previous instalment     episode 23   sarek      there s a lot of emotions in this one  you    have to see the episode to know why that s actually a very clever line    um    so anyway  at its core this is an episode about a brilliant  intelligent  widely respected person who refuses to accept his senility  it hits a lot of emotional points  and hits them hard  the acting is sensational too  the scenery is comprehensibly chewed                episode 26   the best of both worlds  part i              this  is how you end a series  again  you might just watch this and the next episode and get the best image of  next gen   i will say no more about it  other than to say     season 4      4 episodes               episode 1   the best of both worlds  part ii                   both these episodes rule     episode 7   reunion      if you re not a klingon fan like myself  or you weren t that into the romance story in   the emissary    then you could step past this  if you enjoy the angry love and klingon politics  you ll want this episode  it s another episode aiming for your emotions  so be warned     episode 24   the mind s eye      it s the  machurian candidate  in space  brainwashing and murder  fun fun fun     episode 26   redemption  part i      even if you re only watching the episodes on this list  you will by now see all the elements that make  star trek  great  political intrigue and back stabbing  complex alien cultures  fun twists and turns  acting greater than a sci fi tv series ever needs  this two parter has all those elements  woven together with great skill   next generation  certainly knows     season 5      5 episodes    episode 1   redemption  part ii         how to get you hooked for the next season     episode 3   ensign ro      ro is a character that should have gone somewhere  but the actor wanted to go somewhere else  nevertheless  this is a intriguing episode that proves that not everyone in starfleet is a goody two shoes  and tackles the topic of  refugee crisis  in a fascinating way that stays clear of heavy handed messages     episode 18   cause and effect      every sci fi worth its salt has a time loop episode  this take on the concept is one of the best  because there isn t one person reliving each day in detail  instead the  whole crew  feels the creeping panic of the most intense deja vu  but never fully remembers what is happening when things reset  luckily  this crew is super smart     episode 23   i  borg      a single borg drone is disconnected from the collective and held on the  enterprise   rather than punting the thing into space  which picard would happily do right from the start   the crew decides to experiment  all good stuff     episode 25   the inner light      you  could  skip this episode  the only aspect of the  enterprise  involved in this story is picard  it s a standalone story  you  should  absolutely watch this episode  however  because it is a wonderfully emotional and captivating story  if you re off to watch  picard  after this   the inner light  will make the captain s life story so much more compelling   season 6      4 episodes    episode 10   chain of command  part i      imagine watching a show for six seasons  and then they changed the main character mid season  you d find it hard to watch  well  that s actually a deliberate point of this episode  the  enterprise  is needed for a special mission  and a militaristic  regimented officer temporarily takes over the ship  and picard  he and his officers go special ops for a brief spell       episode 11   chain of command  part ii    which leads into an episode that i will say nothing about  except that this one is very hard to watch  but in a very good way     episode 14   face of the enemy      troi  the ship s counsellor  has to pretend to be a romulan  i ve skipped a lot of troi centred episodes  and some were  very  easy to skip  but this one deserves your attention  and has some of the best political chicanery so far     episode 21   frame of mind      an episode where nothing is what it seems  everything is a lie  where even the plot twists may may not be make believe  just wonderful    season 7    4 episodes    episode 11   parallels      huh    if your following this list  then you re watching two reality bending episodes in a row  they are widely different concepts  with a focus on different crew members  honestly  this entire episode is worth it for a brief riker vs riker moment at the very end     episode 12   the pegasus      so much of season 7 is actually quite mediocre  without a lot to add to the legacy of the series  this episode is a big diamond in the rough  oodles of slow burning tension  officers questioning right and wrong  lies and mysteries between friends and one of the cutest moments between picard and riker you ll ever see     episode 25  amp  26   all good things       having taken the shorter road to the end  these last two episodes may not feel as significant  they certainly aren t the best episodes on this list  it s some of the biggest and boldest sci fi you ll see  but it might also leave you a bit winded  what is important  at least to me  is that these two episodes demonstrate one of the rare times that a science fiction tv show goes out with grace  some try for one last season and fall flat  others are shut down before they can even say  conclusion     star trek  the next generation  brings in q to bookend the series  raises the stakes to the highest degree  before delivering a beautifully tender final scene that is just right   final thoughts    i watched most of  star trek  the next generation  when i was younger  and recently revisited the whole series and the movies before taking a run at  picard   reflecting on all the episodes this way really reinforces how much of this show is just so much fun  the majority of episodes are full of interesting moral dilemmas  political mysteries  inspired science fiction and wonderful acting i did feel a bit guilty about some of the episodes culled  there s a two part story where spock shows up  removing those made me feel cruel  if you disagree with my choices  and think that other episodes should be on this list  well    isn t that just further proof of how great this series is  let us know i would  of course  recommend you watch the whole thing  if you have time  or at least   most  of it  maybe i ll do another list of the absolutely skippable episodes  you know  like the one with implied ghost human intercourse    or the one where the writer s tried to make a statement about apartheid and ended up being weirdly sexist    or when a virus makes the crew lose

0,"Before you get triggered, I am not a right winger, not that there is anything wrong with that, but I am not. I live in LA, I am liberal, more classic liberal, but not a conservative. I loved Star Trek for its diversity since the first episode of TNG. I was still a kid then and didn't understand many things. I understand many more things these days, but one thing I will never understand is forced equality,. I was born in USSR. I know what equality of opportunity is vs. equality of outcome. You can't force equality to appease people and that's what Discovery has done. I've suffered through this terrible series because I love Star Trek and now I am just catching up with seasons 3. I don't like watching 1 episode at a time so I am watching the first 8 (not sure how many were shot for Season 3). Besides the simple fact that there are no white males anywhere to be seen, besides the fact that all the positions of power are help by women, besides the horrible writing, this is NOT Star Trek. Don't get me this BS about previous ST was about diversity. I know what ST was, is, and is not, and this is not ST. It's garbage. Look at DS9 or Voyager. I never even thought about it because it was given that those places are going to be diverse. Discovery doesn't let me forget that white men are bad and don’t belong here. (Google Straight White Men Incompetent Discovery). You want to get triggered, call me names, or bring your sorry excuses for why I am wrong, totally fine, but I am right and I've realized how many people (men, women, etc.) all feel the same. This is NOT even close to being Star Trek. Funny enough, Orville is more ST than this sorry iteration of Star Trek. How dare they pervert Star Trek?

Enterprise: show the final days of the romulan war, and the birth of the federation

Tos: after TAS, finish the fifth year of this crews voyage, and have them return home

TMP/Tff: There's big time jumps for the movies, and there are unseen adventures following The motion picture, and in the gap before The undiscovered country. Definitely a possibility

TNG: Show us a prequel series for Picard, and his rise through the Starfleet ranks. 

DS9: None of the ds9 crew have been touched sine nemesis, so it's clear to me there's a plan for them. Even though certain cast members are now gone, animation would be an honourable way to carry on their Legacies

VOY: How does this crew settle back into alpha quadrant life? What happens to voyager when Janeway leaves? What breaks up chakotay and seven, and drives her away? Does Kim ever get a promotion!?

Kelvin timeline: the expensive cast was the reason this was cancelled, so new voice actors, and a slashed animated budget would solve both those problems, and provide a litmus test into whether this universe is worth keeping around

As this would be a set of anthology series, it sets these shows up and reinvigorates the characters for potential future use. There are stories here that don't warrant a full 7 year run, but could still deserve a 1 season continuation","Star Trek: Legacies, my pitch for a show",throughout the newer shows  star trek is toying with its legacy characters  half the tng crew show up in picard  seven and janeway are back  we ve got the titan  pikes leading a series etc   so why not have a  where are they now   sort of show  it would need to be animated  as these actors have all aged or passed on  or in some cases are too expensive  but imagine  10 13 episodes to do an x years later sequel series  you could do this with the following enterprise  show the final days of the romulan war  and the birth of the federationtos  after tas  finish the fifth year of this crews voyage  and have them return hometmp tff  there s big time jumps for the movies  and there are unseen adventures following the motion picture  and in the gap before the undiscovered country  definitely a possibilitytng  show us a prequel series for picard  and his rise through the starfleet ranks  ds9  none of the ds9 crew have been touched sine nemesis  so it s clear to me there s a plan for them  even though certain cast members are now gone  animation would be an honourable way to carry on their legaciesvoy  how does this crew settle back into alpha quadrant life  what happens to voyager when janeway leaves  what breaks up chakotay and seven  and drives her away  does kim ever get a promotion  kelvin timeline  the expensive cast was the reason this was cancelled  so new voice actors  and a slashed animated budget would solve both those problems  and provide a litmus test into whether this universe is worth keeping aroundas this would be a set of anthology series  it sets these shows up and reinvigorates the characters for potential future use  there are stories here that don t warrant a full 7 year run  but could still deserve a 1 season continuationstar trek  legacies  my pitch for a show

For those who don't know, Ming-Na is probably best known for voicing Mulan, but has also been a cast member on Stargate: Universe, Marvel's Agents of SHIELD,  and has recently been a badass recurring character on The Mandalorian. She's also been a voice across many fun cartoons and video games.

I think she needs the Star Trek, Stargate, Star Wars trifecta, and her cool authority is just begging for a Starfleet uniform. If they wanted a captain/lead for future show... just saying.

0,"Following the introduction of Adira Tal on Discovery, I have been discussing gender and Trills quite a bit lately with friends.  When referencing Trill symbionts, I always use they/them pronouns.  However, symbionts have historically been referred to in the singular as ""it"", both inside and outside of canon.  This seems inappropriate to me, as they are sentient beings that likely have some sense of gender identity either inherent or imprinted from previous hosts.  Even if that identity is non-binary or agender, I feel it should be acknowledged.

0,"I have been trying to watch TNG, so far I'm only 10 episodes into season one and it's a real drag.

So my question is this, could I skip to season 3, and then watch season 1 and 2 at the end as a sort of ""flashback"" like the machete order with star wars, without it really affecting the overall impact of the show, or is it really that important to trudge through the shit at the start?

0,"Between the political intrigue in the Romulan Empire and Picard becoming a full on badass this movie had it all. First off ditching the Prime Directive (which had always unnecessarily held back the Enterprise and it's crew) we get an actual proper survey mission planetside in an appropriate vehicle for the job (dune buggy of course) and when a group of hostiles in the Argo scene fire at them they do the right thing and actually fire back and don't take shit from some aggressive assholes. This followed by the introduction of Shinzon and the awesome Scimitar followed by Picard, always being a bit more diplomatic than aggressive try and talk some sense into the man. But instead we get a full half hour of combat that only some parts of DS9 might match, up to and including just full on ramming the EE in a move of desperation. And to top it off we get Picard finally just flat out impaling Shinzon with an iron rod and Data going out in a blaze of glory. This was not only a great way to end the TNG arc but by far the best ST movie in general. Perhaps some moments in Enterprise top it, but Enterprise unfortunately really wasn't Star Trek, it really was the extended sixth season of Quantum Leap, and a fairly decent way to end that show as well.","Baseless Arguments aside, Nemesis Was by far the best movie.",between the political intrigue in the romulan empire and picard becoming a full on badass this movie had it all  first off ditching the prime directive  which had always unnecessarily held back the enterprise and it s crew  we get an actual proper survey mission planetside in an appropriate vehicle for the job  dune buggy of course  and when a group of hostiles in the argo scene fire at them they do the right thing and actually fire back and don t take shit from some aggressive assholes  this followed by the introduction of shinzon and the awesome scimitar followed by picard  always being a bit more diplomatic than aggressive try and talk some sense into the man  but instead we get a full half hour of combat that only some parts of ds9 might match  up to and including just full on ramming the ee in a move of desperation  and to top it off we get picard finally just flat out impaling shinzon with an iron rod and data going out in a blaze of glory  this was not only a great way to end the tng arc but by far the best st movie in general  perhaps some moments in enterprise top it  but enterprise unfortunately really wasn t star trek  it really was the extended sixth season of quantum leap  and a fairly decent way to end that show as well baseless arguments aside  nemesis was by far the best movie

\- Nick Fury had half his face blown off by Kodos or something?  And has to wear a black mask over half it now?  ...In the time of Star Trek, they can't do better than doctors today can with a skin graft or whatever?  Bummer.

\- Roddenberry predicted so much of the future correctly... but the computer can't merge the two photos of Kodos or compare them for similar points?  Kirk has to rely on FEELINGS instead (surprise - it's a Kirk specialty!)

\- Lenore Karidian (Kodos' daughter) is supposed to be 19 years old. NINETEEN.  She's still barely a teenager, and she's 30-something-year-old Kirk's love interest for the episode.  Rewatching today (and not as a kid to whom everyone over 15 seemed ""old"") this just looks creepy.  ""You cared about her, didn't you?"" McCoy asks at the end.  ""Yes, doctor.  I knew her for five minutes but she had really dreamy eyes and a kicking figure.""

\- I still have no idea how to make sense of star dates.  I'm pretty sure they're just randomly-generated numbers.

\- Dr. McCoy is the worst friend ever (and probably not great at his job) when Mr. Spock comes looking for advice and all Bones can do is drink and suggest that Kirk has the hots for the 19-year-old.  ""If you won't join me, at least don't judge me... until you've tried it!""

\- ""All the power of this ship, surging and throbbing... Are you like that captain?""  Ugh.  Pretty porno for 1960s TV, wasn't that?

\- Kodos killed half of his people because he thought there weren't enough resources to go around?  ...So THIS is where Thanos got the idea.

\- Nichelle Nichols has a beautiful voice.  But that song went on for a looong time.

\- Don't drink the milk, Riley!  Someone sprayed it with an old plastic spray bottle full of Windex or something!  ...That spray bottle sure took me out of the moment.

\- If Anton Karidian WASN'T Kodos, he sure is a suspicious-seeming dick to Captain Kirk when he comes to question him.  Way to make yourself look innocent, pal.

\- It's really too bad that this is the last episode with Lt. Riley.  He was a good character, and I would've liked to see more of him.  I might even take him over Chekov.

0,"Star Trek’s speculated economy has piqued people’s interests for decades. One thing is certain: money does not exist in the Federation.

There are many ways justifications for this, but let’s end one right here. It is NOT a Post-Scarcity society. Yes, replicators exist in Star Trek, but they only existed in Next Generation and not in the original series. The original series only had protein synthesizers. So the moneyless society of the Federation existed before replicators were invented. Also, some things can’t be replicated: Dilithium, which is a power source for warp-drives, and (ugh) Latinum.

So the Federation’s economy gets along fine without money or endless resources. Additionally, we are shown that people on earth can seemingly own vast tracts of land, like Picard’s brother with his French vineyard.

Several economic systems can manage this:

1.	⁠an advanced version of the commons (I’m not an expert on this), where people can just pick up and own whatever they have. This may be the reason there are several colonies on other planets: lack of space on earth made them find new places to live. A single dude could own his own planet.

2.	⁠Cooperation and negotiation: there are many names for this, but essentially the distribution of resources is negotiated by individuals. It’s never shown, but perhaps Kirk, Picard and McCoy all debate on who gets what room at the Federation Hotel Kaiser-5, instead of it going to the person with the most money. I’d imagine it could get very bureaucratic, such as needing to write a letter to the city council if you want to get a 2-acre beet farm.",Star Trek’s economy isn’t that complicated or mysterious,star trek s speculated economy has piqued people s interests for decades  one thing is certain  money does not exist in the federation there are many ways justifications for this  but let s end one right here  it is not a post scarcity society  yes  replicators exist in star trek  but they only existed in next generation and not in the original series  the original series only had protein synthesizers  so the moneyless society of the federation existed before replicators were invented  also  some things can t be replicated  dilithium  which is a power source for warp drives  and  ugh  latinum so the federation s economy gets along fine without money or endless resources  additionally  we are shown that people on earth can seemingly own vast tracts of land  like picard s brother with his french vineyard several economic systems can manage this 1 	 an advanced version of the commons  i m not an expert on this   where people can just pick up and own whatever they have  this may be the reason there are several colonies on other planets  lack of space on earth made them find new places to live  a single dude could own his own planet 2 	 cooperation and negotiation  there are many names for this  but essentially the distribution of resources is negotiated by individuals  it s never shown  but perhaps kirk  picard and mccoy all debate on who gets what room at the federation hotel kaiser 5  instead of it going to the person with the most money  i d imagine it could get very bureaucratic  such as needing to write a letter to the city council if you want to get a 2 acre beet farm star trek s economy isn t that complicated or mysterious
0,"To be fair I think the producers of Discovery were very wise to dovetail in active links to STOS and to morph Discovery way into the future to avoid canon issues. We are about to watch Discovery Season 3 Episode 8. The show is 'enjoyable' and worthy of watching. But does it invoke the same sense of caring about the characters at ANY of the past ST series? I don't think so. I've tried to care about this woman that out of the blue is Spock's adopted sister that the entire series orbits about. Really I have... maybe too hard but I'm sincere.

My level of caring about any of the players in Discovery is LESS than it is for ANY of the new characters that, by season 3, I found myself relating to in ANY of the previous series. I'm watching it because it is 'Star Trek' but I'm not finding myself drawn in. At times I feel like I'm watching one of the 'Transformers' movies where the action is so non-stop your eyes sort of blur and you zone out.

Surely someone out there feels the same way. I'm not disrespecting the series. I'm just saying, from a buy-in standpoint, is the lessor of any that preceded it.

I have HIGH hopes for 'ST: Strange New Worlds'. Seeing Captain Pike walk onto the updated Enterprise was the most emotion I've felt across all three seasons.

and now I'm wishing they'd done some subplot about a cover-up of this fact. I tend to get annoyed with over-use of Section 31, but protecting the tactical advantage of being able to teleport at the cost of sacrificing everyone who teleports(since it DOES replace them with a perfect copy) seems like EXACTLY the kind of mission they'd have.

The best scifi teleporter I've ever seen, in regards to ""do you die or not from this?"" is Dark Matter(a fucking CRIME that that show got cancelled). The way that one works, is you go into a coma, and a perfect copy of you is created at your destination. That copy does whatever it is you need to do over there, and then gets back into the pod, where it is deconstructed(and yeah, the clone would be aware that it was gonna die when this was all over), and then the new memories it generated are written into your brain.

*''All I heard when I was little was how deceitful the Federation was. How they'd turn on you.* ***You want to scare an Andorian child, tell them they're going to a Federation Summer Camp***\*'\*'.    - Ryn

I believe the Federation really messed up on caring about the individual planet's (this almost happened once to Andoria in Memory Beta content) needs &amp; what RYn says is a result of that. Granted he was born into the Emerald Chain, and the Orions were always shown as antagonistic to the Federation; but a century can't drastically change the opinion molded for a Millenia unless something truly serious happened. (And how on \[insert planet\] did Andorians team up with the Orions)

The first 2 sentences that Ryn says make sense in the 32nd Century, said either due to influence by Orions or even by the Federation's actions (exploiting you for the needs of many may seem like turning on you). But children being scared doesn't happen through tales about deceitful, untrustworthy or uncaring entities, it happens through stories of an evil, scary or ''bad'' entities. This probably means the Federation went even crazier on Andoria than the Ni'varrans (as it is unlikely they were scared of it), making themselves see mlike the bad guy.

I was very unhappy with the situation in Season 2, especially when even after we got Culber back from the dead, it seemed like their relation was toast. It felt like a ""have your cake and eat it too"" situation where they were trying to have gay people and avoid any of that pesky being gay on screen.

FFwd to Season 3 and they're a happy couple again (seems sudden but, whatever, the less they drag it out the better), they act like a REAL couple and fight/kiss on screen, and while it's a bit weird for non-binary to even be a thing anyone is nervous about in the 3200s, it's nice that Stamets got to be the one having that talk and he was perfect in it.

0,"It's common knowledge of the tendency for Trek shows to have a rocky first season, a better but mixed second season, and then a good third season. And mostly smooth sailing from then. TNG is a prime example, but it also applies to Voyager, DS9 and Enterprise. The only ones exempt from this rule are TOS, which had only 3 seasons and seemed like a rollercoaster of quality up and down until a lesser S3, and TAS, which basically has 1 season, but it's split 16/6 across both seasons weirdly

Anyway, The term ""growing the beard"" is obviously a reference to how Riker grew a beard for Season 2 of TNG, which coincidently resulted in a better season for TNG. And I think Discovery has grown it's beard

The first season was mixed to say the least. I hold to my heart that Magic to make the sanest man go mad is one of the great time travel episodes in the franchise, and the characters are mostly all charming and likeable, but their journey is more of a slow walk through mud. We spend half of it in the mirror universe, part of it is all about Burnham's disobedience, and then the rest is sort of just filler between those two beats. And the Enterprise arrival at the end seems to be a begging to entice the show to be renewed (if it wasn't already BTS) just like the Best of Both Worlds before it. But instead of pulling this card after 3 seasons, they're pulling it right out of the gate? 

The second season is a major shift though, we get the show being embedded into the star trek universe, more familiar faces and places show up, and Pike literally kicks the crew into being... well... a crew. We get discussions of faith like New Eden, classical throwbacks like If Memory Serves, and a season wide mystery about the red angels. It still hangs onto some of the weaker elements of the first season, like Tyler and the Klingons, but the new stuff is more than enticing.

Then the third season had a lot to prove. Was this raise in quality a product of bringing in these legacy characters like Pike? Or better quality on the show? And it seems to be the latter. Now I thought the first episode was a disappointment. It seemed like it was the Zany Michael from the first season all over again, throw in a few action scenes, and that's it. But starting with the second episode, we get that Volta with the time jump, we see the emotional effects of their journey, we get resolution to story arcs 30 years in the making, they develop these characters further in both their weakness and their strengths, they have a mission, they have a mystery, and god damn you know they're gonna solve it. Every episode except the first has been a rollercoaster for me. And SARU man, finally he gets his long-overdue promotion and he is already surpassed numerous other main cast captains. Sure, it's his first days of captaincy, but he accepts the role in full swing, and is more than competent. He is not afraid to sanction his officers, but he's not going to ignore their personal lives like Picard either. He is driven by protecting and discovering, but he's not going to break every rule in the book to get to that point like a few captains we've known. 

It's clear now why the show is renewed for Season 4 and filming, and now we can get a better picture of why CBS want this baby to run the whole 7 seasons. If you want to move the franchise forward, it helps to have the show move forward in time, like literally all the other series apart from ENT before it, which arguably was such a step back in time, that Trek lost it's footing and fell over. Now in the future, they can write their own future without being bound by TOS edging closer and closer. And I hope to see this show ride on as it is now",Star Trek Discovery has finally grown it's beard,it s common knowledge of the tendency for trek shows to have a rocky first season  a better but mixed second season  and then a good third season  and mostly smooth sailing from then  tng is a prime example  but it also applies to voyager  ds9 and enterprise  the only ones exempt from this rule are tos  which had only 3 seasons and seemed like a rollercoaster of quality up and down until a lesser s3  and tas  which basically has 1 season  but it s split 16 6 across both seasons weirdlyanyway  the term  growing the beard  is obviously a reference to how riker grew a beard for season 2 of tng  which coincidently resulted in a better season for tng  and i think discovery has grown it s beardthe first season was mixed to say the least  i hold to my heart that magic to make the sanest man go mad is one of the great time travel episodes in the franchise  and the characters are mostly all charming and likeable  but their journey is more of a slow walk through mud  we spend half of it in the mirror universe  part of it is all about burnham s disobedience  and then the rest is sort of just filler between those two beats  and the enterprise arrival at the end seems to be a begging to entice the show to be renewed  if it wasn t already bts  just like the best of both worlds before it  but instead of pulling this card after 3 seasons  they re pulling it right out of the gate  the second season is a major shift though  we get the show being embedded into the star trek universe  more familiar faces and places show up  and pike literally kicks the crew into being    well    a crew  we get discussions of faith like new eden  classical throwbacks like if memory serves  and a season wide mystery about the red angels  it still hangs onto some of the weaker elements of the first season  like tyler and the klingons  but the new stuff is more than enticing then the third season had a lot to prove  was this raise in quality a product of bringing in these legacy characters like pike  or better quality on the show  and it seems to be the latter  now i thought the first episode was a disappointment  it seemed like it was the zany michael from the first season all over again  throw in a few action scenes  and that s it  but starting with the second episode  we get that volta with the time jump  we see the emotional effects of their journey  we get resolution to story arcs 30 years in the making  they develop these characters further in both their weakness and their strengths  they have a mission  they have a mystery  and god damn you know they re gonna solve it  every episode except the first has been a rollercoaster for me  and saru man  finally he gets his long overdue promotion and he is already surpassed numerous other main cast captains  sure  it s his first days of captaincy  but he accepts the role in full swing  and is more than competent  he is not afraid to sanction his officers  but he s not going to ignore their personal lives like picard either  he is driven by protecting and discovering  but he s not going to break every rule in the book to get to that point like a few captains we ve known  it s clear now why the show is renewed for season 4 and filming  and now we can get a better picture of why cbs want this baby to run the whole 7 seasons  if you want to move the franchise forward  it helps to have the show move forward in time  like literally all the other series apart from ent before it  which arguably was such a step back in time  that trek lost it s footing and fell over  now in the future  they can write their own future without being bound by tos edging closer and closer  and i hope to see this show ride on as it is nowstar trek discovery has finally grown it s beard

I really tried with discovery twice now. The leap forward fixed the glaring issue with plot that I hated (though I would live to see what they'll do with klingon aesthetics in this future lmao).

The other problem that still hasn't been resolved are the characters. Burnham remains completely unlikable but in different ways now... she's so fucking selfish its absolutely painful to watch. She truly believes she's the centre of the universe. The rest of the characters are simple and not fleshed out, and when they have character development it happens so quickly as to seen irrational and like a total 180. 

Its poorly written. Moreover, the overall direction and premise as been a rapprochement to star wars style, which sickens me. Lower decks is the only of the new shows that has so far been meritable imo. Picard was buoyed by returns from favorites and good acting, but suffers the same problems with storyline and ridiculous, non relatable or approachable characters. That's not what Trek is about.","I have tried really hard, but I still can't like discovery.",i really tried with discovery twice now  the leap forward fixed the glaring issue with plot that i hated  though i would live to see what they ll do with klingon aesthetics in this future lmao  the other problem that still hasn t been resolved are the characters  burnham remains completely unlikable but in different ways now    she s so fucking selfish its absolutely painful to watch  she truly believes she s the centre of the universe  the rest of the characters are simple and not fleshed out  and when they have character development it happens so quickly as to seen irrational and like a total 180  its poorly written  moreover  the overall direction and premise as been a rapprochement to star wars style  which sickens me  lower decks is the only of the new shows that has so far been meritable imo  picard was buoyed by returns from favorites and good acting  but suffers the same problems with storyline and ridiculous  non relatable or approachable characters  that s not what trek is about i have tried really hard  but i still can t like discovery

0,"The new episode has premiered on Netflix so I've checked the translations in languages I know. Unfortunately, the translations of Adira's coming out as non-binary are mostly less than stellar.

In Polish, Adira says something like (""nigdy nie identyfikowałam się jako kobieta, więc wolę 'oni'"") ""I never identified as a woman, and so I prefer 'they'"" (as in, the Polish plural pronoun, which btw is also gendered) but in Polish changing just the pronoun or even just the third person verbs to agree with the pronoun (like they do in the later scene, using plurals) is not enough! While some Polish non-binary people use the plural (although it's mostly a calque from English), they also need to do it in the first person (especially in the past tense), since otherwise verbs like ""identified"" are also gendered. Here's an overview of how it works in Polish: [https://zaimki.pl/english](https://zaimki.pl/english)

In Latin American Spanish it's even worse! It's ""nunca me he sentido como una persona, entonces prefiero 'ellos'"", which means ""I never identified as one person, so I prefer 'they'"". The translator completely misunderstood it (probably based on their Trill memories) and thought that ""they"" here refers to them feeling as a plural entity instead of just one person.

Out of the languages I've checked, only the translator to Spain Spanish actually used non-binary pronouns used by Spanish people (""elle"") instead of, at best, using a calque of ""they"" as a plural form that isn't actually used much in a given language.",Adira – disappointing translations,the new episode has premiered on netflix so i ve checked the translations in languages i know  unfortunately  the translations of adira s coming out as non binary are mostly less than stellar in polish  adira says something like   nigdy nie identyfikowałam się jako kobieta  więc wolę  oni     i never identified as a woman  and so i prefer  they    as in  the polish plural pronoun  which btw is also gendered  but in polish changing just the pronoun or even just the third person verbs to agree with the pronoun  like they do in the later scene  using plurals  is not enough  while some polish non binary people use the plural  although it s mostly a calque from english   they also need to do it in the first person  especially in the past tense   since otherwise verbs like  identified  are also gendered  here s an overview of how it works in polish   in latin american spanish it s even worse  it s  nunca me he sentido como una persona  entonces prefiero  ellos    which means  i never identified as one person  so i prefer  they    the translator completely misunderstood it  probably based on their trill memories  and thought that  they  here refers to them feeling as a plural entity instead of just one person out of the languages i ve checked  only the translator to spain spanish actually used non binary pronouns used by spanish people   elle   instead of  at best  using a calque of  they  as a plural form that isn t actually used much in a given language adira   disappointing translations

0,"I’m rewatching the TNG/DS9/VOY episodes in air date order. I’m now watching “The Chase.” And after all the times I’ve watched this episode, and I’m old enough to have watched it when it first aired, I still love this episode.

-	Norman Lloyd: I mean, to see him with Patrick Stewart is such a treat.
-	John Cothran, Jr.: such a fun-spirited Klingon. His scenes with Data are TNG comedy done well (not something done that often).
-	Linda Thorson: perhaps it’s a recipe for biscuits. Seeing Cardassians in TNG interwoven with DS9 really helps cement DS9 as part of the Star Trek universe (and of course it is, but it’s nice to see them this way.
-	“Perhaps…one day”: the whole story of humanoids DNA carrying a message for eons is such classic Star Trek. Crisscrossing the galaxy, battling Cardassians and Romulans while trying to piece together a puzzle as old as life itself while maintaining humor throughout is everything ST V wanted to be…but wasn’t.

And permit an older fan to wax nostalgic. Back in the before the Internet was really a thing days, there was a fan theory of “The Providers,” which I can’t remember if they were associated with the Triskelions or not…it’s been a while. But the fan theory was that they were the first humanoid life and they scattered their seed across the galaxy, and many of the humanoid life we see in the 23rd century (TOS days) were from them. That explained why so many aliens looked roughly human-like. I mean, costume and makeup budgets and technology being what it was in the 60s and 70s.

So to see Salome Jens as this first of the humanoid life felt like a fan theory confirmed back in 1993.

Also, Salome Jens also made my watch of DS9 confusing. DS9 premiered as I was graduating college, and I wasn’t able to give it the same viewing on tv as I had TNG.

0,"I was always troubled by Guinan’s conversation with Riker in the ready room following Picard’s abduction and assimilation in *The Best of Both Worlds: Part II* (season 4, episode 1).

It was an excellent and persuasive argument that Riker needed to receive in order to proceed in the manner that was necessary: A ship can only have one captain, we must all let go of Picard, and you can trust me on that because our relationship goes beyond friendship and family — and you know it.

Guinan’s “motivational” argument was borne from a pessimistic and defeatist stance, which is so uncharacteristic of this world and it never sat right with me, even consider that Guinan’s people were nearly wiped out by the Borg.

I posit that Guinan was only able to make this painful argument to Riker because she held the knowledge that the events of *Time’s Arrow, Part I* (season 5, episode 26) and *Time’s Arrow, Part II* (season 6, episode 1) had not yet occurred.",Hypothesis: Guinan knew that she could safely and convincingly counsel Commander Riker to abandon Picard when he was assimilated by the Borg because she knew the events of Time’s Arrow had not yet taken place.,i was always troubled by guinan s conversation with riker in the ready room following picard s abduction and assimilation in  the best of both worlds  part ii   season 4  episode 1  it was an excellent and persuasive argument that riker needed to receive in order to proceed in the manner that was necessary  a ship can only have one captain  we must all let go of picard  and you can trust me on that because our relationship goes beyond friendship and family   and you know it guinan s  motivational  argument was borne from a pessimistic and defeatist stance  which is so uncharacteristic of this world and it never sat right with me  even consider that guinan s people were nearly wiped out by the borg i posit that guinan was only able to make this painful argument to riker because she held the knowledge that the events of  time s arrow  part i   season 5  episode 26  and  time s arrow  part ii   season 6  episode 1  had not yet occurred hypothesis  guinan knew that she could safely and convincingly counsel commander riker to abandon picard when he was assimilated by the borg because she knew the events of time s arrow had not yet taken place

___

**Episode 37 - ""The Sanctuary""**

* There is an episode of DS9 called ""Sanctuary,"" though it has no resemblance whatsoever to this installment.
* The subplot of the episode revolves around Saru choosing a command catchphrase; Carol Freeman faced a similar dilemma in ""Envoys.""
* Michael warns against Book's ship surviving ""transwarp."" Transwarp has had multiple meanings over the years, from *Excelsior's* experimental propulsion system to the Borg's preferred method of travel to the new invention in ""Threshold."" Generally speaking, it is the ""next step up"" from regular warp drive.
* Emerald Chain's MO seems to be roaming the galaxy solving problems at steep prices. The eponymous gang in ""Think Tank"" had a similar role.
* We get a slightly better look at the map in Vance's office, and the previously-seen ""Klingon Zone"" includes the homeworld of Qo'noS.
* Osyraa fiddles with a combadge from the PIC era.
* Osyraa's lair is filled with scrap, and at 6:10 there is a passing shot of a console with a round central display and a joystick. Although it seems to be connected to some kind of dilithium End Portal, I would not be surprised if it was a callback of some kind, but I would have no idea where it would be from.
* Tolor is tossed into a room with a giant ravenous creature, a staple of the franchise. Well, not *this* franchise...
* The hidden signal is an SOS hidden under a melody. In ""Menage a Troi"" Riker took background noise and hid an SOS in the form of a melody. Additionally, the last time a crew found a distorted song being broadcast was in *The Voyage Home.*
* Detmer is here established as something of a hotshot pilot, evoking Tom Paris, who would take the *Delta Flyer* out for side missions and joyrides.
* Osyraa's ship is called the *Viridian;* the Veridian system is where the *Enteprrise-D* was destroyed.","Canon References - ""The Sanctuary"" [Spoilers]",previous episodes                                                            dis s1      e01 02      e03      e04      e05      e06      e07      e08        e09      e10      e11      e12      e13      e14      e15    dis s2      e01      e02      e03      e04      e05      e06      e07        e08      e09      e10      e11      e12      e13      e14        dis s3      e01      e02      e03      e04      e05      e06      e07        e08  sts s1      st01      st02      st03      st04      sts s2      st05      st06      st07      st08 09      st10      pic      e01      e02      e03      e04      e05      e06      e07          e08      e09      e10      ld      e01      e02      e03      e04      e05      e06      e07         e08      e09      e10    episode 37    the sanctuary     there is an episode of ds9 called  sanctuary   though it has no resemblance whatsoever to this installment   the subplot of the episode revolves around saru choosing a command catchphrase  carol freeman faced a similar dilemma in  envoys    michael warns against book s ship surviving  transwarp   transwarp has had multiple meanings over the years  from  excelsior s  experimental propulsion system to the borg s preferred method of travel to the new invention in  threshold   generally speaking  it is the  next step up  from regular warp drive   emerald chain s mo seems to be roaming the galaxy solving problems at steep prices  the eponymous gang in  think tank  had a similar role   we get a slightly better look at the map in vance s office  and the previously seen  klingon zone  includes the homeworld of qo nos   osyraa fiddles with a combadge from the pic era   osyraa s lair is filled with scrap  and at 6 10 there is a passing shot of a console with a round central display and a joystick  although it seems to be connected to some kind of dilithium end portal  i would not be surprised if it was a callback of some kind  but i would have no idea where it would be from   tolor is tossed into a room with a giant ravenous creature  a staple of the franchise  well  not  this  franchise     the hidden signal is an sos hidden under a melody  in  menage a troi  riker took background noise and hid an sos in the form of a melody  additionally  the last time a crew found a distorted song being broadcast was in  the voyage home    detmer is here established as something of a hotshot pilot  evoking tom paris  who would take the  delta flyer  out for side missions and joyrides   osyraa s ship is called the  viridian   the veridian system is where the  enteprrise d  was destroyed canon references    the sanctuary   spoilers

My fave Star Trek shows are in order:

0,"Some brief thoughts on Adira’s character from Discovery 3x8 “Sanctuary”. Mild spoilers below. (The title is tongue-in-cheek but I couldn’t resist.)

&gt;!I’m really glad to finally see a non-binary character, and I really like their portrayal overall, especially in episode 3x4 “Forget Me Not”, which is one of my favorite of the series, and perhaps of Star Trek generally. How they handled them coming out to Stamets, however, feels a bit anachronistic (in the sense of being out of *the crew’s* time, not out of our own time). It wasn’t necessary to have a big coming out scene and then a later scene where Stamets and Hugh use their pronouns about 15 times in the course of a few sentences just to drive it home. I get the significance, and I get that Star Trek has always been a way to tell stories about contemporary humanity, but when it comes to matters of race, gender, and sexuality, it’s generally done so best when it’s shown what a more inclusive world looks like, rather than projecting our current inadequacies into the future. Adira should just be a non-binary character like Stamets and Hugh are gay, Uhura is a black woman, etc., and everyone should know, and we should periodically see how that affects them, etc., but it shouldn’t be a Big Deal.

In an episode of the Babysitter’s Club earlier this year, there was a transgender character, and it *was* a big deal to her, and there was a scene in which someone had to be dressed-down for not referring to her properly. That was appropriate, because it took place in the 21st century! I’d hope by the 32nd century we’d be well past the need for that.!&lt;",Battle of the Non-Binary Star,some brief thoughts on adira s character from discovery 3x8  sanctuary   mild spoilers below   the title is tongue in cheek but i couldn t resist   gt  i m really glad to finally see a non binary character  and i really like their portrayal overall  especially in episode 3x4  forget me not   which is one of my favorite of the series  and perhaps of star trek generally  how they handled them coming out to stamets  however  feels a bit anachronistic  in the sense of being out of  the crew s  time  not out of our own time   it wasn t necessary to have a big coming out scene and then a later scene where stamets and hugh use their pronouns about 15 times in the course of a few sentences just to drive it home  i get the significance  and i get that star trek has always been a way to tell stories about contemporary humanity  but when it comes to matters of race  gender  and sexuality  it s generally done so best when it s shown what a more inclusive world looks like  rather than projecting our current inadequacies into the future  adira should just be a non binary character like stamets and hugh are gay  uhura is a black woman  etc   and everyone should know  and we should periodically see how that affects them  etc   but it shouldn t be a big deal in an episode of the babysitter s club earlier this year  there was a transgender character  and it  was  a big deal to her  and there was a scene in which someone had to be dressed down for not referring to her properly  that was appropriate  because it took place in the 21st century  i d hope by the 32nd century we d be well past the need for that   lt battle of the non binary star

Stay with me here:

- Cue the USS Discovery, jumping from place to place as usual.

- Upon arrival after some random, long distance jump, Discovery's sonar beeps with unknown contacts.  On one of those contacts is a starfleet officer, Ensign Ro (Michelle Forbes).

-Immediately, Discovery beams her aboard from a ship marked *""Pegasus""*.  She arrives on the transporter pad standing in silent shock, with welling tears, at the exact moment Caprica Six has a pistol aimed at her face.  Discovery then makes a clean get away.

Ensign Ro is back in the federation fleet from being stranded undercover in the Colonial Fleet as Admiral Cain.  Clearly she's aged.  Wiser, a Razor.

Ro deserves to be written off in such a great way.  Michelle Forbes was a great actress in both shows and is basically the same badass anyway.

With Discovery jumping ahead, there isn’t exactly a blank slate of the future after Picard.  

The crews of each franchise had windows to that future... examples are: 

- the kleptomaniac on TNG, from their past, who stole a time ship from a dude in the future. 

- a time ship in 20th century San Francisco that provided the Doctor’s mobile emitter.

I’ve wanted a First Contact Era uniform for as long as I can remember. What with the ‘Rona lockdowns and holiday season upon us, I’ve decided to start looking in to what it takes to get a uniform.

To that end- I’m a big guy. 6’5 and a solid 235lbs. Most off the rack or “XL” stuff just doesn’t fit me. Sleeves too short, chest too tight, etc. I have to order primarily through Big and Tall stores because nothing ever fits.

0,"Something occured to me the other day about the mirror universe.

Terran history diverged from human history since at least Zefram Cochrane's time and likely well before then (ENT: In a Mirror Darkly).

It would be unbelievably unlikely that hundreds or thousands of years after diverging that any of the same people exist in both universes given the differences between terrans and humans. People would choose partners differently or die before reproducing or any number of other factors would lead to entirely different sets of people in both universes.

However, in all the mirror universe episodes across the franchise everyone always has a counterpart.

Obviously the real answer is that it is a convenient plot device, but this must imply some kind of metaphysical reason that explains it in universe. Does the universe require balance on an individual level? What about the ships that are carbon copies of each other with different paint jobs? Even crews can remain largely the same between them. The implications of any reason for this could be very profound if explored.

As far as I remember this idea has never been touched on in the franchise but it would be cool if they did.",Implications of mirror universe duplicates,something occured to me the other day about the mirror universe terran history diverged from human history since at least zefram cochrane s time and likely well before then  ent  in a mirror darkly  it would be unbelievably unlikely that hundreds or thousands of years after diverging that any of the same people exist in both universes given the differences between terrans and humans  people would choose partners differently or die before reproducing or any number of other factors would lead to entirely different sets of people in both universes however  in all the mirror universe episodes across the franchise everyone always has a counterpart obviously the real answer is that it is a convenient plot device  but this must imply some kind of metaphysical reason that explains it in universe  does the universe require balance on an individual level  what about the ships that are carbon copies of each other with different paint jobs  even crews can remain largely the same between them  the implications of any reason for this could be very profound if explored as far as i remember this idea has never been touched on in the franchise but it would be cool if they did implications of mirror universe duplicates

0,"(Marked for Discovery spoilers)  
So I'm relatively new to the show (introduced through Discovery &amp; Picard, working my way through Next Generation currently) so feel free to make me aware of inaccuracies, but these two schools of thought genuinely fascinate me, not so much for their differences, but for their similarities.

If I understand it correctly:

* Vulcan philosophy seeks purely the path of logic in order to find and express the ultimate truth.
* The Qowat Milat's Way of Absolute Candour seeks purely emotional transparency to find and express the ultimate truth.

Despite the opposing method of revealing the truth, the essence of their intent is the same and the self-discipline (meditation, training, etc) required to achieve these extremities is also very similar.

To combine them, so that is to be both emotionally honest AND logically sound-minded, would be a very powerful philosophy to maintain. Knowing you are speaking truthfully about your emotions implies you are distinctly aware of what those emotions are. Awareness of their existence allows you to better understand their source and nature. To then temper but not repress these emotions based on their source but as an onlooker through a locus of logic would result in an answer that is both emotionally aware and logically sound. 

This would likely achieve more in a socially diverse society (like Ni'Var) that requires solutions to a range of viewpoints than it ever would in a homogenous society like on (old) Vulcan.

Perhaps this would be the ultimate philosophical understanding Burnham needs to come to in Discovery in order to properly find her place again, not only in Starfleet, but also as a member of Vulcan and Human society. Her conclusion to withdraw her request in the latest episode could point towards this development!

Are there any examples of Vulcans or Romulans like this in canon?

0,"What I really mean is, how important is the position of ""first officer"" important?

In TOS, Spock was the science officer. He was also the first officer, but really, most of the time, to anyone watching, he was a science officer. His uniform was science-blue, not command-gold. Sure he'd sit in the captain's chair when Kirk was away, but aside from that, he didn't have any big first-officer-duties as far as I can recall.

In TNG, however, Riker was the full-time first officer, without any other role. The Enterprise D is a heck of a lot bigger, so it makes sense they might need more management-type positions to organize the crew.

With Discovery, we're back to a small crew, so I wonder if the formal position of first officer is necessary. Yes, of course someone has to be second-in-command, since that's how the chain of command works, but it seems like they could have gotten away with demoting Burnham's, and just making sure someone besides Saru outranks her.",Does a ship really need a first officer?,what i really mean is  how important is the position of  first officer  important in tos  spock was the science officer  he was also the first officer  but really  most of the time  to anyone watching  he was a science officer  his uniform was science blue  not command gold  sure he d sit in the captain s chair when kirk was away  but aside from that  he didn t have any big first officer duties as far as i can recall in tng  however  riker was the full time first officer  without any other role  the enterprise d is a heck of a lot bigger  so it makes sense they might need more management type positions to organize the crew with discovery  we re back to a small crew  so i wonder if the formal position of first officer is necessary  yes  of course someone has to be second in command  since that s how the chain of command works  but it seems like they could have gotten away with demoting burnham s  and just making sure someone besides saru outranks her does a ship really need a first officer

0,"I'm writing this with an open mind, as a lifelong fan of Trek, hoping that someone can perhaps answer my criticisms in a way that might make me see Discovery differently.  


I grew up watching TNG with my dad. I've watched every episode of every show multiple times -- even Enterprise, which I thoroughly enjoyed despite the general consesus that it wasn't all that good. In Discovery's first two seasons I had the same problems as everyone else, mostly around how the show seemed to trample all over established canon. But despite this, I more-or-less enjoyed the first two seasons. But I find myself unable to stomach the third season. I'll jump right into the reason why:  


In Season 3, being 900-years out of place has forced the crew to come together as a family. This is a character-building element that a lot of fans wish Voyager had had more of. But with Voyager, the Maquis / Starfleet angle got resolved much too soon, everyone but B'Elanna seemed completely resigned to the realities of their lifelong journey almost immediately, and it's as if Janeway's decision to continue running the ship as if it were still a Starfleet vessel in the Alpha Quadrant curtailed either the writers' desire or ability to portray Voyager as a nascent family rather than a crew of colleagues. Discovery won't make the same mistake: a crew stranded among strangers naturally becomes a family. OK, good. But we know \*nothing\* about over half the regulars on the show. And for me, that completely undermines the overarching story they're trying to tell.  


In Season 3, the bridge crew aren't individuals; they're a singular character -- the bridge officers -- that get brought out for, honestly, cringy, campy scenes like reminiscing under the tree at Starfleet Academy, or sharing a meal with Saru, or smiling and going 'ah cool!' as they get new badges, or one-by-one telling Tilly to ''just say yes,'' despite the fact that she may be the most unqualified commanding officer that we've ever seen (it would be like Janeway giving Harry Kim the position as First Officer over Chakotay or Tuvoc, but if Harry Kim had no self-confidence or leadership qualities whatsoever). But why did Tilly get the nod? Well, who else could have?! Who is Rhys? Who is Bryce? Who is Owosekun (I had to look up her name because I forgot)? Who is the blonde woman whose name I literally don't even know despite the fact that she's in every scene with the bridge crew? What do we know about Detmer besides the fact that she has PTSD from flying the ship through the wormhole?   


The bridge crew are basically extras. They show up once in awhile, smile, clap, give each other hugs, and then we get back to the Michael Burnham show. And I didn't mind it being the Michael Burnham show during seasons 1 and 2. Sure, it bothered me that the bridge crew were an irrelevant afterthought without backgrounds, whose names I couldn't even remember most of the time, but it wasn't detrimental to the overarching narrative. In Season 3, however, the writers are trying to tell me that these clearly irrelevant afterthoughts that they've put zero effort into fleshing out are actually characters with depth; a family that I should care about. When Commander Nhan decided to stay behind, I thought ''OK, who cares?'' The only things I knew about her were things I had learned 5 minutes prior, in that very same episode. But her decision to stay was supposed to carry weight -- we're losing a 'member of the crew.' And imagine, we knew more about her than any of the bridge crew and she \*wasn't even part of the Discovery crew.\*  


And that's the problem for me: there is no crew. There's Michael Burnham, there's Saru (only from the halfway point of Season 2; prior to that were \~20 episodes with a First Officer we knew hardly anything about), and to a lesser extent there are Stamets, Tilly, and Georgiou. But the 'family' that Discovery insists exists is a farce. And the insistance that it isn't only makes me want to know more about the bridge crew -- to understand them as individuals, to fall in love with them like I have the crews of the various Enterprises, DS9, and Voyager. And I keep expecting the show to develop the bridge crew's characters. But it never does. And so, for me, Season 3 took the fact that the bridge crew are clearly an afterthought from 'annoying' to 'inexcusable'. I don't know that I can watch another 7 or 8 episodes in which Rhys smiling or Detmer being stressed is considered character development.  


Am I wrong? I love Star Trek so much. And I want so badly to love Discovery, too. It wasn't so hard when all I had to do was pretend that the Spore Drive somehow fit with canon, or pretend that the new Klingons didn't look a bit silly; but now the show's asking me to pretend that its invested in characters who may as well be nameless. And yet, I see online that the general consensus among fans is that Season 3 is incredible. What am I missing? Help me love Discovery, too.",I so desperately want to love Discovery -- and its crew.

me to pretend that its invested in characters who may as well be nameless  and yet  i see online that the general consensus among fans is that season 3 is incredible  what am i missing  help me love discovery  too i so desperately want to love discovery    and its crew  please help
0,"Honestly, I  love CBS content, even before NBC (The Office) but I wish they didn’t have such a sway into the future of Star Trek. 

I’m about 2 seasons into DS9, after watching TNG a solid 3 times, Enterprise, the full 1-10 movies multiple times in sequence, and TOS. 

They’re all clearly distinctively different and unique, and that’s very much art. I just hope for something to come for DS9. 

DS9 is a neglected child. TNG has most seasons in 1080p with remastered models and updated effects and film, same with TOS. I really do think that TOS has  significant improvements with the remasters (especially in retrospect when you compare Disney and Star Wars getting so many modifications from the original theatrical release etc) 

Who do we need to contact from CBS to get remastered DS9. They must have original film or digital archives! The effects are all something around 480p!?!? This franchise deserves better. 

All I’m saying is, put in the ***legitimate*** effort, I’m one of countless others they will buy a copy of blu-ray DS9 with remastered effects, audio, picture etc. it’s a disgrace that the primary source is Netflix with at best 480p to 1080p upscales. 

TL;DR; CBS, please give us an HD Deep Space 9 &lt;3

If you have any pull with CBS, please make it so, number one. 

I know you guys are all about the money, but even if you don’t make it, I’m sure you’ll at least break even. 🥺🥺

0,"I think it's quite obvious on the surface that Bajor is an allegory for India, they both went through a long occupation by a foreign force, they both are deeply religious. Talking about religion specifically, the Bajorans just like the Hindus had a caste system that determined their jobs and other things called Djarras. That makes them have a quite close connection. However the most unusual connection is their history of flight. Much like the Bajorans, there is a Hindu text called the ""Vimanas"" which details how to create a possible spacecraft or aircraft. The Bajorans also had text that showed how to build a solar wind based space craft, and by building a replica, Sisko proved it was true. This made the Bajorans the first to achieve space travel. I'm not saying that what's in the Vimanas is true, but it's quite crazy how they're so incredibly similar.

The Federation is portrayed as a paradise where all problems have been solved, yet in spite of their supposed enlightenment, future humans struggle to appreciate cultures that are too unlike their own. Aside from Dax, who among the crew respects Ferengi culture? It's a bit close minded to regard them as being culturally primitive when their history is free of large scale wars and other blights humanity not only suffered but came close to destroying themselves with.

Enter the Watti. Sisko is not only completely put off by their lack of interest in Star Fleet first contact protocols, he apparently spent several hours at Quark's bar watching them play games without ever once trying to engage them on that level. He even refers to their game playing as ""childish"" when he speaks to Jake later. While being stuck inside of a game with no idea of what is in store for you might be scary, even after he sees everyone is fine after the game is over, Sisko still tears into the Watti representative. It's hardly a wonder we never see them again.

Move Along Home might be one of the clearest examples of the Federation's hypocrisy in DS9. They want to encounter new life and new civilizations...just as long as they aren't *too* new. The Bajorans need more aid? Well, they'll just have to become more like us and join up! What's that, the Cardassians are breaking another treaty and behaving savagely? Oh well!

Current Theory: Vulcan's Mature at the same rate as Humans until they finish the second-stage of Puberty at 20-30. 

Yes, Vulcan's live longer than Humans, but they also exist on a Hell-World where most non-plant species can't afford to wait 20 years for a child to develop enough to survive alone in the wilds if mom dies to a predator. Nor can society wait 30 years for a Farmer to grow up from a hungry, horny gremlin into a competent worker. Basically, the same pressures that forced Vulcans to evolve stronger and smarter than Humans, also includes a truly TERRIBLE puberty that forces them to develop along the same time-tables as Humans until adult-hood where their biology begins to slow-down.

0,"Sorry for the dramatic post title, but I'm feeling super emotional at the moment and may also be just a little bit drunk so please bear with me...

Like probably so many others, I've been using a large chunk of this covid lockdown time to get caught up on tv that I've been meaning to watch for years, and I've FINALLY started on Star Trek. And do you ever get that feeling that something is just kind of FOR YOU, and it has been all along, even if you haven't known it, but now that you're here you're home?

That's how I feel about Star Trek. I sort of always knew that I would like it, but I wasn't prepared for just how much it would resonate with me. Particularly TNG. I watched TOS and enjoyed quite a lot of it, but TNG is like....MY SHOW. I'm a completist and would never even consider skipping episodes XD so I've watched it all, and I even love the first two seasons, despite their often hot-mess-itude! To me, they are fun on their own for what they are and  just make the shift  to greatness in the later seasons even more enjoyable! Of course, as someone who wasn't even born when the show started airing and can now just Netflix it, it's probably easier to forgive when you know you can just keep watching until it gets better. 

It's probably easier for me to forgive a lot of things! For example, I don't totally hate Wesley! Sure he's a big ol Mary Sue a lot of the time, but for the most part I find him pretty adorable! For some reason, every episode featuring Barclay feels like fanfiction to me, but it's cool! Lwaxana Troi is an angel and brings some much-needed fashion moments to the show! All the opinions about Q being the best are 100 percent correct! 

I'm jealous of people who got to experience the show in real time. I can't even imagine how I would have reacted at the end of Best of Both Worlds Part 1 back when it first aired. I, a 25 year old woman in 2020, was literally screaming in my apartment as that amazing music cue faded and had to immediately call my Star Trek-loving Uncle to scream over the phone to him, but was able to watch the next part right after. Had I been a kid watching this show back in the day, I think I would have lost my mind.

Anyway, this is all just to say thank you to this community, because I've enjoyed coming here after watching episodes and searching for discussions to see what people had to say, even though I've never participated. It has definitely added a nice dimension to my journey into the world of Star Trek, which I don't intend to stop anytime soon! I am a bit worried that I'll never love anything as much as I love TNG (I just love it so much, help!) but I fully intend to watch it all.

0,"It is the first time I'm watching TNG and I have just seen ""The Outcast"",  an interesting episode in which Riker falls for Soren, an androgynous shuttlecraft pilot. Even nowadays, with gender affairs being openly debated, I found the episode provocative and well-written, despite the cruelty in the last scenes. Can you imagine this on TV in 1992?   


As season 5 became more popular every day, many critics raise questions concerning the way the episode depicts an allegory for sexual identity. One issue is that Soren identifying herself as a female was not mandatory in the story.  In any case, I am trying to look at this episode from another perspective. What struck me the most is how intense the Will-Soren relationship becomes, and this dialogue between Will and Deanna:

\---

W: I met someone - someone who has become important to me. 

D: Soren.

W: Yes. You're my friend I thought... I don't know, I thought I should tell you.

D: I'm glad you did.

W: Nothing will change between us, will it? 

D: Of course it will. All relationships are constantly changing. But we'll still be friends, maybe better friends. You're a part of my life, and I'm part of yours. That much will always be true.

Will smiles and kisses her.   
\---  


IMO the message here is that we, as human beings, are mutable. We keep changing the way we identify ourselves, our sexuality, the way we perceive others.  Therefore, our relationships must be as dynamic as we are. Despite all the controversy of the ""conversion therapy"" at the end of the episode, I considered this episode completely underrated.

Beside artificial gravity and other things they didn't cheap out on how space flight would be achieved. I was watching TNG where the get caught in a interstellar boobie trap. They get caught in some form of radiation. Somehow it causes their shields to begin decaying. Dr. Crusher mentions how once the shield goes down the radiation will effect the crew and passengers. All hands will die after 30 minutes of exposure. 

Although it isnt stated you can imagine the Shields were not initially designed for protecting the ships from attack, but more likely interstellar radiation. Its a real issue with space flight today, we may not be able to withstand the radiation. Once we travel outside the atmosphere nothing is really protecting us anymore. We get hot with so much UV radiation that our cells die off. That is why we are researching so that when we leave it can be for longer than a trip to the moon. Of course I dont think the ISS is so far outside the farthest layers of our atmosphere that it matter a huge amount.

Sorry for the tangent,  it I love how Star Trek isn't like Star Wars. You can't just do whatever you want. It still exists in our world of physics and consequence.

I get that they’re 900 years into the future and away from all they know and love and feel really emotional, but they tend to cry over every little matter. 

Instance 1: When Michael Burnham gets demoted from First Officer after knowingly disobeying the captains order to go and rescue Book. Why does she have to cry? She should’ve known the consequences for her actions will have an effect on the image the crew is trying to from with the new federation.

0,"Don't get me wrong.  I liked Tasha fine.  She was no better or worse than any of the other bland characterizations of secondary characters in the 1st season.  But the show was really crowded.  Too many actors to get pushed to the side, and with Tasha gone, you had Worf take his rightful place heading security.

Think about the original Trek: You had two leads (Kirk and Spock), two secondaries, McCoy and Scott, and then 3 or 4 recurring background characters that may or may not get much dialogue at all (Sulu, Uhura and Rand for the 1st season, Chekov the 2nd).  That's only 7, with most of them more background than anything else.  (Note: Yes, i know one could argue that McCoy was a lead.)

But with TNG, they switched to more of an ensemble cast, with 1 lead and 8 secondaries which all had more screen time than than their counterparts on TOS.  That makes for a very bloated cast in story-telling.  I'm not a Wesley hater, but for the simple reason of space, he should have never been a cast member either.  If anything, i would have rather seen Tasha at the helm, and dump Troi entirely, as she was not necessary to the crew.

Thoughts?",Denise Crosby leaving TNG was the best thing that happened to the show,don t get me wrong   i liked tasha fine   she was no better or worse than any of the other bland characterizations of secondary characters in the 1st season   but the show was really crowded   too many actors to get pushed to the side  and with tasha gone  you had worf take his rightful place heading security think about the original trek  you had two leads  kirk and spock   two secondaries  mccoy and scott  and then 3 or 4 recurring background characters that may or may not get much dialogue at all  sulu  uhura and rand for the 1st season  chekov the 2nd    that s only 7  with most of them more background than anything else    note  yes  i know one could argue that mccoy was a lead  but with tng  they switched to more of an ensemble cast  with 1 lead and 8 secondaries which all had more screen time than than their counterparts on tos   that makes for a very bloated cast in story telling   i m not a wesley hater  but for the simple reason of space  he should have never been a cast member either   if anything  i would have rather seen tasha at the helm  and dump troi entirely  as she was not necessary to the crew in any case  whichever characters are your least favorites  actor bloat meant someone had to go     and by actor bloat  i m not talking about jonathan frakes   love ya  big guy   thoughts denise crosby leaving tng was the best thing that happened to the show

0,I think what the federation should do is build mobile shipyards.  Huge ships that have dry dock facilities to build smaller ships.  And that have the ability to mine fuel and raw materials as they travel through space.  That way they could build their ships on the fly.  And they could use holograms and robots to build ships faster then humans can.  They could send one of these ships to an unexplored region and by the time it got there it could have constructed dozens of ships.  That way one ship becomes dozens and even hundreds.  The mobile shipyard could even be designed to be extended to build larger ships or other mobile shipyards.  So send one of these ships to the edge of the delta quadrant and by the time it got there it could be thousands or tens of thousands of ships.  If the federation built a dozen of these they could expand out to every corner of the galaxy.  So anyway let me know what you think in the comments.,Mobile Shipyards,i think what the federation should do is build mobile shipyards   huge ships that have dry dock facilities to build smaller ships   and that have the ability to mine fuel and raw materials as they travel through space   that way they could build their ships on the fly   and they could use holograms and robots to build ships faster then humans can   they could send one of these ships to an unexplored region and by the time it got there it could have constructed dozens of ships   that way one ship becomes dozens and even hundreds   the mobile shipyard could even be designed to be extended to build larger ships or other mobile shipyards   so send one of these ships to the edge of the delta quadrant and by the time it got there it could be thousands or tens of thousands of ships   if the federation built a dozen of these they could expand out to every corner of the galaxy   so anyway let me know what you think in the comments mobile shipyards

0,"I was under the impression that Michael's quest to solve the Burn was a weird obsession, because albeit an understandable goal, I can't see why it's so urgent that she's breaking all the rules to do it immediately. There is no reason to believe it would change anything in the short term, is it? Discussing it with other people, however, it seems some are under the impression that solving it is would possibly (or probably) restore warp travel.

I researched it to the best of my abilities, but I think we're short on details. So a few questions, just to make sure I'm not missing anything:

1) Why is warp travel gone?

To my understanding, the only thing stopping it is the lack of dilithium. Supply was already dwindling before, and I think it's implied that recrystallization isn't possible on a mass scale, maybe because burned dilithium is useless, so all they have left are the small quantities that survived for whatever reason. Fear that dilithium would explode again could stop some people from using it, but it wouldn't stop the whole galaxy.

2) Is there any reason to believe finding who or what caused The Burn will bring warp back in the short term?

Of course, it's TV, so it's possible that everything will be neatly solved in the end, and IDK, maybe the bad guys behind The Burn know how to fix burned dilithium or have been using alternative tech in secret this whole time. But is there any reason for Michael to believe that learning what happened will fix anything immediately? Because my impression is that she has this vague notion that if there's a threat behind it all the Federation will never be able to safely rebuild, which makes sense but hardly justifies lying and almost quitting Starfleet not to delay the search for a week or two. A good idea I just learned from another redditor is that if Michael proves The Burn was not caused by SB-19 the Vulcans/Romulans could get back to developing an alternative, but that doesn't seem to be Michael's plan at all (and even then, it'd be hard to buy that every single person with access to that information, and Vulcans no less, would stop studying the galaxy's only hope, something that could fix everything in a year, if it there weren't credible concerns).

So, is there any way to explain the whole The Burn drama except that Michael's unreasonably obsessed with it?",What details do we have on warp drive and dillithium on current Discovery?,i was under the impression that michael s quest to solve the burn was a weird obsession  because albeit an understandable goal  i can t see why it s so urgent that she s breaking all the rules to do it immediately  there is no reason to believe it would change anything in the short term  is it  discussing it with other people  however  it seems some are under the impression that solving it is would possibly  or probably  restore warp travel i researched it to the best of my abilities  but i think we re short on details  so a few questions  just to make sure i m not missing anything 1  why is warp travel gone to my understanding  the only thing stopping it is the lack of dilithium  supply was already dwindling before  and i think it s implied that recrystallization isn t possible on a mass scale  maybe because burned dilithium is useless  so all they have left are the small quantities that survived for whatever reason  fear that dilithium would explode again could stop some people from using it  but it wouldn t stop the whole galaxy 2  is there any reason to believe finding who or what caused the burn will bring warp back in the short term of course  it s tv  so it s possible that everything will be neatly solved in the end  and idk  maybe the bad guys behind the burn know how to fix burned dilithium or have been using alternative tech in secret this whole time  but is there any reason for michael to believe that learning what happened will fix anything immediately  because my impression is that she has this vague notion that if there s a threat behind it all the federation will never be able to safely rebuild  which makes sense but hardly justifies lying and almost quitting starfleet not to delay the search for a week or two  a good idea i just learned from another redditor is that if michael proves the burn was not caused by sb 19 the vulcans romulans could get back to developing an alternative  but that doesn t seem to be michael s plan at all  and even then  it d be hard to buy that every single person with access to that information  and vulcans no less  would stop studying the galaxy s only hope  something that could fix everything in a year  if it there weren t credible concerns  so  is there any way to explain the whole the burn drama except that michael s unreasonably obsessed with it what details do we have on warp drive and dillithium on current discovery

I remember watching it for the first time and being amazed by this universe created back in the 1960s! Now we have the Kelvin timeline, mirror universe and even gods! (The prophets).

0,"Love the newer series of Trek or hate it, but we've had a decent amount of it this year. In 2020, we started off with the final episode of *Short Treks* in 'Children of Mars', we then go into a 10 episode season of *Picard* and then a 10 episode season of *Lower Decks*, and now a 13 episode season of *Discovery* to take us into the new year. So as good as we've had it this year with content, there is a large elephant in the room. There has been little to no live action production this year. Start dates for Picard, Section 31, Strange New Worlds have all been thrown out the window, with only Disco S4 recently beginning. Animated Trek has managed to survive these delays for the most part, and is going full steam ahead

So it looks like 2021 is going to be a more vacant one. But what could we see next?

Well Lower Decks has a second season being produced side by side with the first, so that is the next candidate for release, sometime earlier in the year probably. 

We then will likely go into Star Trek Prodigy's first season on Nickelodeon in the middle of the year

And that could very well be it. The live action shows have a 1 year turnaround, and as most of them are set to start shooting next year, we can't expect PIC S2, SNW S1, S31 S1 to be out until 2022 at the earliest. The only other thing we could see in 2021 is Disco S4 beginning to air sometime in December, but that seems like it would almost certainly fall back to 2022 also. And lord knows what's up with Short Treks, for such an acclaimed series with such use, you'd think they would have announced something from it besides ""It'd be interesting to do more""

TLDR: Looks like we've got 20 weeks of animated Trek next year, and by the looks of things, we could end up seeing 6 seasons of Trek in 2022 at best, and a damn lot at worst",What's next on the schedule for Trek,love the newer series of trek or hate it  but we ve had a decent amount of it this year  in 2020  we started off with the final episode of  short treks  in  children of mars   we then go into a 10 episode season of  picard  and then a 10 episode season of  lower decks   and now a 13 episode season of  discovery  to take us into the new year  so as good as we ve had it this year with content  there is a large elephant in the room  there has been little to no live action production this year  start dates for picard  section 31  strange new worlds have all been thrown out the window  with only disco s4 recently beginning  animated trek has managed to survive these delays for the most part  and is going full steam aheadso it looks like 2021 is going to be a more vacant one  but what could we see next well lower decks has a second season being produced side by side with the first  so that is the next candidate for release  sometime earlier in the year probably  we then will likely go into star trek prodigy s first season on nickelodeon in the middle of the yearand that could very well be it  the live action shows have a 1 year turnaround  and as most of them are set to start shooting next year  we can t expect pic s2  snw s1  s31 s1 to be out until 2022 at the earliest  the only other thing we could see in 2021 is disco s4 beginning to air sometime in december  but that seems like it would almost certainly fall back to 2022 also  and lord knows what s up with short treks  for such an acclaimed series with such use  you d think they would have announced something from it besides  it d be interesting to do more tldr  looks like we ve got 20 weeks of animated trek next year  and by the looks of things  we could end up seeing 6 seasons of trek in 2022 at best  and a damn lot at worstwhat s next on the schedule for trek

So I'm watching DS9 for the first time since a few weeks and when I saw ""Looking for par'Mach in all the Wrong Places"" yesterday I noticed that the acting was somehow different. It's a little difficult to explain, but it seemed like all the actors were on a whole new level of liveliness and motivation. Be it Odo joking about Kira's relationship with O'Brien, Dax while teaching Quark how to use a bath'leth or Bashir while having a fun little chat with O'Brien - something just felt nrw about the way they portrayed their feelings. 

After being a little confused at first, I quickly began to love this ""new"" style of acting. Don't get me wrong - I loved all of the characters the way they were before, and they don't act completely new in this episode, but it feels like they have... expanded their character traits to make them even better suited as before. And there couldn't have been a better episode than this one to experiment with this new acting style.

Did anyone feel the same about this episode when they first saw it, or is it just me? And what do you think could be the reason for this rather interesting ""change""?

0,"I pretty sure everyone who remembers most of TOS noticed that every time when Gene touched screenplay it always turned into some kind of ""Gladiator"" script. ""Bread and Circuses"" is the brightest example of that. Although I like ""Savage Curtain"", he wrote a story that puts characters in a situation where they have to fight each other to please some higher power. Again.

He did not write ""The Gamesters of Triskelion"" nor ""Arena"", but these episodes got similar story tropes. Also, there is an episode about ancient Greece-like people who are more into ""Roman"" types of entertainment (""Plato's Stepchildren""). Obviously, Gene didn't have to be a writer to put his favorite things in the script, because he was the creator, the producer and that was his vision after all. Regardless of who writes the story.

I think Gene thought that characters and societies that were based on decadent, cruel aspects of ancient Rome culture are the perfect antagonists to the starship crew that represents a utopian society like the Federation. Or maybe he just loved the Roman aesthetic, I don't know...

4.  They won't be able to concentrate

That's the cause of the BURN, they were trying to burn all those calories off from the Sugar

BURN = Sugar calories, I knew it.  THIS WHOLE TIME!

Crusher and LaForge are stuck in the cargo bay and Crusher says ""Geordi, this wall is hot!"" and then Geordi responds ""Where?""

0,"Now by this I don't mean that I seriously believe that in 400 years we're going to have the Enterprise D, that Roddenberry was some prophet, or that Klingons really are out there. 

But, Star Trek has always been a part of my life. It shaped my morals, it helped to instill into me the values that all life is sacred, to never judge by appearances, that knowledge and strength are useless if not destructive if you've not the respect or discipline to wield them. That what can seem to be a bloodthirsty enemy could just be someone scared, lashing out, and they just need a proper avenue to understand and learn. That protecting the masses means ensuring the smallest of us have all of their rights and dignities intact.

My perfect future would be one akin to what the Federation has accomplished. I truly feel the era of a United Earth is closer now than ever before, but we must take measures to ensure our equality and fairness. I shudder to think of a world where the Replicator has become a commonplace item, but for greedy purposes it is restricted (Think about how Electric Cars have all but been shot in the kneecap because Oil Companies need their profits). I base my political decisions and votes on a simple metric: ""Will this help to push us down the path of Star Trek's future?"" 

I don't think Star Trek is some magical gospel, but I do feel that people pick up their morals from the content they have absorbed over their lifetime (be it sports, human interactions, or television/videogames/books). In the end it is not necessarily the work itself but rather what you get out of that work. Harry Potter for example is a series undergoing a critical self-look by the fandom, finding many troublesome things within the work (House Elves being ""happy slaves"" just does not sit well for many) but it is indisputable that many people were able to form their morals from the series, morals such as: Friendship is worth more than power, Love is a stronger force than anyone knows, it is better to die protecting someone than to live only for yourself. 

And that's what I keep coming back to. Yeah, there are a lot of wacky adventures and somethings that, despite apparently happening 500 years from now, are downright dated. But again and again I find myself looking at this fictional universe and thinking ""How can we bring ourselves to be closer to that?""

0,"Remember ""Star Trek Into Darkness""? Khan transported to the Klingon home world from Earth (Alpha to Beta quadrant). If that tech really existed in that time, then why couldn't they build something like that in the 32nd century?

Remember those transporters in ""Star Trek Picard""? The ones at Starfleet headquarters, where you can simply walk through and then materialize somewhere else. Combine the distance of the Khan transporter and those ""walk-in transporters"", and you have stargates. No need for warp anymore. Just walk to another planet in another quadrant, daisy chain those transport hubs and you can go anywhere in the galaxy by walking 100 meters...

The Federation can then live on and expand. Especially since personal transporters are a thing, probably for short range, but that means that the energy efficiency of transporters is super high in the 32nd century. So maybe they can even build stargates for starships in orbit. Again, no need for warp anymore.

The few ships with warp can then position the stargates in orbit of member planets and rebuild the Federation.

They really messed up Star Trek with those ""creative"" ideas about tech. It ruins the plots.","Why don't they use the transporter of ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" to transport to different planets in the 32nd century?",remember  star trek into darkness   khan transported to the klingon home world from earth  alpha to beta quadrant   if that tech really existed in that time  then why couldn t they build something like that in the 32nd century remember those transporters in  star trek picard   the ones at starfleet headquarters  where you can simply walk through and then materialize somewhere else  combine the distance of the khan transporter and those  walk in transporters   and you have stargates  no need for warp anymore  just walk to another planet in another quadrant  daisy chain those transport hubs and you can go anywhere in the galaxy by walking 100 meters   the federation can then live on and expand  especially since personal transporters are a thing  probably for short range  but that means that the energy efficiency of transporters is super high in the 32nd century  so maybe they can even build stargates for starships in orbit  again  no need for warp anymore the few ships with warp can then position the stargates in orbit of member planets and rebuild the federation they really messed up star trek with those  creative  ideas about tech  it ruins the plots why don t they use the transporter of  star trek into darkness  to transport to different planets in the 32nd century

0,"I'm rewatching from where I left off in the 90s: Season 3.

What's interesting is that I can say that this is a totally ""CW"" show. Even Enterprise was more ""Berman"" than this. This is weirdly, totally ""CW"".

I've seen all of TNG and DS9 and as a pair they are core Trek. DS9 is, at its peak, Peak Trek. I never saw season 3, but I've watch 1&amp;2 and a few episodes of ""4"" (TAS) and all of ""5"" (STC) of TOS. 

I consider the TOS films to be core, the TNG films to be in that realm of ""meh, okay, lame, but meh"" category of 90s films which the Brosnan Bonds occupy.

JJ Trek is alright, but very different. CBS Trek, all the way around, is garbage. For bad world building, bad plot, weird acting, awful writing, cheap sets.

But Voyager? Honestly, it went on so long, and is so very different. It ""looks"" like TNG/DS9 Trek. As I said, Enterprise had bits of its ""90s TV"" style, but Enterprise was more Berman-esque, mostly in the vein of the TNG films. The fourth season was very good and focused almost into the DS9 realm.

Voyager?

This IS, as I said, CW Trek.

But I love it.

It takes cheap, cheezy, pedestrian character drama that the other Treks in spite of themselves did NOT have, and elevates it. It takes ""CW"" and elevates it to a very respectful ""Star Trek"" level of style, lore and form. It therefore produces almost like an enlightened version of what you'd see in ""Xena Warrior Princess"". It's schlocky, but sincere, intellectual, and worships the legacy of Star Trek.

It's not DS9 or TNG. It's its own thing. But somehow it's just really great in its own way. It's proof that Trek can elevate things.

It proves why CBS Trek is so bad, because it belittles and lowers Trek (when Trek should automatically lift up genres, styles and properties).",Praise To Voyager,i m rewatching from where i left off in the 90s  season 3 what s interesting is that i can say that this is a totally  cw  show  even enterprise was more  berman  than this  this is weirdly  totally  cw  i ve seen all of tng and ds9 and as a pair they are core trek  ds9 is  at its peak  peak trek  i never saw season 3  but i ve watch 1 amp 2 and a few episodes of  4   tas  and all of  5   stc  of tos  i consider the tos films to be core  the tng films to be in that realm of  meh  okay  lame  but meh  category of 90s films which the brosnan bonds occupy jj trek is alright  but very different  cbs trek  all the way around  is garbage  for bad world building  bad plot  weird acting  awful writing  cheap sets but voyager  honestly  it went on so long  and is so very different  it  looks  like tng ds9 trek  as i said  enterprise had bits of its  90s tv  style  but enterprise was more berman esque  mostly in the vein of the tng films  the fourth season was very good and focused almost into the ds9 realm voyager this is  as i said  cw trek but i love it it takes cheap  cheezy  pedestrian character drama that the other treks in spite of themselves did not have  and elevates it  it takes  cw  and elevates it to a very respectful  star trek  level of style  lore and form  it therefore produces almost like an enlightened version of what you d see in  xena warrior princess   it s schlocky  but sincere  intellectual  and worships the legacy of star trek it s not ds9 or tng  it s its own thing  but somehow it s just really great in its own way  it s proof that trek can elevate things it proves why cbs trek is so bad  because it belittles and lowers trek  when trek should automatically lift up genres  styles and properties  praise to voyager

0,"I just watched DS9: A Man Alone. In the episode, a man kills a clone that he made of himself. It is stated that this makes him a murderer. Parallel Bashir ended up creating another clone because plot reasons, and at the end of the episode, they mentioned that this clone went off to start a new life for himself.

So the takeaway is: It's ok to clone people - no need to ask for permission, and killing clones is no different from killing people.

But then I remembered an episode of TNG: Up The Long Ladder. As I recall (it's been a while since I've seen it), DNA is taken from Riker and Polaski without their permission to make clones. When this is discovered, Riker destroys the clones. Riker faces no repercussions for this action, and nobody suggests there was anything wrong with it.

To be perfectly clear, I’ve seen my favorite episodes dozens of times each, and every episode at least once, but even with my favorite shows I don’t do a complete series overhaul very often.

Oh, I’ve always remained steadfast in my love of it sure, but it can be another thing entirely to remain *passionate* after a certain amount of time away has elapsed. The biggest takeaways were how much two episodes in particular grew on me: The Defector and Frame of Mind. I think because on my first watch through as a teen I never quite liked the Romulan centric stories as much as Klingon or even Cardassian ones (“They’re just unreasonable Vulcans” I might have said), and an episode like Frame of Mind was too out there for me back then I think. But they rose quite a bit in my esteem this time around.

**-The main cast are all incredible.** Yes the show is very much centered around SMG but she does an amazing job. Her speech in the latest episode easily rivals classic trek speeches. The rest of the cast is great too. Michel Yeoh steals every scene she's in. Her and Sonequa Martin-Green's scenes are always great. Doug Jones has vaulted into the pantheon of trek captains in only a handful of episodes. I love how Saru is Starfleet through and through while having a completly different style from any previous captain.   


\-**Every episode this season has been a banger.** Every one has been a classic \~30 min trek episode with the burn as an intriguing B plot. The seed vault and the Ni'Var episodes are easily top 50 trek episodes. Getting a deep dive in to barzan culture was refreshing given how many trek races are so one note. The misunderstood monster is a classic trek plot that was done really well. Watching that man suffer was legitimately heartbreaking. This latest episode was just a classic lawyer trek episode. It examined the consequence of a previous trek series without being overly fan servicy. 

**-the representation is awesome.** Its just awesome and is something trek should've done ages ago. 

\-**the ships and uniforms are awesome**. When I first watched discovery I hated the uniforms and the angular ships but now I really like them. The 31st century uniforms are similarly awesome and both compete with the TNG movies/lateDS9 uniforms for my favorite.

WTH? Do they have postal service that visits the ships? (I know, it's a rhetorical question) I wonder if the writers gave it a thought on how that would work, the Enterprise is in the middle of a mission, away from any base, that's what made me think.

If I was asked to give an ""in universe"" explanation, I would say: People scan whatever physical object they want to send, and it's translated and sent as data to the bases or starships and then, the replicators use this data to re-create those physical objects.

Did anyone else's eyes roll back to their occipital lobe when after traveling 1000 years into the future, where everything we see should be new and amazing and imaginative, that like the 5th major character we meet is ... drumroll ... the main character's mom?

For me, this is one of those amazing ST gaffes, like 'brain and brain', Uhura's ST5 fan dance, or the horrible 'KHAN!!' yell in STID.  Not just a clunky moment but something that pulls me completely away from the show and makes me think, 'What the heck is going on?? What are they thinking?'  

I'm a fan from way back and root for Trek and want it to do well.  I've looked forward to new and interesting takes on ST when TNG and its successors were new, when JJ Trek was coming, and now CBS Trek.  But I can't shake the feeling that the creatives now in charge just don't know what they're doing, and don't have the imagination to tell new and interesting stories that scratch that ST itch.  The exception here is Lower Decks, which despite a bit of obnoxiousness at the start, has really developed into something with a lot of creativity and a unique voice. 

I realize opinions may differ, and that's fine, but I really wonder:  when you saw Mom pull back that cloak, did that really work for you?

0,"**Spoiler alert:** the material below spoils character information revealed in the first half-dozen episodes of *Star Trek: Discovery*, season 3.

If you’ve not watched these episodes, intend to do so, and don’t want to be spoiled, don’t read further in to this post.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

1. **Micheal Burnham and Cleveland Booker**

   A Black man (Booker) and Black woman (Burnham), and not one of the
   problems or challenges they face as people or as a couple is
   because they are Black.

   Just as important: there is no hint that their phenotypes could be
   the cause of a problem or challenge. (It doesn’t hurt that neither
   ‘Book’ nor Burnham have, so far, been saddled with any ‘Blackness
   as character marker’ tropes. At least so far as my not-American and
   English-is-not-my-first-languge head has spotted.)

   Want me to believe in a-little-bit-utopian imagined Star Trek
   future? This is absolutely one of the necessary things, for me.
   Because, without Black people (and not-White people in general)
   living as ‘just people’ being utterly normal, I’m not going to buy
   your imagined better future.

   Futures made up only of people who all look
   Northern-European–descended aren’t utopias, they are the aftermaths
   of genocide.

   Put another away, SF has to normalise Black people (and not-White
   people, more generally) living as unhyphenated humans. Black people
   not being defined as ‘African-American people’, or as ‘Black
   people’. Rather, they are ‘people’, living with the same
   opportunities, and the same constraints, and the same hopes, and
   the same fears, as every other person.

   This is not the same thing as so-called ‘colour-blind’ writing,
   which tends to turn everyone in to ‘generic White’.

   Differences don’t go away, they just stop acting as limitations, or
   barriers, or character markers.

   That latter point is a big one, BTW. ‘Sassy Black Woman’, for
   example, is not a character marker. It’s a racist trope that hides
   the trauma and exhausted and constant defence of self underlying
   the actual behaviours the trope appropriates.

2. **Adira Tal** and **Gray Tal**

   A woman (Adira) and a man (Gray) in a mixed-gender queer
   relationship, and the mixed-gender aspect isn’t used to argue the
   pair are ‘actually’ or ‘basically’ straight.

   Bisexual folk make up about 50% of all GSM folk. And about 80% of
   bisexual people are in mixed-gender relationships.

   My own, bisexual-centric, friends-and-family, circle, has a higher
   percentage of bisexual-folk in same-gender relationships than the
   world-wide average. But there are still multiple mixed-gender queer
   relationships in my circle. And their being mixed-gender doesn’t
   make them less queer.

   A *lot* of queer relationships are mixed-gender. But narratives
   that manage to acknowledge this, let alone actively show this, are
   not exactly common.

   So, even though this particular relationship is full of SFnal
   tropery (Gray isn’t human; and now he’s dead and only visible to
   Adira), I’ll take this one as a start. Better than nothing. Because
   nothing is, all-too-often, the only alternative on offer.

   It helps that both of them are cute as hell and manage to show
   ‘young love’ without being over-the-top with the adolescent drama
   (not because over-the-top adolescent drama is a bad thing, per se,
   but because it makes this particular representation all the more
   positive and delightful to watch).","Two relationships I particularly like in *Star Trek: Discovery*, season 3",  spoiler alert    the material below spoils character information revealed in the first half dozen episodes of  star trek  discovery   season 3 if you ve not watched these episodes  intend to do so  and don t want to be spoiled  don t read further in to this post  amp nbsp  amp nbsp 1    micheal burnham and cleveland booker     a black man  booker  and black woman  burnham   and not one of the   problems or challenges they face as people or as a couple is   because they are black    just as important  there is no hint that their phenotypes could be   the cause of a problem or challenge   it doesn t hurt that neither    book  nor burnham have  so far  been saddled with any  blackness   as character marker  tropes  at least so far as my not american and   english is not my first languge head has spotted     want me to believe in a little bit utopian imagined star trek   future  this is absolutely one of the necessary things  for me    because  without black people  and not white people in general    living as  just people  being utterly normal  i m not going to buy   your imagined better future    futures made up only of people who all look   northern european descended aren t utopias  they are the aftermaths   of genocide    put another away  sf has to normalise black people  and not white   people  more generally  living as unhyphenated humans  black people   not being defined as  african american people   or as  black   people   rather  they are  people   living with the same   opportunities  and the same constraints  and the same hopes  and   the same fears  as every other person    this is not the same thing as so called  colour blind  writing    which tends to turn everyone in to  generic white     differences don t go away  they just stop acting as limitations  or   barriers  or character markers    that latter point is a big one  btw   sassy black woman   for   example  is not a character marker  it s a racist trope that hides   the trauma and exhausted and constant defence of self underlying   the actual behaviours the trope appropriates 2    adira tal   and   gray tal     a woman  adira  and a man  gray  in a mixed gender queer   relationship  and the mixed gender aspect isn t used to argue the   pair are  actually  or  basically  straight    bisexual folk make up about 50  of all gsm folk  and about 80  of   bisexual people are in mixed gender relationships    my own  bisexual centric  friends and family  circle  has a higher   percentage of bisexual folk in same gender relationships than the   world wide average  but there are still multiple mixed gender queer   relationships in my circle  and their being mixed gender doesn t   make them less queer    a  lot  of queer relationships are mixed gender  but narratives   that manage to acknowledge this  let alone actively show this  are   not exactly common    so  even though this particular relationship is full of sfnal   tropery  gray isn t human  and now he s dead and only visible to   adira   i ll take this one as a start  better than nothing  because   nothing is  all too often  the only alternative on offer    it helps that both of them are cute as hell and manage to show    young love  without being over the top with the adolescent drama    not because over the top adolescent drama is a bad thing  per se    but because it makes this particular representation all the more   positive and delightful to watch  two relationships i particularly like in  star trek  discovery   season 3

0,"# Preface:

I love, love, love DS9 as it was written and produced. These thoughts are not meant to disparage the show at all; it's simply musings about what else could have been.

Avery Brooks played a great Commander and Captain. The nuance he brought to the character was amazing.

I am well aware that Cmdr. Riker wanted the Enterprise. I also feel that, of all the characters on TNG, his character development was done the least-- not to say it wasn't done at all. But I think his character would have really blossomed on DS9. With that, we'll begin the musings:

# Riker's Charisma and Back-Alley Persona

For the developments that did happen with Cmdr. Riker, we got to see just slight glimpses of the wheeling-and-dealing that he could do. We also got to witness how intimidating he can get [on a few different occasions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEWKAVvH0QY) We've also seen how he had rapport with Quark. He's also shown how he can play dirty-- and this would have all been effective at DS9.

Cmdr. Sisko embodies a lot of those qualities, especially later on. And I think Cmdr. Riker being driven to some desperation would have been a great evolution of his character. I could absolutely see Riker truly losing it and saying, ""Major! Shut that thing off!"" as an example. Riker needing to tap into that side of his would have been instrumental during the Dominion War, and he would have had ample time to consider or regret what he was becoming.

# Getting Cmdr. Riker to relinquish the Enterprise via writing

As I had mentioned in the preface, Cmdr. Riker was adamant about having command of the Enterprise. It was a taste that was difficult to dismiss when he had command on a few occasions, particularly when they engaged the Borg. So the opening of Deep Space Nine would have needed to have the wormhole already recently discovered by the time the first episode lands, and the outpost seeking a capable commander. Enter William T. Riker.

# The Enticing Dynamics between Riker and the other DS9 characters

I think the only real dynamic that may be sacrificed in this scenario is the one between Jadzia and Benjamin. One of my favorite utterances throughout DS9 is the use of, ""old man."" Outside of that, I could absolutely see Riker and every character aboard DS9 having a great dynamic, and still be very similar to how Sisko's dynamics worked out. Many ideas pop into mind here.

# The Arrival of Worf

I could imagine how much the Trek fandom freaked out when Worf returned to Star Trek. I wasn't connected with them at the time, but seeing him appear made me scream out of excitement as a kid. I think the dynamic between Riker and Worf was already fantastic (""Besides... you look good in a dress.""). The further deepening of the dynamic would have been great for both of them.

I can think of many other points, but I'll save them from this already huge wall of text. I'll let you all ponder it, too.",I wonder often about what would have happened if Cmdr.
