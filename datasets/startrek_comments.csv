ENT doesn't have a great deal of philosophical depth, which seems to be an objective marker for a lack of quality--especially for Star Trek. It also has a limited set of characters some of whom are really quite mundane. 

But I'd argue it does have some strength in plot and a couple of strong characters. Namely Archer, T'Pol, Tucker and Phlox. Oh and Porthos, of course.

The thing I like most about ENT is that it does a good job of depicting starfleet in its adolescence. The combination of exploration and flailing about in uncertainty strikes a chord with the way humans behave in new situations.

Star Trek has also shown that being second in command comes with a long list of management which an Ensign will have no experience in. Crew evaluations, organising shift rotations, disciplining crew memebers, training crew members, running training exercises. All things Riker did in TNG. Kira did similar stuff in DS9.

The power core of the catapult generated a massive graviton surge that locked onto a ship through an array of projectors. The surge sent the ship hurtling into null space for some hours. Upon emerging back to normal space, the vessel had jumped many hundreds or even thousands of light years. The distance was determined by the graviton field strength.

Their crew had built such a device as a means of getting home in a shorter period of time than by warp drive. The first test had destabilized the tetryon reactions of the tetryon reactor used as the power core, causing it to leak bursts of epsilon radiation. Voyager used graviton pulses fired from the deflector dish to stabilize the reactions.

They got 30 sectors / 3 years journey-time out out of 1 jump.

What are you talking about dude? You brought up their conversation in defense of Tuvix being murdered. I'm saying it isn't applicable lol

&gt;Of course they're still alive, that's why I mentioned denying them sleep lol.

Which doesn't work as an analogy. Try a different one lol

&gt;I don't think you understand because that's the scenario we have in the episode lol.

It literally isn't lol

&gt;Tuvok and Neelix were still dead until Janeway brought them back, so until then the emergency was still in full swing lol. Plus, that's not a different scenario, that's the same scenario because it's the same emergency as before lol.

Wrong again lol There is no emergency except in your mind. You're making this argument based on the Troi/Riker conversation: that was about choosing between two living people, not choosing to actively murder someone in order to resurrect someone else. lol

&gt;You forgot the other part, whether to murder two innocent people to keep one person alive lol.

But they weren't being murdered, they were already dead. Do you know what the word ""murder"" means? I don't think you do lol

&gt;Nope, it's kill one person or two people, only one philosophy needed because it's one scenario lol. Unless you think it's a different scenario because like I said before you seem to think that sleeping people deserve consciousness but you seem to think dead people don't deserve life lol. Like I said before lol, why the difference?

Man I don't even know where to start with this. The difference is because sleeping people aren't dead. Why do you keep using an analogy that doesn't work lol? And no, it's not actively killing two people: they died in an accident and it's not Tuvix's fault. 

&gt;You think Star Trek has always been about killing two people to save one? I don't think you understand Star Trek lol.

At this point I think you're just being willfully ignorant or pretending to be retarded to misinterpret what I said this much kek

&gt;Two people were dead and would continue to stay dead unless someone did something about it. If that's not an emergency I don't know what is lol. Life was about as far from normal as you could get for Tuvok and Neelix lol. Kes and Janeway missing their friends is also a symptom of life not being back to normal, even you admit that so you're contradicting yourself on life being normal lol.

Because being dead isn't an emergency. It's what happens after the emergency. 

&gt; You yourself said that ""death changes things"" again without giving proof lol. Where's your proof? 

You want proof that being dead is different to being asleep? Man.

&gt; I guess you think Lyndsay Ballard shouldn't have been resurrected because according to you the dead don't deserve life lol. 

If I had to murder an innocent man to do it, then no she shouldn't be resurrected. 

&gt; I'd like to see what you say about resurrecting your friend Tuvix after the episode, what excuse you make for going against your argument that the dead should stay dead lol.

While I wouldn't want Tuvix to be murdered in the first place, going ahead and murdering Tuvok and Neelix in some hypothetical situation to bring Tuvix back to life would also be wrong. How are you not understanding this?

&gt;It's not an analogy lol. Most people get that stealing is immoral lol. The Federation gets it too lol.

So what's that got to do with the current discussion? lol

&gt;The values are the same about this, the Federation thinks stealing is wrong too lol. It's not my opinion, it's a value that lots of people get, including the Federation lol.

Okay, whats your point lol

&gt;If it has noting to do with Janeway then why did you bring it up lol? You said you would follow a person, Picard, rather than what's right, I'm showing you why that's a bad philosophy lol.

I literally didn't say that lol you're running out of arguments again so you're reducing yourself to strawman arguments. 

&gt;Nope, the core of the debate is whether it's right or not lol. You do get my comment about ""the most Federation way ever"" was a joke and meant that it was the right thing to do, right? Because that should have been obvious lol.

No, it was about it being the most Federation way ever, which is why I disputed that it was in line with Federation values. Come on man, at least stay on topic lol

&gt;You also argue, without proof lol, that Federation values are against killing Tuvix, an assertion I've already disproven with the stuff about Riker and Troi lol.

Lmao you are brain damaged. The Riker/Troi conversation is a situation that is not applicable. So no, you haven't proven anything. But if you want a quote that suits protecting Tuvix as ""proof"", then how about, ""Starfleet was founded to seek out new life: well, there it sits!"" - Picard, when defending Data's right to exist. That is a more similar comparison to Tuvix than the Riker/Troi thing

&gt;Wrong on at least two counts lol. I already disproved this idea about my ""words"", so see above lol. Also, a ""way"" is referring to actions not values lol.

Shifting the goal posts I see. Let's face it, you know that what Janeway did goes against Federation values completely, so now you're trying to say the ""Federation way"" and ""Federation values"" are different (even though your argument with the Riker/Troi convo was to try to state what their values are, but you even got that wrong).

I agree about O‘Brien, though, who was definitely technically treated as a main character but didn‘t get much love from the writers in TNG. That was partially a sign of the times, of course. Both O‘Brien and Worf really shone on DS9, and I can only dream of what could have been if other characters such as Beverly Crusher, Deanna Troi or Geordi La Forge had been introduced to DS9 and been given some better-quality character development.

As for Discover‘s bridge crew, they kind of all blend into one generic personality for me, with the exception of Dettmer‘s fleeting moments of „look I have PTSD“.

If you think the values aren't applicable then why did you bring them up? lol

&gt; But your analogy doesn't work for the very fact that sleeping people are still alive. 

Of course they're still alive, that's why I mentioned denying them sleep lol.

&gt; Yes, because I don't think you're understanding the difference between these two scenarios. In one there is an emergency where some people have to be sacrificed to save others.

I don't think you understand because that's the scenario we have in the episode lol.

&gt; In the other the emergency has ended and two people died. 

Tuvok and Neelix were still dead until Janeway brought them back, so until then the emergency was still in full swing lol. Plus, that's not a different scenario, that's the same scenario because it's the same emergency as before lol.

&gt; The question is whether to murder one innocent person to resurrect two others.

You forgot the other part, whether to murder two innocent people to keep one person alive lol.

&gt; I know why you want to compare them, but surely you can see why they are different scenarios that require different philosophies?

Nope, it's kill one person or two people, only one philosophy needed because it's one scenario lol. Unless you think it's a different scenario because like I said before you seem to think that sleeping people deserve consciousness but you seem to think dead people don't deserve life lol. Like I said before lol, why the difference?

&gt; After all, that's what ST has always been about.

You think Star Trek has always been about killing two people to save one? I don't think you understand Star Trek lol.

&gt; Wrong. Go back and rewatch the episode: the emergency had ended. People being dead doesn't constitute an emergency. Life on Voyager got back to normal. It's just that Kes and Janeway decided they miss their friends. 

Two people were dead and would continue to stay dead unless someone did something about it. If that's not an emergency I don't know what is lol. Life was about as far from normal as you could get for Tuvok and Neelix lol. Kes and Janeway missing their friends is also a symptom of life not being back to normal, even you admit that so you're contradicting yourself on life being normal lol.

&gt; Holy cow man, you're really missing the point (not to mention trying salvage this analogy). No, they're not comparable, because death changes things. Being dead isn't the same as being asleep, and it's different enough to make this analogy fall down. 

Of course being dead is different than being asleep lol. The point of the analogy is why do you think the asleep deserve consciousness but the dead don't deserve life? You yourself said that ""death changes things"" again without giving proof lol. Where's your proof? I guess you think Lyndsay Ballard shouldn't have been resurrected because according to you the dead don't deserve life lol. I'd like to see what you say about resurrecting your friend Tuvix after the episode, what excuse you make for going against your argument that the dead should stay dead lol.

&gt; See above. Different scenario, not applicable. 

See above. Same scenario lol. If you think it's the different scenarios then why did you bring up Federation values? lol

&gt; What? Mate, if you want your analogies to make sense you have to think them through. Stealing under what conditions?

It's not an analogy lol. Most people get that stealing is immoral lol. The Federation gets it too lol.

&gt; What's that got to do with Tuvix?

If you don't think it has anything to do with Tuvix then why did you bring it up? lol

&gt; Either way, absolute morality and Federation values aren't the same. Federation values are made by fallible people: so whether or not stealing (???) is right or wrong in your opinion is irrelevant

The values are the same about this, the Federation thinks stealing is wrong too lol. It's not my opinion, it's a value that lots of people get, including the Federation lol.

&gt; I'm starting to think you're either a troll for misrepresenting my views, or you're just really bad at debating because I never said that. I think Picard was right to shoot Lynch; that has nothing to do with Janeway. 

If it has noting to do with Janeway then why did you bring it up lol? You said you would follow a person, Picard, rather than what's right, I'm showing you why that's a bad philosophy lol.

&gt; No, the core of the debate (which you said yourself) is whether Janeway dealt with it in ""the most Federation way ever."" That's separate to whether you personally believe it was the right thing. 

Nope, the core of the debate is whether it's right or not lol. You do get my comment about ""the most Federation way ever"" was a joke and meant that it was the right thing to do, right? Because that should have been obvious lol.

&gt; Again, you're just trolling at this point, or failing at comprehension of what I'm saying. Picard embodies Federation values almost to the point of personification: which is why he wouldn't have murdered Tuvix. That's all I'm saying. 

Again, you're saying these things without proof lol. You say Picard embodies Federation values, without proof I might add, and I assume the idea that the Federation values are the right values is implied (again without proof lol). You also argue, without proof lol, that Federation values are against killing Tuvix, an assertion I've already disproven with the stuff about Riker and Troi lol. Any proof you want to bring up to defend your assertions, because otherwise you'd by default have to concede they're not true lol.

&gt; Literally wrong. Again, ""Tuvix was dealt with the most Federation way ever...."" in your words. Unless you think the Federation ""way"" is different to Federation values?

Wrong on at least two counts lol. I already disproved this idea about my ""words"", so see above lol. Also, a ""way"" is referring to actions not values lol.

&gt; Proof of what, exactly? What they're saying? Go and watch the episodes again lol. It'll take you 80 mins max. Less if you cut out the TNG ep and just watch the scene with Riker and Troi.

what's worse is they all rely heavily imo on rehashing stuff instead of coming up with new ideas. it's kirk and spock, again! but with lens flare. it's another prequel and she's spock's secret sister! etc etc. again, in the sense of fairness, that all might just be shitty executives meddling with the production. there's no way for us to know

and again in the sense of fairness to discovery, it's gotten better every season. but in 2020 it shouldn't take 3 seasons for a show to become watchable. if this was any other franchise it would have been cancelled

I know that this has been a classic aspect of Star Trek since all the way back to Charlie X and the likes, but it‘s never been my favourite. The Guardian of Forever in Discovery felt like I was watching Doctor Who. (And when I‘m in the mood for Doctor Who, I go watch Doctor Who...)

It's an uncomplicated show inspired by the same Western, Samurai and Flash Gordon-esque sources that inspired George Lucas in his day. 

Similarly, the original Star Trek was basically inspired by the golden era of sci-fi short stories and novels (and many scripts were written by authors of that era), and Twilight Zone style story of the week storytelling where the plot is basically: 'something weird happens, and at the end of the episode we can reflect back on what lessons we take away from this experience'. 

Sometimes simpler is better. They need to pull the stakes back. The entire universe doesn't need to be at stake every season. That works for Marvel tentpole films and Doctor Who, which are both more space wizardry than sci-fi. 

Something like 'Charlie X' is so quaint and lovable in comparison to all the new stuff. I sometimes think a low budget would help the franchise by forcing writers to focus on writing simpler, more engaging stories you can film on your starship set and your alien planet soundstage made of foam rubber rocks and a green sky. That's really what made Star Trek so good from the beginning. The stories overcame the fact that the starship is made of plywood [and the alien critter is a dog in a fur coat with rubber horn on his head](https://imagecdn.heroesandiconstv.com/FZ1JG-1485549402-embed-enemy3.jpg).

[],,TheGodBen,,,[],,,,text,t2_6w0uu,False,False,[],"**Discovery:** This is the most frustrating to me because it has the most potential to be good out of the three shows, but the writing consistently fails it. Discovery presents a lot of interesting ideas, but the writers are either incapable or disinterested in developing each idea appropriately before dumping it or shoving it into the background so they can introduce some new idea to the mix. The result is a show filled with action and emotional climaxes that feel totally unearned because the groundwork wasn't done to make those moments actually mean anything to me as a viewer.

And to make matters worse, the writers keep twisting the plots so that Michael, the least interesting cast-member, can be at the centre of it all. The lengths they have gone to have her involved in each episode are comical at times. The experiment of having a Star Trek show where the lead character isn't the captain figure has been a total failure so far. It has hurt the overall narrative of each season, it has hurt the episodic plots by trying to jam her into stories she doesn't belong in, it has hurt the other cast members due to their reduced screen-time, and it has hurt Michael herself due to over-exposure breeding contempt.

**Picard:** The worst of the three so far. A jumbled mess of ideas that completely failed to come together into a cohesive narrative, filled with ridiculous clichés that were supposed to make the show ""gritty"", and which descended into absolute farce by the finale. And sadly, the Picard in Picard is no longer the Picard I admired from TNG. This is what happens when you give Patrick Stewart too much creative control over the character, he tries to twist the character into a Mary Sue of himself.

The difference between Discovery and Picard to me is that I believe that Discovery is salvageable if only the show had a writing staff that was capable and willing to put the work in to make it a great show. Whereas Picard was so poorly executed in its first season that I seriously doubt there's anything that could be done to fix it.

**Lower Decks:** This is going to be the most subjective of the three because that's the nature of comedy. Personally, I didn't find the show funny, nor even amusing. What's worse, I found the character of Mariner extremely obnoxious, which made the show a chore to watch most weeks. It's actually the best written of the shows on a structural level, and it's kinda bizarre that it's the comedy show that knows how to structure plots better than the drama shows considering how that aspect of storytelling is a lot less important in comedy than in drama. 

Basically, I don't like what Lower Decks is or what it's trying to be, but that's just due to my completely subjective tastes.

Proof of what? Riker telling Troi that *is* Federation values. What I'm saying is that you're misuing their conversation: their values aren't applicable to the Tuvix situation

&gt;I didn't say it was the same thing, I said there were similarities lol. The major one being saying the dead don't deserve life and saying the asleep don't deserve consciousness are both illogical lol.

But your analogy doesn't work for the very fact that sleeping people are still alive. 

&gt;Like killing holo-LaForge isn't murdering him but a utilitarian decision, riiiight lol. Because it's a utilitarian decision it's totally different from the utilitarian decision to kill Tuvix, riiiiight lol.

Yes, because I don't think you're understanding the difference between these two scenarios. In one there is an emergency where some people have to be sacrificed to save others. In the other the emergency has ended and two people died. The question is whether to murder one innocent person to resurrect two others. I know why you _want_ to compare them, but surely you can see why they are different scenarios that require different philosophies? After all, that's what ST has always been about. 

&gt;Tuvok and Neelix were still dead, sounds like the emergency was still in full swing lol.

Wrong. Go back and rewatch the episode: the emergency had ended. People being dead doesn't constitute an emergency. Life on Voyager got back to normal. It's just that Kes and Janeway decided they miss their friends. 

&gt;Right like denying someone consciousness and denying someone life is totally not comparable at all, riiiiight lol.

Holy cow man, you're really missing the point (not to mention trying salvage this analogy). No, they're not comparable, because death changes things. Being dead isn't the same as being asleep, and it's different enough to make this analogy fall down.  

&gt;What do you think I was saying with Riker and Troi? lol

See above. Different scenario, not applicable. 

&gt;So whether stealing vs not stealing is the right thing is subjective and up for debate, riiight lol.

What? Mate, if you want your analogies to make sense you have to think them through. Stealing under what conditions? What's that got to do with Tuvix? Either way, absolute morality and Federation values aren't the same. Federation values are made by fallible people: so whether or not stealing (???) is right or wrong _in your opinion_ is irrelevant

&gt;So just becuase you disagree with Janeway you'd do whatever Picard does? You'd shoot up Ensign Lynch so that he looks like swiss cheese just because you disagree with Janeway? lol

I'm starting to think you're either a troll for misrepresenting my views, or you're just really bad at debating because I never said that. I think Picard was right to shoot Lynch; that has nothing to do with Janeway. 

&gt;Whether Janeway did the right thing in killing Tuvix is the core of the debate, unless you think we're arguing about Troi and Riker? lol

No, the core of the debate (which you said yourself) is whether Janeway dealt with it in ""the most Federation way ever."" That's separate to whether you personally believe it was the right thing. 

&gt;I was talking about Picard's values since you brought it up, not Tuvix lol. Keep up lol. You seem to not want to talk about Tuvix anyway since you said this isn't about Tuvix, so I think you'd welcome talking about Picard lol.

Again, you're just trolling at this point, or failing at comprehension of what I'm saying. Picard embodies Federation values almost to the point of personification: which is why he wouldn't have murdered Tuvix. That's all I'm saying. 

&gt;You're the one who brought up Federation values not me lol. Keep up lol.

Literally wrong. Again, ""Tuvix was dealt with the most Federation way ever...."" in your words. Unless you think the Federation ""way"" is different to Federation values?

&gt;Again, proof? Blustery claims about how something is wrong isn't proof lol.

The show is no longer willing to push back and make waves because those in charge are fully on board with profit first to line their own pockets. The two don't have to be mutually exclusive, but you have to be willing to put your neck on the line to push the envelope. 

The idea that Trek needs to be modernised is a fallacy to me, what they mean is that Trek needs to make loads of money and provide lots of merch to consume because that's the way a large portion of the viewers now engage with entertainment. Its less about content and more about the ""Universe"" and all its associated interconnected media. And its often at the expense of consistent quality. 

Kurtzman is a J.J acolyte and I'm reminded of a J.J interview from a few years back when he made '09:

""Star Trek, always felt like a silly, campy thing. I remember appreciating it, but feeling like I didn't get it. I felt it didn't give me a way in. There was a captain, there was this first officer, they were talking a lot about adventures and not having them as much as I would've liked. Maybe I wasn't smart enough, maybe I wasn't old enough. But The Twilight Zone I was obsessed with. Loved it.

...I had no idea there had been 10 movies! I still haven't seen them all. I didn't want to become a student of Star Trek. I felt that was actually one of the few advantages I had. I was trying to make a movie, not trying to make a Trek movie."" 


The problem is that you can't ignore past Trek when making new Trek because its an idea rather than a finished product. If you don't get that then you're wasting _my_ time as a consumer, your product is not what you advertised to me.

J.J and cronies basically said ""we don't understand this thing, and we're not interested in trying because its easier and more profitable to us to just rebrand our current product and sell you that instead"".

And I'm supposed to tow the line and buy the merch because its branded Star Trek. 

The new shows have a lot of good things that can be said of them, but it's all for naught with the current execution as its becoming clearer that what they're aiming for is always going to be safely vanilla. And in the era of social justice and change I expected more than this from Trek.

Many criticisms, my latest being how, despite the low episode count, in both series it seems to take an absolute age for the main plot line to move on. The episodes are stuffed full of tangential, meandering subplots, which at the conclusion I'm left wondering what was the point?

Picard, for example, took *so long* to get a crew together and seemed to slowly visit a planet to get whatever small thing was required to move the plot along. Same for Discovery.

Season 3 of Discovery has been about finding the source of The Burn. But 11 episodes have been spent on side shows.  Seed ship plot, Adira is a Trill subplot, something happening on Brook's planet, waiting for algorithms to complete, stringing it out over multiple episodes only to interrupt it all with a Mirror Universe nonsense two-parter. None of it seems to matter, so why devote entire episodes of a short season to it? 

The entire Burn plot could have been done in a two-parter if they'd dispensed with the filler, but instead it's the whole season. So my latest gripe is basically that Picard and Discovery are actually padding out their short seasons with filler, because their season-long archs aren't actually any more ambitious or interesting than a traditional series two-parter.",,,1609676360,{},ghxy2oz,False,t3_kph4hc,False,True,t3_kph4hc,/r/startrek/comments/kph4hc/whats_your_opinions_on_the_newest_editions/ghxy2oz/,1609676372,1,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,,0,[],,

I didn't say it was the same thing, I said there were similarities lol. The major one being saying the dead don't deserve life and saying the asleep don't deserve consciousness are both illogical lol.

So whether stealing vs not stealing is the right thing is subjective and up for debate, riiight lol.

So just becuase you disagree with Janeway you'd do whatever Picard does? You'd shoot up Ensign Lynch so that he looks like swiss cheese just because you disagree with Janeway? lol

&gt; Again, totally different situation. They were being attacked. It’s not comparable to the thing with Tuvix. 

I was talking about Picard's values since you brought it up, not Tuvix lol. Keep up lol. You seem to not want to talk about Tuvix anyway since you said this isn't about Tuvix, so I think you'd welcome talking about Picard lol.

&gt; If your entire argument that her actions are in line with Federation values hinges on this conversation between Riker and Troi

You're the one who brought up Federation values not me lol. Keep up lol.

&gt; the meaning of which you’ve misinterpreted, then I think you need to go back and rewatch both that TNG episode and the Tuvix ep. Listen carefully to what Riker is saying and then rewatch Tuvix and see how what Janeway did was completely different.

That data is then stored in the pattern buffer and then sent to a new location where the data in the buffer is reassembled, atom by atom, back into their original positions. This ends up with an exact duplication of the object as it was at the time it was disassembled.

Regarding our conciousness remaining intact during this process, we exist within a reality made up of atoms. This process is more involved than say a brain transplant from one body to another.... But it is our brains that holds our conciousness. In theory, if you froze yourself at this very moment (pressed the pause button) and then took your brain, body and everything else, deconstructed it as it is at this very moment, and then did all of the above to relocate and assemble elsewhere.... Everything in your brain, the blood, electrodes, etc, would be put right back in their exact place, and then you're un-paused.

From your perspective, you wouldn't have noticed any of this happening (if you were frozen / paused at the time for deconstruction) and the only thing you'd realise is that your surroundings just changed.

Your conciousness should be right there along with your body when it's all said and done.

Earth to Vulcan in 2 minutes, Vulcan to Laurentian system takes long enough for Kirk to get into a spat with Spock, get summarily shot off the ship (TF!?) and crashland within kilometers of Old Spock AND Scotty on a planet that can't be more than a lightsecond away from Vulcan. Star Trek's always had issues with distance, but this took the cake.

	Time does the same, with the Narada showing up, killing George Kirk, then disappearing for twenty-five years to wait for Spock to catch up before laying into Vulcan. Sure, there's a deleted scene that covers the gap - somewhat and makes no sense - but scenes cut from a movie don't count as part of the movie.

	Careers do the same as well. A trouble cadet can now command a fresh off the line starship and be responsible for the lives of a thousand crewmembers - somehow none of whom apparently outrank him - and the scary arsenal that comes with it.

	Introduces us to the true universe-breaking extent of transwarp beaming, something that according to prime-Spock prime-Scott invented as well. We can now transport directly from Earth to Qo'noS... So, admiral Marcus... Why send the Enterprise? You have the transwarp beaming thingie? If it's broken, you've got Scotty. He can fix it. Or make another one. And you can beam your strike-team, or torpedoes, directly to Harrison's location? No? Rule of Cool requires we blow up super secret Section 31 to the point where it's hiding a massive monstershipbuilding facility right inside the Federation's capitol system? Cause we have to somehow get to the freaky friday deathscene? And then kill stakes forever by fixing death itself? Oh, alright. Well, at least we got to see doctor Marcus in her knickers. That was certainly universe-building.

""spaceships go pew pew pew""

but the first two films massively dialled up the power level to the point of madness, with Scotty beaming people wherever he damn well pleases, Phaser turrets that (admittedly with help from a black hole) shredded a 24th century Borg enhanced mining ship, cracking Transwarp Drive in the mid 23 hundreds which allowed travel to Kronos in hours, you get the idea.

this works on a visceral level, but as soon as you think about it, it seems utterly insane, and how the hell did Scotty beam himself into a reactor tank anyway?



they tried to explore this in Into Darkness, with Section 31 gearing up for armed conflict with The Klingons, and trying to militarize The Federation even further, but the film was saddled with a Khan plot that I thought distracted from the actual story it wanted to tell, about a Post 9/11, War on Terror era Federation struggling with it's own Military Industrial Complex.

and I've still got very little to meaningfully say about Beyond, despite seeing it 6 times.
Sulu has a husband, that's nice. we finally get actual Away Team action, cool. Idris Elba is pissed that Starfleet left him behind after the Romulan War (I think? what was Idris Elba's problem actually?)


we also get to trash The Enterprise, for the fourth time in as many films, but it's all good because we also replace it straight after.

speaking of that, what's with the need for little of consequence to carry over?
first Kirk dies and gets revived half an hour later, then the Enterprise blows up and we replace it in the same film.

Alternatively, if the fleet did have confidence in him but the Borg prioritized the Enterprise as a target because it was familiar, it could be devastating to morale. Imagine if they even re-assimilated Picard. It’d be a fucking nightmare to the fleet if it wasn’t going well because it could start to seem like Wolf 359 all over again.

Later on, Picard does clearly have unresolved issues in facing the Borg.

So if Hayes went out there with, say, 150 ships making the Enterprise’s armament a marginal difference to his total fleet strength, the complexity of Picard’s involvement would be an illogical risk to take.

Uh, such as? I’ve addressed your points (several times). What do you want proof of, exactly?

&gt;Again, what makes the dead less deserving of life than the living? That’s like saying the sleeping are less deserving of consciousness than the awake lol.

Dude, it’s two different situations. I don’t know how many times I need to say being dead isn’t the same as being asleep. Riker was talking about a utilitarian decision in an emergency to save lives, not murdering an innocent man to resurrect people when the emergency has already ended. Surely you must realise these aren’t comparable. 

&gt;	So you’d rather follow Picard than do the right thing? 

We’re talking about Federation values, not what you or I think are the right thing (which is subjective and up for debate). However while we’re on this, I think Janeway did the wrong thing: so yes, I’d follow Picard. Perhaps you would disagree and you think she did the right thing, but that’s a separate debate. 

&gt;	Picard shot Ensign Lynch so many times that he must have looked like swiss cheese, you want to do the same because most fans agree Picard best embodies the values of the Federation out of any other character?

Again, totally different situation. They were being attacked. It’s not comparable to the thing with Tuvix. 

&gt;	Again, did you hear what Riker said to Troi in her command test?

If your entire argument that her actions are in line with Federation values hinges on this conversation between Riker and Troi, the meaning of which you’ve misinterpreted, then I think you need to go back and rewatch both that TNG episode and the Tuvix ep.

Most criticisms that still hold today are generic things about reboots, film criticism, action over substance, etc, even though most Star Trek movies are less ""deep"" than episodes.

At the time, the biggest issue was rebooting it while claiming that it wasn't, or avoiding the issue altogether. They were telling us it's Star Trek but it's obviously not the look and characters we know.

Luckily the explanations that came after about an alternate timeline do make sense and seem to fit *almost* exactly what we were provided on screen, so maybe it was always planned respectfully enough, but they chose to lie or be evasive instead of just say this from the beginning, which would have easily kept the fan base together (enough).

there's even a scene from either the first or second movie that shows the original Enterprise hanging over I think an admiral's desk, which would have made even clearer how the timeline changed with the arrival of the Narada, but yet again, some smart guy decided those two seconds weren't worth it and cut it out the final movie. You can find the clip on YouTube though.

So now that everything's out and clear, there's no problem with whether or not it's canon and stuff. Sadly, it apparently set a precedent for how you can attract a new audience while not caring about or even lying to the old fans, and Kurtzman jumped on that for Discovery and Picard, unashamedly lying it's the real, prime timeline Star Trek, or even directly saying in interviews he didn't like Star Trek as we knew it and wants to make it his thing - though the old knowledgeable fans can tell just from watching it.

Maybe. Or maybe save enough innocents so there isn’t a destroyed planet left behind.

One of the best Prime Directive episodes is Who Watches the Watchers because it shows the danger of pre-warp contact and why violating the prime directive is inherently dangerous.
As Asimov states: “any sufficiently advanced technology will seem as magic” to an in developed culture. As such the Metinkans begin to worship Picard. He does the right thing and tells them not to, but the damage is already done. Now this species knows about aliens, and are contaminated.

Think of North America before European contact, or Australia, or hundreds of other cultures that were wiped out because they had resources or something another group lived on.
Those cultures are lost or nearly lost because there was no respect for culture.
The federation wants there to be different cultures that exist to learn from. They don’t want a culture that says: yeah we put all our resources into learning about space travel because one day the Picard, who isn’t a god, but some people thought (and some still think) so, and now we are here to join your federation. We just wanted to get here. We really didn’t learn anything on the way.

There is no value in that. Maybe economic value, but that is not what the Federation wants. And not what the values of the Prime Directive are based on.

It is hard to look at a civilization that is on the brink of a disaster (especially if it is natural) and not do something. That is the right thing to do. I agree with that compassionate example. But what if there is a disease outbreak? Like smallpox on NA? (Hopefully advanced technology will stop that spread thanks to filters in transporters and powerful sensors and incredible medical advancements).
Or some other contamination, not physical, but social?

There is examples of “duck blind” observation of pre warp civilizations to learn about their development from a sociological and anthropological standpoint. Insurrection had one as well as two other episodes one I can’t remember. Who Watches the Watchers being one of them.
I wonder if the value of that, but I suppose there is some damage management there, especially seeing as there are so few stories relating to that.


Basically, I think the Prime Directive is required.
I think it is valid. And I think it is something that needs to also be flexible, and it is shown to be.
We are also talking about a TV show, where Kirk, Picard or even Archer on one of their many breakings of the Prime Directive was court marshalled and punished by imprisonment or demotion wouldn’t make for good tv of the era (it may now!)

Now Janeway in Voyager has some very interesting examinations on violating the Prime Directive because of her circumstance. 
Now, would you punish her upon her return to Earth?

I would. But the punishment would be minor. Maybe a promotion... A slap on the wrist, given what else she had done.

Some of my fondest 'bonding with my father' memories is watching TOS reruns after school in the 1980's with my father. He was 11 when the series came out and loved it, and got me into the series basically from birth, and I've been a lifelong fan as a result. 

That attitude of 'this isn't your father's Star Trek' is a blatant way to say 'we're turning this valuable intellectual property into something it isn't, but more average idiots will pay for it'. It's the most insulting and cynical approach to movie making I can think of. They might have well said, 'Hey, you dumb twats! Your dweeb dad liked this geeky shit, but we fixed it! Now it's cool or something! Come see this dumb ass movie!'

But Jim just BLASTS the RADIO LOUDER: JIM I CAN'T HEAR YOU! 51 EXT. IOWA ROAD - CONTINUOUS 51 George, bag over shoulder, thumb out.

Also, before 'Constitution Class' was a canon thing, the Enterprise was dubbed a 'Starship Class', as seen on the dedication plaque on the wall of the bridge, implying that other ships in the fleet weren't 'starships' I guess. 

So the Enterprise was probably the best asset they had against V'Ger, especially with her upgrades, even if she was rushed into service. One thing to support this is that her upgraded deflector screens held up against V'Ger's first attack, while the those poor Klingons certainly didn't fare as well.

No, it sends the message to the rest of the galaxy that ""We will not interfere with the internal politics of other societies because we practice what we preach - the Prime Directive.""

Regime change can neither be expected or realistically insisted upon as a condition for peace between two independent nations, and would further be a violation of the Prime Directive.

&gt; This is a woman that threatened famine, that bombarded words from orbit, that engaged in torture, murder and god knows what else. If the federation gets in bed with her they’re sending a message to everyone that they don’t really value justice. 

You don't think the Klingons (not to mention the Federation!) bombarded from orbit?  You don't think the Klingons murdered or tortured?  Yet the Federation was content to make peace with them.

The message the Federation would be sending is ""We value justice by making decent, ethical treatment a precondition of peace.""  Prosecuting Osyraa doesn't bring back the dead or restore lost years to those who were enslaved - but making peace helps prevent more dead and frees those that are still enslaved.  That matters a whole lot more.

&gt; Again this doesn’t seem to have anything to do with what I said or what we see in the show. The federation is materially helping its people’s lives, and the lives of others. We see that throughout the series. That doesn’t mean they have to condone the actions of a warlord. Long term that isn’t going to do the federation any favours.

It has *everything* to do with what you said, but perhaps you are confused by the use of ""they"" as a pronoun.

You said ""how many worlds that have suffered under the chain will continue to see the Federation as an ideal if they publically stand by a warlord slaver?""

So my response is ""what good is the Federation doing for those worlds [the ones suffering under the chain] by being seen as an ""ideal"" if the people on those worlds [the ones suffering under the chain] aren't having their lives being made materially better by the Federation?""

I'm pretty sure ""abolishing slavery"" is both a moral and material good that outweighs nearly anything the Federation has (or could) do so far, short of annihilating the Chain entirely (which they seem incapabe of doing, even if they were willing to).

&gt;  If the federation signed that treaty without stipulations that there should be consequences it would be like the end of the Second World War without the Nuremberg trials.

You're comparing apples and bowling balls.  The Second World War ended with unconditional surrender.  But we're talking about peace between two nations who both continue to operate independently.  We're not talking about the Federation taking over the Emerald Chain.

&gt; Those who suffered under the chain would receive the message loud and clear that the federation isn’t interested in getting them justice.

The Federation didn't insist on Gorkon being prosecuted for the crimes of the Klingon Empire.  Are you suggesting that the Federation was sending a message ""loud and clear"" to the worlds the Klingons conquered that they weren't interested in getting them justice?",,,1609645817,{},ghwaxzd,False,t3_knl507,False,True,t1_ghw8ffv,/r/startrek/comments/knl507/episode_discussion_star_trek_discovery_3x12_there/ghwaxzd/,1609647631,1,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,,0,[],,

Nobody pointed a phaser at them and forced them into the transporter after it was primed to merge them. The accident was not murder and should not be treated as such.

I wasn't equating the accident to murder, I was equating keeping them dead and killing them lol.

&gt; Frankly, yes. If two of my best friends died today in an accident and I could have them back instantly by murdering a completely innocent person I hope I would do the right thing, wish that person peace and accept that I won't see my friends again. Autocratically choosing to murder someone sets a terrible precedent and I firmly believe Janeway would have been court martialed had she done this in the Alpha Quadrant because she traded her principles for convenience at the expense of an innocent, sentient life. One may call me cold for not saving my friends, yet I find it even colder to trade one life for another (or two).

So instead of autocratically murdering one person you'd autocratically murder two people? Two friends no less, I wouldn't want to be your friend lol.

&gt; Ok, there's a lot to unpack here. I think everyone deserves life. It's not about how long someone lives, or if they lived ""a more virtuous"" life than someone else. It's about the principle of respecting free will and personal sovereignty. What happened to Tuvok and Neelix was tragic, but to take from one to give to another when the result is murder and erasure of that one's autonomy? No thank you. That's a dangerous path to follow.

You say you don't want to take one's autonomy but you want to take two people's autonomy? That's an even more dangerous path to follow lol.

&gt; This is exactly the kind of arbitrary dictatorship I'm decrying and honestly, this is essentially what Janeway did.

You really believe she killed Tuvix because Tuvix was 60 years old? lol

&gt; This is way out in left field. I'm not trampling Tuvok's or Neelix's rights at all. Their rights were respected all the way to the end. Nobody committed any crime or injustice against them

You say this yet you still want to kill Tuvok and Neelix lol. I'd say killing them is very much trampling Tuvok's or Neelix's rights lol.

&gt; yet you're assuming there's some massive debt that must be paid by Tuvix as if he murdered them.

Yet you want Tuvok and Neelix to pay a massive debt to keep Tuvix alive?

&gt; He's completely innocent.

Were Tuvok and Neelix not inocent? Granted Neelix could be annoying at times but that's not worth killing him lol.

&gt; My position is nobody's rights should be trampled, and though Tuvok and Neelix got the short end of the straw this time around, their rights were unmarred.

You don't think killing them is trampling and marring their rights?

&gt; It's sad, but they enjoyed autonomy.

No they didn't, they were dead and dependent on Janeway to save them. That's the opposite of autonomy lol.

&gt; Why is it ok to take away Tuvix's autonomy to reverse an accident which was nobody's fault, especially Tuvix's?

Why is ok to take away Tuvok and Neelix's autonomy to keep an accident which was nobody's fault, especially Tuvok and Neelix's?

&gt; Freedom for all should always be the gold standard and when we lose sight of that dictatorship takes over.

Yet you want to kill 2 people to save the life of 1 person. That sounds very dictator-y to me lol.

&gt; Let me remind you you're arguing for the murder of an innocent individual while dressing it up as ""justice"" because you're equating the accident with murder, which it most certainly was not.

This doesn’t seem to have anything to do with what I said, or what happened on the show.

&gt; She's adopting Federation values and reforms. That's not a veneer of legitimacy, that's the path to change. It’s actions, not words

Yes and the actions of the federation endorsing her by not insisting she stand trial is an action that says to the galaxy “we value our own stability over the atrocities you faced”. This is a woman that threatened famine, that bombarded words from orbit, that engaged in torture, murder and god knows what else. If the federation gets in bed with her they’re sending a message to everyone that they don’t really value justice.

Again this doesn’t seem to have anything to do with what I said or what we see in the show. The federation is materially helping its people’s lives, and the lives of others. We see that throughout the series. That doesn’t mean they have to condone the actions of a warlord. Long term that isn’t going to do the federation any favours.

Except that’s exactly what she asked them to do. Legitimise her and the chain.

No, they weren't murdered because it was a transporter accident. Equating the accident to murder doesn't make sense. Nobody pointed a phaser at them and forced them into the transporter after it was primed to merge them. The accident was not murder and should not be treated as such.

&gt; You say you don’t want Tuvok and Neelix to remain dead but you want to keep them dead for the benefit of Tuvix?

Frankly, yes. If two of my best friends died today in an accident and I could have them back instantly by murdering a completely innocent person I hope I would do the right thing, wish that person peace and accept that I won't see my friends again. Autocratically choosing to murder someone sets a terrible precedent and I firmly believe Janeway would have been court martialed had she done this in the Alpha Quadrant because she traded her principles for convenience at the expense of an innocent, sentient life. One may call me cold for not saving my friends, yet I find it even colder to trade one life for another (or two).

&gt; So as long as they lived for a while you think they don't deserve life? How does that work? So if Tuvix lived for longer than Neelix, you think just because of that Tuvix should be killed? You did say ""nobody lives forever"" and ""they had the time they had"" so by that logic everyone should be shipped off on an iceberg at 60 lol.

Ok, there's a lot to unpack here. I think everyone deserves life. It's not about how long someone lives, or if they lived ""a more virtuous"" life than someone else. It's about the principle of respecting free will and personal sovereignty. What happened to Tuvok and Neelix was tragic, but to take from one to give to another when the result is murder and erasure of that one's autonomy? No thank you. That's a dangerous path to follow.

&gt; by that logic everyone should be shipped off on an iceberg at 60 lol.

This is exactly the kind of arbitrary dictatorship I'm decrying and honestly, this is essentially what Janeway did.

&gt; Yet you want to trample the rights of both Tuvok and Neelix to live?

This is way out in left field. I'm not trampling Tuvok's or Neelix's rights at all. Their rights were respected all the way to the end. Nobody committed any crime or injustice against them and yet you're assuming there's some massive debt that must be paid by Tuvix as if he murdered them. He's completely innocent.

&gt; How does that come out better than only trampling one person's rights?

This is the issue. My position is nobody's rights should be trampled, and though Tuvok and Neelix got the short end of the straw this time around, their rights were unmarred. It's sad, but they enjoyed autonomy. Why is it ok to take away Tuvix's autonomy to reverse an accident which was nobody's fault, especially Tuvix's? Freedom for all should always be the gold standard and when we lose sight of that dictatorship takes over.

My problem is it's essentially a period piece. Like, it's set in a specific time in a fictional universe, but then completely abandons that style and look. And they gained nothing from being set in that time that I can see other than trying to use Sarek to get people into the show.

It's really weird in choices and execution that way. Like, if you were doing Saving Private Ryan, but decided that WW2 era military stuff is too 40s ish, and so put in drones and F35s and GPS because that's what people want to see in the ""modern era"". Well, that's a really weird way to tell a story about WW2.

And for all that they want to do a new thing, and be new Trek, they also kept calling back to and pushing things from TOS into the show.

And it doesn’t matter if the two have existed for more than two millennia and have borrowed from one another. It doesn’t matter that modern political science along with other academic courts that rule over other subjects, change the meaning of words and move the goal posts. 

A republic isn’t a democracy and vice versa. You can’t slap one upon another, ie there are no democratic republics. There are representative democracies and there are republics with limited degrees of elective elements. 

And frankly it’s the manipulation of these things that make people illiterate on the subject of political history generally but in the US particularly. It wouldn’t do not to change the narrative about what is and is not a republic or a democracy when you’re busy democratizing and therefore eroding the constitutional framework of a nation. That is the history of the US. Democratize, abuse, change the narrative. 

If people spent less time with the semantics and more with the history they’d know that the Roman republic wasn’t democratic in terms of how their people voted on laws and they’d know the same for the US. The complete opposite was true of Greece. 

And what many don’t know is that the US didn’t even have voting for the electors by the population in the early days of the republic. As many don’t know that there is no right to vote in federal elections even today. There are grounds for which voting in federal elections can’t discriminate, but the right to vote itself is absent because it didn’t exist to begin with. 

The power to vote in federal elections belongs in the hands of the state houses and over time they’ve devolved that to the people as part of the process of choosing electors. But it wasn’t always the case. And as the people elected their representatives to represent them in the house, the state houses voted the electors for president and voted for appointees to the senate to represent the states; equally two for each. 

But then we passed the 14th amendment to tax income directly on the promise it wouldn’t impact more than the top 2% of the wealthiest. And we couldn’t expand that taxing power without expanding the voting power for the political class. It’s also difficult to have endless wars without drumming up some popular ire or passing some of that power on from Congress to the president. So how do we do that. We democratize. So it’s a government of and by the people. A nonsense notion from a republican perspective. 

So the 14th amendment, the 17th amendment democratized the senate, and then in 1863 the last state, South Carolina democratizes the electoral college voting to the polling place.

The federal government expands into public education. Media and academia push the notion that we have a democracy and since we vote on every political position it seems we have no reason to complain because we get what we choose. 

But the US isn’t a democracy. It’s not written in the federal or any state constitutions. And no political scientist or dictionary have the ability to change the meaning of something because of a consensus of a group representing an authority. The history of something and it’s use and place in history does. If you’re legitimately interested you might study some of the earlier political campaigns of the early republic. If you’re interested in the difference between democracy and republic I would look at examples of Greek democracy in Athens and compare it to the centuriate of the Roman republic. As in the early American republic, even the romans did not allow direct election of public officers because they knew the weaknesses of democracy (they knew of the Greeks at that time).",,,1609642307,{},ghw53n6,False,t3_korqch,False,True,t1_ghw2zqu,/r/startrek/comments/korqch/hot_take_janeway_was_the_most_federation_captain/ghw53n6/,1609644528,1,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,,0,[],,

Discovery goes out of its way to  make the main character unlikable in the Pilot and does little for seasons to help us like any of the characters IMO. Because Discovery never earns any of its story beats or emotional points, we never really see Michael be heroic so much as messianic and the character is just soo grating. 

The problem is that Michael started with mutiny *per the show*. So now when she breaks the rules it just plays to me as, oh there she goes again, thinking she's above the law and knows ""best"". Rather than someone who is a representative of the ""good guys"" needing to be ""grey"" in spots. 

Then the entire Disco crew seems morally challenged - to the extent they couldn't figure out Lorca was Mirror, to the acceptance of Mirror Georgiou, to the literal toasting of her, etc. 

What's worse is that where previous shows usually showed many of these tropes as negative and the show seemed to be pointing out they're bad, Discovery seems to be embracing tokenism, groups segregating with themselves, and re-rehabilitating *anyone*.

Your definition of democracy differs heavily from what is commonly understood as a democracy. And while the words ""republic"" and ""democracy"" have different origins, there have been quite some historical developments between then and now that have shaped both terms and what they mean today.

Republic also doesn't just mean ""rule of law"", as that would be quite meaningless, considering that laws are man-made and (unless we find ourselves in a theocracy) not god given. 
The important part here is who decides what becomes law, which in a monarchy be the king/queen and in a republic ""the people"". A republic - like the US for example - could absolutely have a law that - for example - says that you can own another inhabitant of the same country or have laws that say that one person can vote and the other not, because one is a man and the other is a woman.

Republic and democracy are so closely intertwined that it is quite impossible to find a non-democratic republic, but it is easy to find non-republic democracies (like the UK). Yet both the UK and the US are representative-democracies. The UK is not a republic because it is a monarchy, not because it also happens to be a democracy.

As I already pointed out, a democracy that deviates from democratic values - even if decided by democratic vote - ceases to be a democracy.

There is a ton of problems with the show. It seems to have lost any semblance of science fiction for one. Now, that's not just a characteristic of DISCO when it comes to Trek. Later DS9 didn't involve much sci Fi either, turning to space opera.

The acting is frequently bad. Michael yelling rapidly at the suit and then it flying away and then her screaming/laughing/whatever didn't sell me on Sonequa's abilities but bad writing and direction can derail an acting job quick.

In terms of the other actors:

Adira looks like they straight up shit themselves in every shot.. just this queasy frown that the actor always portrays.

Tilly doesn't sell me at all on being a capable first officer because so much of the time when she's talked she talked about just herself... And in season one said she was autistic, but then suddenly the show makes her a strong decisive leader that people follow?

Grey is bad. He looks like he is trying to sell you drugs in high school. He's got this sleezy grin on and all of his line readings are bad.

Tig may be a funny comedienne but she is no actor. Getting a job just because you're a friend of AK doesn't mean we should have to watch her.

On top of that, I know nothing about most of the bridge crew. I know a few names. And there too many shots where people are talking so the camera does wierd spins or dutch angles... Shit that Battlefield Earth was lambasted for by Roger Ebert.

A compound word demos-Kratos meaning the people rule. And the the republic at a later time by the Romans and is a Latin compound of the words Res Publica which means, “the public thing”. In this context, the law. The Roman republic enshrined its law in a series of tablets which is a proto-constitutional idea, but reserving that which is to be foundational and above the whims or dictates of the majority. In the US we did the same thing with the constitution. It is why you can’t call something “hate speech” and ban people from saying said thing. Because the law is above the wishes of the people. 

As a contrast the UK is a representative democracy. A majority in parliament can change virtually anything in its representation of the will of the people. It can and has deemed certain terms to be hate speech. Overturning centuries of liberal tradition in the UK regarding speech. But that is the difference between a republic and a democracy. You can’t shove the two together and you shouldn’t conflate them. 

Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on dinner. A republic is the law stating that no one can be sacrificed as dinner, regardless of any vote. 

And the needs of the many is exactly an example of utilitarian ethics. You are correct. But in terms of governing philosophy it is very much in line with democracy in that the majority plus one are the many. They can override the consideration of the few or the one. 

It’s in my opinion an evil screed and one of the few things I dislike about the Vulcan philosophy which shares traits with Buddhism and stoicism. But the needs of the many outweigh the few or the one is at best a Mills-Ian construction. One often used to justify the worst crimes of humanity.

And while Voyager did show a previous storyline with a blood transfusion leading to a revival from death, at least Seven of Nine has literal zombie-making nanites in her blood that make sense for that. Khan is just a really strong human.

Decker clearly kept the Constellation in a hopeless fight for too long.  The Enterprise takes a number of hits from the machine with shields down without incurring a fraction of the damage sustained by the Constellation.

Decker makes a tactical error to battle the machine instead of withdrawing to alert Starfleet, who at the very least could scare up a relief force.

Decker can not necessarily be blamed for evacuating the Constellation, as he presumably did not know the machine would discontinue its attacks when the ship's energy signature fell below a threshold level.

I think part of the problem is the writing. People are interpreting the acting as being “bad” because in many cases, the emotions aren’t earned. 

When Burnham is crying, or elated, or exhausted, or frustrated — the actress is legitimately good at conveying those emotions. However, when she’s oscillating between them in the span of ten minutes, it’s going to seem erratic. 

And when the emotions of the characters are *so high*, which they tend to be in this show, there’s very little to compare it to. The “calm” moments are few and far between compared to the emotional ones, so there isn’t a lot of context.

Exactly. This leads onto a tangential point about why Starfleet doesn't use certain military technologies that other powers do, like cloaking devices.

You’re dwelling way too much on the “plead for their lives” bit and missing my actual point. 

&gt;	So you’re saying a person’s right to live stems from destiny?

No, Star Trek is saying that. Whether or not they deserve to live is a separate debate: but the point is you can’t compare these situations as they’re very, *very* different with different ethics and moral messages behind them. 

&gt;	So? What about being dead and no longer existing makes someone less deserving of life? That’s like saying asleep people are less deserving of consciousness lo

It’s not like saying that because unconscious people are still alive. My point is that these two people died because of a transporter accident. No fault of anyone’s.  It was an accident, and they’re gone. Tuvix, on the other hand, is alive and breathing and innocent. Their rights are not being violated from being dead: his are by being executed for doing nothing wrong.  

&gt;	Isn’t resurrecting them freeing them from the prison of death?

No, because there’s no such thing. Being dead isn’t being in a prison. It’s being dead and not experiencing anything. 

&gt;	were Tuvok and Neelix not both innocent and deserving of protection?

They were dead. They didn’t need protection because there was nothing to protect them from. There was no “them”. No Tuvix, no Neelix. You can’t compare living and dead people and give them the same rights.

SMG is an absolutely terrific actor, but the writers continue to shove her character into over-the-top, hyper-flag-waving situations where she has to over-emote to the point of exhaustion.

DIS's biggest flaw is that the writers constantly invert the rule of ""show, don't tell."" Virtually every encounter between the characters of Discovery is one of emotional exposition instead of actually living their virtues and *doing* their character arcs. It's all being spelled out instead of witnessed. 

This gets grating almost immediately in any story, be it TV, movie, or written word. 

But seriously, when the cast is given the chance to escape the lazy confines of the bad writing they're constantly handed, they absolutely shine.

I can't really find a good authoritative reference for the my claim on what the UFP was a metaphor for, although there are many discussions.  See below for authoritative reference on how the Klingons being a metaphor for Russian and Romulans being a metaphor for China. It infers what the UFP was a metaphor for, take it how you will.

Later races are more model around ideals, Cardasians being authoritarian, Ferengi being unchecked capitalists, etc. Although I don't think every race is a metaphor. I'd be hard pressed to say what the Breen, Tholian, or Domion were metaphors for.

&gt;Gene Coon primarily modeled the Klingons, metaphorically, on contemporary [Russians](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Russian), making the standoff between the species and the Federation representative of that between the Russians and the [Americans](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/United_States_of_America) during the then-ongoing Cold War.

I actually think the ""seeing your past hosts"" is just a retcon of the storytelling method used to convey the idea of previous hosts and their internal interactions.

I firmly believe that if Jadzia Dax had been created in this decade, instead of the 90s, then we would be seeing her hosts on screen (but only visible to her) quite a bit.  But that's because audiences today can ""get it"" as that kind of storytelling (where some on-camera characters are visible to one character, but not the rest) is normalized nowadays, whereas it would have just been seen as ""confusing"" in the 90s (or at least, the network execs would have insisted that it would be too confusing for general audiences).  I guess we can thank ""The Sixth Sense"" for the start of that normalization.

I also think this ""storytelling retcon"" makes for better storytelling, so I'm OK with it, in the same way that I""m OK with the ""visual retcon"" of having modern-day interfaces in pre-TOS tech look more advanced than it did in the 60s.

This is supported in ""The Doomsday Machine"", in which Commodore Decker's ship was heavily damaged.  If Decker had been a captain, Kirk could have refused his order to use the Enterprise to attack the planet-killer.  But since Decker hadn't been relieved of duty or declared medically unfit, he was able to take command of the Enterprise by pulling rank.

So, it's no surprise that Picard takes command of the fleet when there isn't an Admiral or Commodore to give orders, since both the Galaxy-class Enterprise-D and the Sovereign-class Enterprise-E are reliably the most powerful Starfleet ships wherever they go.

As far as the latest Enterprise remaining the flagship indefinitely, ""All Good Things..."" seems to indicate that isn't the case.

DIS seems much more hugely divisive in comparison and can be broken down from an objective viewpoint; it has measurable storytelling and character writing flaws. If these things were more solid, the lazy adherence to canon and the whole Michael Burnham premise would be forgivable by most I think.

It's not that big a problem to me. I just consider Abrams/Kurtzman to be non-canon. The massive tonal discrepancies of DIS and PIC make it really easy. The whole Kelvin / Prime timeline thing is ultimately a corporate construct that I can choose to ignore as easily as Nu Trek ignores its own legacy.",,,1609622548,{},ghv4kew,False,t3_koz6gk,False,True,t3_koz6gk,/r/startrek/comments/koz6gk/old_trek_vs_new_trek/ghv4kew/,1609624398,1,True,False,startrek,t5_2qixm,,0,[],,

[],,Joecool2008,,,[],,,,text,t2_15aw5q,False,False,[],"This is my personal experience from someone who watched TOS starting at  8 years old on VHS. I love the Kelvin Trek films because I think they captured much of the TOS spirit of an action/adventure science fiction show that allowed for social commentary.

I think the biggest reason why they get hated upon is because they moved outside of preconceived notions of Trek from prior eras, either TOS or TNG, and not be willing to move outside of that box. Star Trek had to be dramatic, and slower paced, and the characters had to behave a certain way,

&amp;#x200B;

In Abrams' Trek you find a Star Trek that was designed with a faster pace, and very 2000s sensibilities. And it felt very different from the 60s, 80s or 90s of prior Treks. And that is why I think there was such push back.

&amp;#x200B;

It was also one of the first times that classic characters like Kirk and Spock had been rebooted in this franchise. So, it was a bit like going from Adam West Batman to Burton Batman. Though, I would say, not quite that extreme. But, if one comes looking for TOS you're not going to find it.

&amp;#x200B;

Into Darkness was the one place of a misstep with Khan. Khan, to my mind, was completely unnecessary, and I'm not talking about casting. In a world of consciousness transfers cosmetic surgery to hide an identity is rather pedestrian. Having Khan invariably invites comparisons to what is considered Star Trek's best work. So, no matter what Abrams' and company did it would invite that comparing, and Into Darkness would come out poorly. 

&amp;#x200B;

To that end, I think Into Darkness is an OK film with a some excellent stand out parts, espeically with Kirk and his overall arc of learning to be a leader. I think Spock has great follow up from his own trauma of losing his planet and mom. There are excellent character moments throughout that film that still make it enjoyable for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond is a good film, largely because it continues on with Kirk and Spock. The villain is sadly less than memorable. Unfortunate, but Kirk and company are still great. Jaylah is a great addition.

&amp;#x200B;

All told, I think Abrams' Trek suffers from doing its own thing with characters that had, up until that film, only one interpretation.

My personal theory is that after the devastation of the Dominion War and the threat of further Borg incursions Starfleet decided that they needed to militarize fast or face extinction, thus the fast response fleet at the end of Picard. It makes sense to have a ready to go fleet of standardized warships, which makes manufacture, maintenance, and repair significantly more economical(the average Federation citizen may not have to deal with any form of economics but Starfleet does), practical, and efficient if you can have a single line producing parts and ships one after the other. It makes popping out a new ship significantly faster and so they can ramp their fleets up when needed in a much shorter time.

[],,maxis2k,,,[],,,,text,t2_ayrjz,False,False,[],"Series like TNG, DS9, VOY and ENT was met with the same issue all sequels have.  People are initially hesitant of different actors and tone.  But all those shows were eventually welcomed by the fanbase because they proved that they retained the tone of the previous series.  Both the visual tone (how the show was visibly shot) and the emotional tone (the content of the writing, character development, egalitarian message and so on).  All five of the first Star Trek shows had these principles that tied them all together.

The one exception to this was TNG, which changed the visual tone of how things were shot.  A lot less action and overacting of TOS with a style trying to mimic a dramatic movie, with flat cinematography and (mostly) grounded acting.  And saying flat cinematography is not a negative, which I'll go into in a minute.  But basically, after the big 'shock' of the transition between what was original Star Trek (TOS + season 1 of TNG) and the new more subdued and dramatic style (season 2 of TNG), the show pretty much stuck to that style all the way into Enterprise.  With the only exception being a few movies (mostly First Contact and Nemesis).

Fast forward to Star Trek 2009 and JJ Abrams completely changed everything.  Both the visual tone and the emotional tone were about as opposite of Star Trek as you can get, with excessive CGI, fast paced editing, all the main characters can only interact with sarcasm or rage at each other (in contrast to old Trek where the crew were friendly and professional to each other) and so on.  This is not at all like old Star Trek.  And JJ Abrams himself said he wanted it this way.  He outright said in interviews he hated Star Trek and wanted to reboot it into what he likes.  Which is basically Star Wars with a few Star Trek name drops.  It's not a coincidence that his Star Trek movies and his Star Wars movies have a similar tone (as well as Macguffin and Galaxy ending plots).  But he at least said they were an alternate dimension, so we could just think of them as that.  

When Discovery came out, Kurtzman (JJ Abrams understudy) literally repeated the same tone of the JJ Abrams movies, yet insisted they were the ""prime"" universe.  At a time when most fans were asking for a new post VOY series that returned to the tone of original Star Trek.  And many fans complained about this.  The people who talked about this were smeared as ""sexist"" or ""racist"" when they weren't talking about race or sex at all.  Pointing out that the writing gives Michael plot armor isn't sexist.  Pointing out that the whole Romulan plot in Picard is really weak is not racism, it has to do with how the Romulan plot is totally overtaken by the Borg plot and made pointless.

You can claim this is Star Trek ""evolving"" but I would say the exact opposite.  Because Star Trek hasn't evolved.  It's just turned into the same generic angry/action shows you see all over prime time TV.  It's basically Agents of Shield or Scandal in space.  When ironically, if they had made a new show that had the tone of TNG-ENT trek, it would stand out.

Wrath of Khan Pt 2: I mean, that sums it up right there. It was unoriginal, 'paid homage to'/replicated so many moments from the ToS (and movies) with *zero* emotional backing to them or any reason for events to happen like they did. They took WoK, said 'Lets do this but completely different!'* and made it the same thing, but flashy.

Beyond was... better. It still suffered from 'Hey they did this in Movie#3, let's do it too!' I understand the need to ~~sideline~~ destroy the Enterprise* - but there was no emotional *ooomph* to it. They just did it.

The big problem I have with the NuTrek movies is.. they don't deserve any of the big moments they shove into them, trying to replicate the original show/movies.

Now I love it because I got over my own bullshit and I like DISCO too.

“It’s bad writing—why is DS9 in the middle of everything in the galaxy? Why would you constantly have to have Sisko, who isn’t even a captain of a ship, lead the armada?

“Why would Starfleet intelligence need to tag an engineer from Deep Space Nine?

“So Kira is just magically part of the command structure whenever it suits them?”

And on and on. This is just how television works though. People don’t think about it for DS9 any more because it has been decades, but the same complaints were coming out.

Another one that I hated was this feeling that DS9 was making Trek more like Star Wars. They changed the phasers to be pew-pew-pew. There were a bunch of wars. Some of them at the time, like the Klingon War, seemed like it was just for the sake of there being more pew pew fights. And, again, the Klingons beam onto the station and Sisko is, like, taking out twenty Klingon warriors by himself with no weapons. Why is Deep Space Nine their only target? Because it has to be the center of the galaxy.

And I hated, and really still hate, Section 31 and the multiple Starfleet coups and making it a military organization instead of exploration and on and on.

Again, I love DS9 now. But everything people say about DISCO’s bad writing and wrenching a character into a plot for no reason is shit I objected to twenty years ago.
